Buildings  Chapter 99
Executive Summary
Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from buildings were 
in 2019 at 12 GtCO 2-eq, equivalent to 21% of global GHG 
emissions that year, out of which 57% were indirect emissions 
from offsite generation of electricity and heat, 24%  direct 
emissions produced onsite and 18% were embodied emissions 
from the use of cement and steel (high evidence, high 
agreement). More than 95% of emissions from buildings were 
CO2 emissions, CH 4 and N 2O represented 0.08%, and emissions 
from halocarbon contributed by 3% to global GHG emissions from 
buildings. If only CO 2 emissions would be considered, the share of 
CO2 emissions from buildings out of global CO 2 emissions increases 
to 31%. Global final energy demand from buildings reached 128.8 EJ 
in 2019, and global electricity demand was slightly above 43 EJ. The 
former accounted for 31% of global final energy demand and the latter 
for 18% of global electricity demand. Residential buildings consumed 
70% of global final energy demand from buildings. Over the period 
1990–2019, global CO 2 emissions from buildings increased by 50%, 
global final energy demand grew by 38% and global final electricity 
demand increased by 161% (high evidence,  high agreement) {9.3}.
Drivers of GHG emissions in the building sector were assessed 
using the SER (Sufficiency, Efficiency, Renewables) framework. 
Sufficiency measures tackle the causes of GHG emissions 
by avoiding the demand for energy and materials over the 
lifecycle of buildings and appliances. Sufficiency differs from 
efficiency in that the latter is about the continuous short-term marginal 
technological improvements, which allows doing less with more in 
relative terms without considering the planetary boundaries, while 
the former is about long-term actions driven by non-technological 
solutions (i.e., land-use management and planning), which consume 
less in absolute term and are determined by biophysical processes. 
Sufficiency addresses the issue of a  fair consumption of space and 
resources. The remaining carbon budget, and its normative target for 
distributional equity, is the upper limit of sufficiency, while requirements 
for a decent living standard define the minimum level of sufficiency. 
The SER framework introduces a hierarchical layering which reduces 
the cost of constructing and using buildings without reducing the 
level of comfort of the occupant. Sufficiency interventions in buildings 
include the optimisation of the use of building, repurposing unused 
existing buildings, prioritising multi-family homes over single-family 
buildings, and adjusting the size of buildings to the evolving needs 
of households by downsizing dwellings. Sufficiency measures do not 
consume energy during the use phase of buildings. 
In most regions, historical improvements in efficiency have 
been approximately matched by growth in floor area per capita. 
Implementing sufficiency measures that limit growth in floor 
area per capita, particularly in developed regions, reduces the 
dependence of climate mitigation on technological solutions 
(medium evidence,  medium agreement). At a global level, up to 
17% of the mitigation potential could be captured by 2050 through 
sufficiency interventions (medium evidence,  medium agreement). 
Sufficiency is an opportunity to avoid locking buildings in carbon-
intensive solutions. Density, compacity, building typologies, bioclimatic 
design, multi-functionality of space, circular use of materials, use of the thermal mass of buildings (to store heat for the cold season and 
to protect occupants from high temperatures (i.e., heatwaves), when 
designing energy services, moving from ownership to usership of 
appliances and towards more shared space, are among the sufficiency 
measures already implemented in the leading municipalities. At the 
global level, the main drivers of emissions include (i) population 
growth, especially in developing countries, (ii) increase in floor area 
per capita, driven by the increase of the size of dwellings while the 
size of households kept decreasing, especially in developed countries, 
(iii) the inefficiency of the newly constructed buildings, especially in 
developing countries, and the low renovation rates and ambition 
level in developed countries when existing buildings are renovated, 
(iv) the increase in use, number and size of appliances and equipment, 
especially ICT and cooling, driven by the growing welfare (income), 
and (v) the continued reliance on fossil fuel-based electricity and heat 
slow decarbonisation of energy supply. These factors taken together 
are projected to continue driving GHG emissions in the building sector 
in the future (high evidence,  high agreement) {9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 
and 9.9}.  
Bottom-up studies show a mitigation potential up to 85% in 
Europe and North America and up to 45% in Australia, Japan and 
New Zealand, compared to the baselines by 2050, even though 
they sometimes decline (robust evidence,  high agreement). In 
developing countries, bottom-up studies estimate the potential 
of up to 40–80% in 2050, as compared to their sharply growing 
baselines (medium evidence,  high agreement). The aggregation 
of results from all these bottom-up studies translates into 
a  global mitigation potential by 2050 of at least 8.2 GtCO2, 
which is equivalent to 61% of their baseline scenario. The largest 
mitigation potential (5.4 GtCO 2) is available in developing countries 
while Developed Countries will be able to mitigate 2.7 GtCO 2. These 
potentials represent the low estimates, and the real potential is likely 
to be higher. These estimated potentials would be higher if embodied 
emissions in buildings and those from halocarbons would be included 
(low evidence,  high agreement) {9.3, 9.6}.
The development, since the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report 
(AR5), of integrated approaches to construction and retrofit of 
buildings has led to the widespread adoption of zero energy/
carbon buildings in all climate zones. The complementarity and the 
interdependency of measures lead to cost reduction while optimising 
the mitigation potential grasped and avoiding the lock-in-effect. The 
growing consideration of integrated approach to construction of new 
buildings as well as to the renovation of existing buildings results in 
a lower relevance of the step-by-step approach to renovate buildings 
and to breaking down the potential into cost categories, as to deliver 
deep mitigation and cost savings technologies and approaches shall 
be applied together in an integrated and interdependent manner 
(medium evidence, high agreement). The potential associated with 
the sufficiency measures as well as the  exchange of appliances, 
equipment, and lights with efficient ones is at cost below 
USD0  tCO 2–1 (high evidence, high agreement). The construction of 
high-performance buildings will become by 2050 a business-as-usual 
technology with costs below USD20 tCO 2–1 in developed countries 
and below USD100 tCO 2–1 in developing countries (medium 
evidence, high agreement). For existing buildings, there have been 
Chapter 9 Buildings9many examples of deep retrofits where additional costs per  CO 2 
abated are not significantly higher than those of shallow retrofits. 
However, for the whole stock they tend to be in cost intervals of 
USD0–200 tCO 2–1 and >USD200 tCO 2–1 (medium evidence, medium 
agreement). Literature emphasizes the critical role of the decade 
between in 2020 and 2030 in accelerating the learning of know-how 
and skills to reduce the costs and remove feasibility constrains for 
achieving high efficiency buildings at scale and set the sector at the 
pathway to realise its full potential (high evidence, high agreement) 
{9.6, 9.9}.
The decarbonisation of buildings is constrained by multiple 
barriers and obstacles as well as limited flow of finance 
(robust evidence, high agreement). The lack of institutional 
capacity, especially in developing countries, and appropriate 
governance structures slow down the decarbonisation of the 
global building stock (medium evidence, high agreement). 
The building sector stands out for its high heterogeneity, with many 
different building types, sizes, and operational uses. Its segment 
representing rented property faces principal/agent problems where 
the tenant benefits from the decarbonisation investment made by the 
landlord. The organisational context and the governance structure 
could trigger or hinder the decarbonisation of buildings (high 
evidence, high agreement). Global investment in the decarbonisation 
of buildings was estimated at USD164 billion in 2020, not enough to 
close the investment gap (robust evidence, high agreement) {9.9}.
Policy packages based on the SER (Sufficiency, Efficiency, 
Renewables) framework could grasp the full mitigation 
potential of the global building stock (medium evidence, 
high agreement). Low ambitious policies will lock buildings in 
carbon for decades as buildings last for decades if not centuries 
(high evidence, high agreement). Building energy codes is the 
main regulatory instrument to reduce emissions from both 
new and existing buildings (high evidence, high agreement). 
Most advanced building energy codes include bioclimatic design 
requirements to capture the sufficiency potential of buildings, 
efficiency requirements by using the most efficient technologies and 
requirements to increase the integration of renewable energy solutions 
to the building shape. Some announced building energy  codes 
extend these requirements from the use phase to the whole building 
lifecycle. Building energy codes are proven to be especially effective 
if compulsory and combined with other regulatory instruments 
such as minimum energy performance standard for appliances and 
equipment, especially if the performance level is set at the level of 
the best available technologies in the market (robust evidence, high 
agreement). Market-based instruments such as carbon  taxes with 
recycling of the revenues and personal or building carbon allowances 
also contribute to foster the decarbonisation of the building sector 
(robust evidence, high agreement). Requirements to limit the use 
of land and property taxes are also considered effective policies to 
limit urban sprawl and to prioritise multi-family buildings over single-
family homes (medium evidence, high agreement) {9.9}. Actions are needed to adapt buildings to future climate while 
ensuring well-being for all. The expected heatwaves will 
inevitably increase cooling needs to limit the health impacts 
of climate change (medium evidence, high agreement). 
Global warming will impact cooling and heating needs but also the 
performance, durability and safety of buildings, especially historical 
and coastal ones, through changes in temperature, humidity, 
concentrations of CO 2 and chloride, and sea level rise. Adaptation 
measures to cope with climate change may increase the demand 
for energy and materials leading to an increase in GHG emissions 
if not mitigated. Sufficiency measures such as bioclimatic design 
of buildings, which consider the expected future climate, and 
includes natural ventilation, white walls and nature-based solutions 
(e.g.,  green roofs) will decrease the demand for cooling. Shared 
cooled spaces with highly efficient cooling solutions are among 
the mitigation strategies which can limit the effect of the expected 
heatwaves on people health. Sufficiency, efficiency, and renewable 
energy can be designed to reduce buildings’ vulnerability to climate 
change impacts (medium evidence, high agreement) {9.7, 9.8}. 
Well-designed and effectively implemented mitigation actions 
in the buildings sector have significant potential for achieving 
the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The impacts 
of mitigation actions in the building sector go far beyond the goal 
of climate action (SDG 13) and contribute to further meeting fifteen 
other SDGs. Mitigation actions in the building sector bring health 
gains through improved indoor air quality and thermal comfort as well 
as reduced financial stresses in all world regions. Overall decarbonised 
building stock contribute to well-being and has significant macro- and 
micro-economic effects, such as increased productivity of labour, job 
creation, reduced poverty, especially energy poverty, and improved 
energy security that ultimately reduces net costs of mitigation 
measures in buildings (high evidence,  high agreement) {9.8}.
COVID-19 emphasised the importance of buildings for human 
well-being. However, the lockdown measures implemented to 
avoid the spread of the virus have also stressed the inequalities 
in the access for all to suitable and healthy buildings, which 
provide natural daylight and clean air to their occupants  
(low evidence,  high agreement). Meeting the new WHO health 
requirements, has also put an emphasis on indoor air quality, 
preventive maintenance of centralised mechanical heating, ventilation, 
and cooling systems. Moreover, the lockdown measures have led to 
spreading the South Korean concept of officetel (office-hotel) to many 
countries and to extending it to officetelschool. The projected growth, 
prior to the COVID-19, of 58% of the global residential floor area 
by 2050 compared to the 290 billion m² yr –1 in 2019 might well be 
insufficient. Addressing the new needs for more residential buildings 
may not, necessarily mean constructing new buildings, especially in 
the global North. Repurposing existing non-residential buildings, no 
longer in use due to the expected spread of teleworking triggered by 
the health crisis and enabled by digitalisation, could be the way to 
overcome the new needs for officetelschool buildings triggered by the 
health crisis (low evidence,  high confidence) {9.1, 9.2}.
Buildings  Chapter 999.1 Introduction
Total GHG emissions in the building sector reached 12 GtCO 2-eq 
in 2019, equivalent to 21% of global GHG emissions that year, of 
which 57% were indirect CO 2 emissions from offsite generation 
of electricity and heat, followed by 24% of direct CO 2 emissions 
produced on-site and 18% from the production of cement and steel 
used for construction and/or refurbishment of buildings. If only 
CO2 emissions would be considered, the share of buildings CO 2 
emissions increases to 31% out of global CO 2 emissions. Energy 
use in residential and non-residential buildings contributed 50% 
and 32% respectively, while embodied emissions contributed 18% 
to global building CO 2 emissions. Global final energy demand from 
buildings reached 128.8 EJ in 2019, equivalent to 31% of global 
final energy demand. Residential buildings consumed 70% out of 
global final energy demand from buildings. Electricity demand from 
buildings was slightly above 43 EJ in 2019, equivalent to more than 
18% of global electricity demand. Over the period 1990–2019, global 
CO2 emissions from buildings increased by 50%, global final energy 
demand grew by 38%, with 54% increase in non-residential buildings 
and 32% increase in residential ones. Among energy carriers, the 
growth in global final energy demand was strongest for electricity, 
which increased by 161%.
There is growing scientific evidence about the mitigation potential of 
the building sector and its contribution to the decarbonisation of global 
and regional energy systems, and to meeting Paris Agreement goals and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (IPCC, 2018; IEA, 2019c; 
IEA 2019e). Mitigation interventions in buildings are heterogeneous 
in many different aspects, from building components (envelope, 
structure, materials, etc.) to services (shelter, heating, etc.), to 
building types (residential and non-residential, sometimes also called 
commercial and public), to building size, function, and climate zone. 
There are also variations between developed and developing countries 
in mitigation interventions to implement, as the former is challenged 
by the renovation of existing buildings while the latter is challenged by 
the need to accelerate the construction of new buildings. 
This chapter aims at updating the knowledge on the building 
sector since the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth 
Assessment Report (IPCC AR5) (Lucon et al. 2014). Changes since AR5 
are reviewed, including: the latest development of building service 
and components (Section  9.2), findings of new building related 
GHG emission trends (Section 9.3), latest technological (Section 9.4) 
and non-technological (Section  9.5) options to mitigate building 
GHG emissions, potential emission reduction from these measures 
at global and regional level (Section  9.6), links to adaptation 
(Section 9.7) and sustainable development (Section 9.8), and sectoral 
barriers and policies (Section 9.9). 
The chapter introduces the concept of sufficiency, identified in 
the literature as a  mitigation strategy with high potential, and is 
organised around the Sufficiency, Efficiency, Renewables (SER) 
framework (Box 9.1).
Box 9.1 | SER (Sufficiency, Efficiency, Renewables) Framework
The SER framework was introduced in the late 1990s by a French NGO (Negawatt 2017) advocating for a decarbonised energy transition. 
In 2015, the SER framework was considered in the design of the French energy transition law, and the French energy transition agency 
(ADEME) is developing its 2050 scenario based on the SER framework. 
The three pillars of the SER framework include (i) sufficiency, which tackles the causes of the environmental impacts of human 
activities by avoiding the demand for energy and materials over the lifecycle of buildings and goods, (ii) efficiency, which tackles the 
symptoms of the environmental impacts of human activities by improving energy and material intensities, and (iii) the renewables 
pillar, which tackles the consequences of the environmental impacts of human activities by reducing the carbon intensity of energy 
supply (Box 9.1, Figure 1). The SER framework introduces a hierarchical layering, sufficiency first followed by efficiency and renewable, 
which reduces the cost of constructing and using buildings without reducing the level of comfort of the occupant. 
Sufficiency is not a  new concept, its root goes back to the Greek word sôphrosunè, which was translated in Latin to sobrietas, 
in a  sense of enough (Cézard and Mourad 2019). The sufficiency concept was introduced to the sustainability policy debate by 
(Sachs 1993) and to academia by (Princen 2003). Since 1997, Thailand considers sufficiency, which was framed already in 1974 as 
Sufficiency Economy Philosophy, as a new paradigm for development with the aim of improving human well-being for all by shifting 
development pathways towards sustainability (Mongsawad 2012). The Thai approach is based on three principles (i) moderation, 
(ii) reasonableness, and (iii) self-immunity. Sufficiency goes beyond the dominant framing of energy demand under efficiency and 
behaviour. Sufficiency is defined as avoiding the demand for materials, energy, land, water and other natural resources while delivering 
a decent living standard for all within the planetary boundaries (Saheb 2021b, Princen 2005). Decent living standards are a set of 
essential material preconditions for human well-being which includes shelter, nutrition, basic amenities, health care, transportation, 
information, education, and public space (Rao and Baer 2012; Rao and Min 2018; Rao et al. 2019). Sufficiency addresses the issue 
of a fair consumption of space and resources. The remaining carbon budget, and its normative target for distributional equity, is the 
upper limit of sufficiency, while requirements for a decent living standard define the minimum level of sufficiency. Sufficiency differs 
from efficiency in that the latter is about the continuous short-term marginal technological improvements which allow doing more

with less in relative terms without considering the planetary boundaries, while the former is about long-term actions driven by non-
technological solutions (i.e., land-use management and planning), which consume less in absolute-term and are determined by the 
biophysical processes (Princen 2003).

Applying sufficiency principles to buildings requires (i) optimising the use of buildings, (ii) repurposing unused existing ones, 
(iii)  prioritising multi-family homes over single-family buildings, and (iv) adjusting the size of buildings to the evolving needs of 
households by downsizing dwellings (Wilson and Boehland 2005; Duffy 2009; Fuller and Crawford 2011; Stephan et al. 2013; Huebner 
and Shipworth 2017; Sandberg 2018; McKinlay et al. 2019; Ellsworth-Krebs 2020; Berrill et al. 2021) (Box 9.1, Figure 2). Avoiding the demand for energy and materials over the life-cycle of buildings and goods

Downsizing dwellings through cohousing strategies by repurposing existing buildings and clustering apartments when buildings 
are renovated and by prioritising multi-family buildings over single-family homes in new developments (Wilson and Boehland 2005; 
Duffy 2009; Fuller and Crawford 2011; Stephan et al. 2013; Huebner and Shipworth 2017; Sandberg 2018; McKinlay et al. 2019; 
Ellsworth-Krebs 2020; Ivanova and Büchs 2020; Berrill and Hertwich 2021) are among the sufficiency measures that avoid the 
demand for materials in the construction phase and energy demand for heating, cooling and lighting in the use phase, especially 
if the conditioned volume and window areas are reduced (Duffy 2009; Heinonen and Junnila 2014). Less space also means less 
appliances and equipment and changing preferences towards smaller ones (Aro 2020). Cohousing strategies provide users, in both 
new and existing buildings, a shared space (i.e., for laundry, offices, guest rooms and dining rooms) to complement their private space. 
Thus, reducing per capita consumption of resources including energy, water and electricity (Klocker et al. 2012; N. Klocker 2017), 
while offering social benefits such as limiting loneliness of elderly people and single parents (Wankiewicz 2015; Riedy et al. 2019). 
Senior cooperative housing communities and eco-villages are considered among the cohousing examples to scale-up (Kuhnhenn 
et al. 2020). Local authorities have an important role to play in the metamorphosis of housing by proposing communal spaces to be 
shared (Williams 2008; Marckmann et al. 2012) through urban planning and land-use policies (Duffy 2009; Newton et al. 2017). Thus, 
encouraging inter-generational cohousing as well as interactions between people with different social backgrounds (Williams 2008; 
Lietaert 2010). Progressive tax policies based on a cap in the per-capita floor area are also needed to adapt the size of dwellings to 
households’ needs (Murphy 2015; Akenji 2021). 
Efficiency, and especially energy efficiency and more recently resource efficiency, and the integration of renewable to buildings 
are widespread concepts since the oil crisis of the seventies, while only most advanced building energy codes consider sufficiency 
measures (IEA 2013). Efficiency and renewable technologies and interventions are described in Sections 9.4 and 9.9. 
A systematic categorisation of policy interventions in the building sector through the SER framework (Box 9.1, Figure 1) enables 
identification of the policy areas and instruments to consider for the decarbonisation of the building stock, their overlaps as well as 
their complementarities. It also shows that sufficiency policies go beyond energy and climate policies to include land-use and urban 
planning policies as well as consumer policies suggesting a need for a different governance including local authorities and a bottom-
up approach driven by citizen engagement. Housing and consumer policiesSize of buildings/appliancesAdjusting the size to the needs

Chapter 9 Buildings9Compared to AR5, this assessment introduces four novelties (i) the 
scope of CO 2 emissions has been extended from direct and indirect 
emissions considered in AR5 to include embodied emissions, (ii) beyond 
technological efficiency measures to mitigate GHG emissions in 
buildings, the contribution of non-technological, in particular of 
sufficiency measures to climate mitigation is also considered, 
(iii) compared to the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C 
(SR1.5), the link to sustainable development, well-being and decent 
living standard for all has been further developed and strengthened, 
and finally (iv) the active role of buildings in the energy system by 
making passive consumers prosumers is also assessed.
COVID-19 emphasised the importance of buildings for human well-
being, however, the lockdown measures implemented to avoid the 
spread of the virus has also stressed the inequalities in the access for 
all to suitable and healthy buildings, which provide natural daylight 
and clean air to their occupants (see also Cross-Chapter Box  1 in 
Chapter 1). COVID-19 and the new health recommendations (World 
Health Organization 2021) emphasised the importance of ventilation 
and the importance of indoor air quality (Sundell et al. 2011; Nazaroff 
2013; Fisk 2015; Guyot et al. 2018; Wei et al. 2020). The health crisis 
has also put an emphasis on preventive maintenance of centralised 
mechanical heating, ventilation, and cooling systems. Moreover, the 
lockdown measures have led to spreading the South Korean concept 
of officetel (office-hotel) (Gohaud and Baek 2017) to many countries 
and to extending it to officetelschool. Therefore, the projected growth, 
prior to the COVID-19, of 58% of the global residential floor area 
by 2050 compared to the 290 billion m² yr –1 in 2019 might well be 
insufficient. However, addressing the new needs for more residential 
buildings may not, necessarily mean constructing new buildings. In 
fact, repurposing existing non-residential buildings, no longer in use 
due to the expected spread of teleworking triggered by the health 
crisis and enabled by digitalisation, could be the way to overcome the 
new needs for officetelschool triggered by the health crisis.The four novelties introduced in this assessment link the building 
sector to other sectors and call for more sectoral coupling when 
designing mitigation solutions. Guidelines and methodologies 
developed in Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are adopted in this chapter. 
Detailed analysis in building GHG emissions is discussed based on 
Chapter 2 and scenarios to assess future emissions and mitigation 
potentials were selected based on Chapters, 3 and 4. There are 
tight linkages between this chapter and Chapter 6, 7, 8, 10 and 11, 
which are sectoral sectors. This chapter focusses more on individual 
buildings and building clusters, while Chapter  8 discusses macro 
topics in urban areas. Findings of this chapter provides contribution 
to cross-sectoral prospection (Chapter  12), policies (Chapter  13), 
international cooperation (Chapter  14), investment and finance 
(Chapter 15), innovation (Chapter 16), and sustainable development 
(Chapter 17).
9.2 Services and Components
This section mainly details the boundaries of the building sector; 
mitigation potentials are evaluated in the following sections.
9.2.1 Building Types
Building types and their composition affect the energy consumption for 
building operation as well as the GHG emissions (Hachem-Vermette 
and Singh 2019). They also influence the energy cost (MacNaughton 
et al. 2015) therefore, an identification of building type is required to 
understand the heterogeneity of this sector. Buildings are classified 
as residential and non-residential buildings. Residential buildings can 
be classified as slums, single-family house and multi-family house or 
apartment/flats building. Single-family house can be divided between 
single-family detached (including cottages, house barns, etc.) and

Buildings  Chapter 99single-family attached (or terrace house, small multi-family, etc.). 
Another classification is per ownership: owner-occupiers, landlords, 
and owners’ association/condominiums. 
Non-residential buildings have a  much broader use. They include 
cultural buildings (which include theatres and performance, 
museums and exhibits, libraries, and cultural centres), educational 
buildings (kindergarten, schools, higher education, research centre, 
and laboratories), sports (recreation and training, and stadiums), 
healthcare buildings (health, well-being, and veterinary), hospitality 
(hotel, casino, lodging, nightlife buildings, and restaurants and bars), 
commercial buildings and offices (institutional buildings, markets, 
office buildings, retail, and shopping centres), public buildings 
(government buildings, security, and military buildings), religious 
buildings (including worship and burial buildings), and industrial 
buildings (factories, energy plants, warehouses, data centres, 
transportation buildings, and agricultural buildings).
9.2.2 Building Components and Construction Methods
An understanding of the methods for assembling various materials, 
elements, and components is necessary during both the design and 
the construction phase of a  building. A building can be broadly 
divided into parts: the substructure which is the underlying structure 
forming the foundation of a building, and the superstructure, which is 
the vertical extension of a building above the foundation.
There is not a  global classification for the building components. 
Nevertheless, Figure  9.1 tries to summarise the building 
components found in literature (Mañá Reixach 2000; Asbjørn 2009; 
Ching 2014). The buildings are divided in the substructure and the 
superstructure. The substructure is the foundation of the building, 
where the footing, basement, and plinth are found. The superstructure 
integrates the primary elements (heavyweight walls, columns, floors 
and ceilings, roofs, sills and lintels, and stairs), the supplementary 
components (lightweight walls and curtain walls), the completion 
components (doors and windows), the finishing work (plastering and 
painting), and the buildings services (detailed in Section 9.3).
At a  global level, from historical perspective (from the Neolithic 
to the present), building techniques have evolved to be able to 
solve increasingly complex problems. Vernacular architecture has 
evolved over many years to address problems inherent in housing. 
Through a process of trial and error, populations have found ways 
to cope with the extremes of the weather. The industrial revolution 
was the single most important development in human history 
over the past three centuries. Previously, building materials were 
restricted to a few manmade materials (lime mortar and concrete) 
along with those available in nature as timber and stone. Metals 
were not available in sufficient quantity or consistent quality to 
be used as anything more than ornamentation. The structure was 
limited by the capabilities of natural materials; this construction 
method is called on-site construction which all the work is done 
sequentially at the buildings site. The Industrial Revolution 
changed this situation dramatically, new building materials 
emerged (cast-iron, glass structures, steel-reinforced concrete, steel). Iron, steel and concrete were the most important materials 
of the nineteenth century (Wright 2000; De Villanueva Domínguez 
2005). In that context, prefabricated buildings (prefabrication also 
known as pre-assembly or modularisation) appeared within the 
so-called off-site construction. Prefabrication has come to mean 
a method of construction whereby building elements and materials, 
ranging in size from a single component to a complete building, 
are manufactured at a  distance from the final building location. 
Prefabricated buildings have been developed rapidly since the 
Second World War and are widely used all over the world (Pons 
2014; Moradibistouni et al. 2018).
Recently, advances in technology have produced new expectations 
in terms of design possibilities. In that context, 3D printing seems 
to have arrived. 3D printing may allow in the future to build faster, 
cheaper and more sustainable (Agustí-Juan et  al. 2017; García 
de Soto et  al. 2018). At the same time, it might introduce new 
aesthetics, new materials, and complex shapes that will be printed 
at the click of a mouse on our computers. Although 3D printing will 
not replace architectural construction, it would allow optimisation 
of various production and assembly processes by introducing new 
sustainable construction processes and tools (De Schutter et  al. 
2018). Nevertheless, what is clear is that 3D printing is a technology 
still in development, with a lot of potentials and that it is advancing 
quite quickly (Hager et al. 2016; Stute et al. 2018; Wang et al. 2020). 
9.2.3 Building Services
Building services make buildings more comfortable, functional, 
efficient, and safe. In a  generic point of view, building services 
include shelter, nutrition, sanitation, thermal, visual, and acoustic 
comfort, entertainment, communications, elevators, and illumination. 
In a more holistic view building services are classified as shown in 
Figure 9.2. 
A building management system is a  system of devices configured 
to control, monitor, and manage equipment in or around a building 
or building area and is meant to optimise building operations and 
reduce cost (Schuster et al. 2019). Recent developments include the 
integration of the system with the renewable energy systems (Arnone 
et al. 2016), most improved and effective user interface (Rabe et al. 
2018), control systems based on artificial intelligence and internet of 
things (IoT) (Farzaneh et al. 2021).
The use of air conditioning systems in buildings will increase with 
the experienced rise in temperature (Davis and Gertler 2015; 
De Falco et al. 2016) (Figure 9.8). This can ultimately lead to high 
energy consumption rates. Therefore, adoption of energy efficient 
air conditioning is pertinent to balance the provision of comfortable 
indoor conditions and energy consumption. Some of the new 
developments that have been done include ice refrigeration (Xu et al. 
2017), the use of solar photovoltaic power in the air conditioning 
process (Burnett et al. 2014), and use of common thermal storage 
technologies (De Falco et al. 2016) all of which are geared towards 
minimising energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. 
Chapter 9 Buildings9
Building designs have to consider provision of adequate ventilation. 
Natural ventilation reduces energy consumption in buildings in warm 
climates compared to air conditioning systems (Taleb 2015; Azmi 
et al. 2017). Enhanced ventilation has higher benefits to the public 
health than the economic costs involved (MacNaughton et al. 2015). 
On the refrigeration systems, the recent developments include the 
use of solar thermoelectric cooling technologies as an energy efficient 
measure (Liu et  al. 2015b); use of nanoparticles for energy  saving 
(Azmi et al. 2017) to mention some. Lambertz et al. (2019) stated that when evaluating the environmental 
impact of buildings, building services are only considered in a very 
simplified way. Moreover, it also highlights that the increasing use 
of new technologies such as Building Information Modelling (BIM) 
allows for a much more efficient and easier calculation process for 
building services, thus enabling the use of more robust and complete 
models. Furthermore, recent studies on building services related to 
climate change (Vérez and Cabeza 2021) highlight the importance of 
embodied energy (Parkin et al. 2019) (Section 9.4).Building Services

Buildings  Chapter 999.3 New Developments in Emission 
Trends and Drivers
9.3.1 Past and Future Emission Trends
Total GHG emissions in the building sector reached 12 GtCO 2-eq in 
2019, equivalent to 21% of global GHG emissions that year. 57% 
of GHG emissions from buildings were indirect CO 2 emissions from 
generation of electricity and heat off-site, 24% were direct CO 2 
emissions produced on-site, and 18% were from the production 
of cement and steel used for construction and refurbishment of 
buildings (see Cross-Chapter Box 3 and Cross-Working Group Box 1 
in Chapter 3, and Figure 9.3a). Halocarbon emissions were equivalent 
to 3% of global building GHG emissions in 2019. In the absence of 
the breakdown of halocarbon emissions per  end-use sectors, they 
have been calculated for the purpose of this chapter, by considering 
that 60% of global halocarbon emissions occur in buildings (Hu et al. 
2020). CH 4 and N 2O emissions were negligible, representing 0.08% 
each out of the 2019 global building GHG emissions. Therefore, this 
chapter considers only CO 2 emissions from buildings. By limiting the 
scope of the assessment to CO 2 emissions, the share of emissions from 
buildings increases to 31% of global 2019 CO 2 emissions. Energy use 
in residential and non-residential buildings contributed 50% and 
32% respectively, while embodied emissions contributed 18% to 
global building CO 2 emissions.Over the period 1990–2019, global CO 2 emissions from buildings 
increased by 50%. Global indirect CO 2 emissions increased by 
92%, driven by the increase of fossil fuels-based electrification, 
while global direct emissions decreased by 1%. At regional level, 
emissions in residential buildings decreased in Developed Countries, 
except in Australia, Japan and New Zealand, while they increased 
in developing countries. The highest decrease was observed in 
Europe and Eurasia, with 13.6% decrease of direct emissions and 
33% decrease of indirect emissions, while the highest increase of 
direct emissions occurred in Middle East, 198%, and the highest 
increase of indirect emissions occurred in Eastern Asia, 2258%. 
Indirect emissions from non-residential buildings increased in all 
regions. The highest increase occurred in Eastern Asia, 1202%, and 
the lowest increase occurred in Europe and Central Asia, 4%, where 
direct emissions from non-residential buildings decreased by 51%. 
Embodied emissions have also increased in all regions. The highest 
increase occurred in Southern Asia, 334%, while the lowest increase 
occurred in North America, 4% (Figure 9.3b). 
Future emissions were assessed using four global scenarios and their 
respective baselines (Box  9.2). The selection of the scenarios was 
based on the features of each scenario, the geographic scope, and 
the data availability to analyse future building emissions based on 
the SER framework (Box 9.1).1990

and net zero emissions), IMAGE Lifestyle-Renewable scenario and Resource Efficiency and Climate Change-Low Energy Demand scenario (RECC-LED).  
RECC-LED data include only space heating and cooling and water heating in residential buildings. The IEA current policies scenario is included as a baseline scenario (IEA current 
policies scenario).
Box 9.2 | Scenarios Used for the Purpose of This Chapter
Three out of the four scenarios selected, and their related baselines, are based on top-down modelling and were submitted to AR6 
scenario database, which includes in total 931 scenarios with a building module (Annex III; see also Boxes 3.1 and 3.2, and Cross-
Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 3). A fourth scenario, not included in AR6 scenario database, and based on a bottom-up modelling approach 
was added. 
The main features of these scenarios are shortly described below while the underlying modelling approaches are described in Annex III. 
Each scenario is assessed compared to its baseline scenario: 
Buildings  Chapter 99
The IEA-NZE scenario projects emissions from the global building 
stock to be lowered to 29 MtCO 2 by 2050 against 1.7 GtCO 2 in the 
IEA-SDS and 3.7 GtCO 2 in IMAGE-LiRE Scenario. These projections 
can be compared to IEA-CPS in which global emissions from buildings 
were projected to be at 13.5 GtCO 2 in 2050, which is equivalent to 
the 2018 emissions level (Figure 9.3a). By 2050, direct emissions from 
residential buildings are projected to be lowered to 108 MtCO 2 in the 
IEA-NZE, this is four times less than the projected direct emissions in 
RECC-LED scenario, six times less than those under the IEA-SDS and 
eleven times less than those in the IMAGE-LiRE scenario. 
In the IEA-NZE scenario, indirect emissions are projected to be below 
zero by 2050 for both residential and non-residential buildings, 
while residual indirect emissions from residential buildings are 
projected to be 125 MtCO 2 in RECC-LED, 634 MtCO 2 in IEA-SDS, and 

residential buildings are projected to be at 1.7 GtCO 2 in IEA SDS and 
double of this in IMAGE-LiRE scenario (Figure 9.3a). Compared to 
IEA-SDS, the highest decrease of emissions in IEA-NZE is expected 
to occur after 2030. Direct emissions from residential buildings 
in IEA-NZE are projected to be, by 2030, at 1.37 GtCO 2, against 
1.7 GtCO 2 in the three other scenarios. The highest cut in emissions 
in IEA-NZE and in IMAGE-LiRE occur through the decarbonisation 
of energy supply. At regional level, by 2050, the lowest emissions are projected 
to occur in developed Asia and Pacific, with 6.73 MtCO 2 under 
RECC-LED scenario and 12.4 MtCO 2 under the IEA-SDS, and the 
highest emissions are projected to occur in Europe and Eurasia in all 
three scenarios, with 152 MtCO 2 in IEA-SDS, 199 MtCO 2 in RECC-LED 
scenario and 381 MtCO 2 in IMAGE-LiRE scenario. Emissions in Africa 
are projected to decrease to 10 MtCO 2 in RECC-LED, this is nine 
time less than those of 2019, while they are projected to increase by 
25% in IEA-SDS compared to those of 2019. Compared to IEA-SDS 
and IMAGE-LiRE, RECC-LED projects the highest decreases, over 
the period 2020–2030, of direct emissions in residential buildings 
in all regions, up to 45% in Australia, Japan and New Zealand, and 
Eastern Asia and the highest decreases of indirect emissions, ranging 
from 52% in Eastern Asia to 86% in Latin America and Caribbean. 
Over the same period, the IEA-SDS projects the highest decreases 
of indirect emissions to occur in Australia, Japan and New Zealand, 
and North America. IMAGE-LiRE projects the lowest decreases of 
emissions over the same decade in almost all regions (Figure 9.3b). 
Emissions per  capita from residential buildings at a  global level 
reached 0.85 tCO 2 per person in 2019. The four scenarios assessed 
project a  decrease of the global per  capita emissions by 2050, 
ranging from 0 tCO 2 in IEA-NZE 0.21 tCO 2 per  person in IMAGE-
LiRE, a 75% lower than those of 2019 (Figure 9.4a). There are great Box 9.2 (continued)

also a normative scenario, working backwards from climate, clean air, and energy access goals. SDS examines what actions would be 
necessary to achieve these goals. The near-term detail is drawn from the IEA Sustainable Recovery Plan, which boosts economies and 
employment while building cleaner and more resilient energy systems (IEA 2020c). 
Analysis of the IEA scenarios above was conducted compared to the 2019 Current Policies Scenario, which shows what happens if the 
world continues along its present path (IEA 2020c), and considered as a baseline scenario. 
IMAGE-Lifestyle-Renewable (LiRE) scenario is based on an updated version of the SSP2 baseline, while also meeting the RCP2.6 
radiative forcing target using carbon prices, together with the increased adoption of additional lifestyle changes, by limiting the 
growth in the floor area per capita in Developed Countries as well as the use of appliances. Regarding energy supply, IMAGE-LiRE 
assumes increased electrification and increased share of renewable in the energy mix (Detlef Van Vuuren et al. 2021). 
Resource Efficiency and Climate Change-Low Energy Demand (RECC-LED) scenario is produced by a global bottom-up model, 
which assesses contributions of resource efficiency to climate change mitigation. RECC-LED estimates the energy and material flows 
associated with housing stock growth, driven by population and the floor area per  capita (Pauliuk et  al. 2021). This scenario is 
informed by the Low Energy Demand Scenario (LED), which seeks convergence between developed and developing countries in the 
access to decent living standard (Grubler et al. 2018). 
For consistency between the four scenarios, aggregation of regions in this chapter differs from the one of the IPCC. Europe and Eurasia 
have been grouped into one single region.

to 0.65 tCO 2 in IMAGE-LiRE.
9.3.2 Drivers of CO 2 Emissions and Their 
Climate Impact
Building specific drivers of GHG emissions in the four scenarios 
described above are assessed using an index decomposition analysis 
with building specific identities and reflecting the three pillars of 
the Sufficiency, Efficiency, Renewables (SER) framework. Broad 
drivers of GHG emissions such as GDP and population are analysed 
using a Kaya decomposition in Chapter 2. Previous decompositions 
analysing drivers of global GHG emissions in the building sector have 
either assessed only the impact of GDP and population as drivers of 
GHG emissions (Lamb et al. 2021) or the impact of building specific 
drivers on energy demand and not on CO 2 emissions (Lucon et al. 
2014; Ürge-Vorsatz et al. 2015; IEA 2020c; ODYSSEE 2020). For this 
assessment, the decomposition was conducted for energy-related 
CO2 emissions for residential buildings only, due to lack of data for 
non-residential buildings. 
The attribution of changes in emissions in the use phase to changes 
in the drivers of population, sufficiency, efficiency, and carbon 
intensity of energy supply is calculated using additive log-mean 
divisia index decomposition analysis (Ang and Zhang 2000). The decomposition of emissions into four driving factors is shown in 
Equation 1, where m2 refers to total floor area, EJ  refers to final 
energy demand, and MtCO 2 refers to the sum of direct and indirect 
CO2 emissions in the use phase. The allocation of changes in emissions 
between two cases k and k–1 to changes in a single driving factor D 
is shown in Equation  2. To calculate changes in emissions due to 
a single driver such as population growth, D will take on the value of 
population in the two compared cases. The superscript k stands for 
the case, defined by the time period and scenario of the emissions, for 
example, IEA-CPS baseline scenario in 2050. When decomposing 
emissions between two cases k and k–1, either the time-period, or 
the scenario remains constant. The decomposition was done at the 
highest regional resolution available from each model output, and 
then aggregated to regional or global level. For changes in emissions 
within a  scenario over time, the decomposition is done for every 
decade, and the total 2020–2050 decomposition is then produced by 
summing decompositions of changes in emissions each decade.  
Equation 9.1

Over the period 1990–2019, population growth accounted for 28%

for 52% and increasing carbon intensity of the global energy mix 
accounted for 16%. Efficiency improvement contributed to decreasing 
global emissions from residential buildings by 49% (Figure 9.5a). The 
sufficiency potential was untapped in all regions over the same period 
while the decarbonisation of the supply was untapped in developing 
countries and to some extent in Asia-Pacific Developed. The highest 
untapped sufficiency and supply decarbonisation potentials occurred 
in Southern Asia where the lack of sufficiency measures has led to 
increasing emissions by 185% and the high carbon intensity of the 
energy mix has led to increasing emissions by 340%. In Developed Countries, the highest untapped sufficiency potential occurred in 
Asia-Pacific Developed region. Middle East is the only region where 
efficiency potential remained untapped (Figure 9.5b).
Scenarios assessed show an increase of the untapped sufficiency 
potential at the global level over the period 2020–2050. The highest 
untapped sufficiency potential occurs in IEA scenarios as there are 
no changes in the floor area per  capita across different scenarios.

Figure 9.5 (continued): Decompositions of changes in historical residential energy emissions 1990–2019, changes in emissions projected by baseline 
scenarios for 2020–2050, and differences between scenarios in 2050 using scenarios from three models: IEA, IMAGE, and RECC.  RECC-LED data include 
only space heating and cooling and water heating in residential buildings (a) global resolution, and (b) for nine world regions.  Emissions are decomposed 
based on changes in driver variables of population, sufficiency (floor area per capita), efficiency (final energy per floor area), and renewables (GHG emissions per final energy). 
‘Renewables’ is a summary term describing changes in GHG intensity of energy supply. Emission projections to 2050, and differences between scenarios in 2050, demonstrate 
mitigation potentials from the dimensions of the SER framework realised in each model scenario. In most regions, historical improvements in efficiency have been approximately 
matched by growth in floor area per capita. Implementing sufficiency measures that limit growth in floor area per capita, particularly in developed regions, reduces the 
dependence of climate mitigation on technological solutions.

Figure 9.6 | Per capita floor area: historical based on IEA data and future emissions based on two IEA scenarios (sustainable development, and net zero 
emissions), IMAGE Lifestyle-Renewable scenario and Resource Efficiency and Climate Change-Low Energy Demand scenario (RECC-LED).  RECC-LED data 
include only space heating and cooling and water heating in residential buildings. The IEA current policies scenario is included as a baseline scenario (IEA current policies scenario).
Chapter 9 Buildings9effect. By setting a cap in the growth of the floor area per capita 
in developed countries, 5% of emission reductions in IMAGE-LiRE 
scenario derives from sufficiency. However, compared to 2020, the 
lack of sufficiency measures in the baseline scenario will contribute 
to increasing emissions by 31%. RECC-LED scenario shows the 
highest global sufficiency potential captured compared to its 
baseline scenario in 2050 as this scenario assumes a reduction in the 
floor area per capita in Developed Countries and slower floor area 
growth in emerging economies. The four scenarios show a  higher 
contribution of the decarbonisation of energy supply to reducing 
emissions than the reduction of energy demand through sufficiency 
and efficiency measures (Figure 9.6a). At regional level, the emissions 
reduction potential from sufficiency is estimated at 25% in North 
America under both IMAGE-LiRE and RECC-LED scenarios and at 
19% in both Eastern Asia and Europe/Eurasia regions (Figure 9.6b). 
The highest decarbonisation potential due to growth of renewable 
energy is 75% in Southern Asia under IMAGE-LiRE scenario. 
There is a growing literature on the decarbonisation of end-use sectors 
while providing decent living standard for all (Rao and Pachauri 2017; 
Grubler et  al. 2018; Rao and Min 2018; Rao et  al. 2019; Millward-
Hopkins et  al. 2020). The floor area per  capita is among the gaps 
identified in the convergence between developed and developing 
countries in the access to decent living (Kikstra et  al. 2021) while 
meeting energy needs. In the Low Energy Demand (LED) scenario, 

et al. 2018) while in the Decent Living with minimum Energy (DLE) 
scenario, (Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020) assumes 15 m² per capita.
Overall, the global residential building stock grew by almost 30% 
between 2005 and 2019. However, this growth was not distributed equally across regions and three out of the four scenarios assessed 
do not assume a convergence, by 2050, in the floor area per capita, 
between developed and developing countries. Only RECC-LED 
implements some convergence between Developed Countries and 
emerging economies to a range of 20–40 m² per capita. IEA scenarios 
assume a growth in the floor area per capita in all regions with the 
highest growth in Developed Countries, up to 72 m² per capita in 
North America from 66 m² per capita in 2019. IMAGE-LiRE projects 
a floor area per capita in Africa at 14 m² per person. This is lower than 
the one of 2019, which was at 16 m² per capita (Figure 9.6). Beyond 
capturing the sufficiency potential by limiting the growth in the floor 
area per capita in Developed Countries while ensuring decent living 
standard, the acceptability of the global scenarios by developing 
countries is getting attraction in academia (Hickel et al. 2021). 
9.3.3 Energy Demand Trends
Global final energy demand from buildings reached 128.8 EJ in 2019, 
equivalent to 31% of global final energy demand. The same year, 
residential buildings consumed 70% out of global final energy demand 
from buildings. Over the period 1990–2019, global final energy 
demand from buildings grew by 38%, with 54% increase in non-
residential buildings and 32% increase in residential ones. At regional 
level, the highest increase of final energy demand occurred in Middle 
East and Africa in residential buildings and in all South-East Asia and 
Pacific in non-residential ones. By 2050, global final energy demand 
from buildings is projected to be at 86 EJ in IEA-NZE, 111 EJ in IEA-SDS 
and 138 EJ in IMAGE-LiRE. RECC-LED projects the lowest global final 
energy demand, at 15.7 EJ by 2050, but this refers to water heating, 
space heating and cooling in residential buildings only (Figure 9.7a).1990

Buildings  Chapter 99
Over the period 1990–2019, the use of coal decreased at a global 
level by 59% in residential buildings and 52% in non-residential 
ones. Solar thermal experienced the highest increase, followed by 
geothermal  and electricity. However, by 2019, solar thermal and 
geothermal contributed by only 1% each to global final energy 
demand, while electricity contributed by 51% in non-residential 
buildings and 26% in residential ones. The same year, gas contributed 
by 26% to non-residential final energy demand and 22% to residential 
final energy demand, which makes gas the second energy carrier 
used in buildings after electricity. Over the period 1990–2019, the use of gas grew by 75% in residential buildings and by 46% in non-
residential ones. By 2050, RECC-LED projects electricity to contribute 
by 71% to final energy demand in residential buildings, against 62% 
in IEA-NZE and 59% in IMAGE-LiRE. IEA-NZE is the only scenario to 
project less than 1% of gas use by 2050 in residential buildings while 
the contribution of electricity to energy demand of non-residential 
buildings is above 60% in all scenarios. At regional level, the use of 
coal in buildings is projected to disappear while the use of electricity 
is projected to be above 50% in all regions by 2050 (Figure 9.7b). 1990

scenario (IEA current policies scenario).
Chapter 9 Buildings9Hydrogen emerged in the policy debate as an important energy 
carrier for the decarbonisation of the energy system. In the case of the 
building sector, depending on how hydrogen is sourced (Box 12.3), 
converting gas grids to hydrogen might be an appealing option to 
decarbonise heat without putting additional stress on the electricity 
grids. However, according to (Element Energy Ltd 2018; Strbac et al. 
2018; Frazer-Nash Consultancy 2018; Broad et  al. 2020; Gerhardt 
et al. 2020) the delivered cost of heat from hydrogen would be much 
higher than the cost of delivering heat from heat pumps, which could 
also be used for cooling. Repurposing gas grids for pure hydrogen 
networks will also require system modifications such as replacement 
of piping and replacement of gas boilers and cooking appliances, 
a factor cost to be considered when developing hydrogen roadmaps 
for buildings. There are also safety and performance concerns with 
domestic hydrogen appliances (Frazer-Nash Consultancy 2018). Over 
the period 1990–2019, hydrogen was not used in the building sector 
and scenarios assessed show a  very modest role for hydrogen in 
buildings by 2050 (Figure 9.7). 
In Developed Countries, biomass is used for generating heat and 
power leading to reduction of indirect emissions from buildings 
(Ortwein 2016) (IEA et al. 2020 c). However, according to (IEA 2019b) 
despite the mitigation potential of biomass, if the wood is available 
locally, its use remains low in Developed Countries. Biomass is 
also used for efficient cook stoves and for heating using modern 
appliances such as pellet-fed central heating boilers. In developing 
countries, traditional use of biomass is characterised by low efficiency 
of combustion (due to low temperatures) leading to high levels of 
pollutants and CO output, as well as low efficiency of heat transfer. 
The traditional use of biomass is associated with public health risks 
such as premature deaths related to inhaling fumes from cooking (Dixon et al. 2015; Van de Ven et al. 2019; IEA 2019a; Taylor et al. 
2020). According to (Hanna et al. 2016) policies failed in improving 
the use of biomass. Over the period 1990–2019, the traditional 
use of biomass decreased by 1% and all scenarios assessed do not 
project any traditional use of biomass by 2050. Biomass is also used 
for the construction of buildings, leading to low embodied emissions 
compared to concrete (Heeren et al. 2015; Hart and Pomponi 2020; 
Pauliuk et al. 2021). 
Over the period 1990–2019, space heating was the dominant end-use 
in residential buildings at a global level, followed by water heating, 
cooking, and connected and small appliances (Figure 9.8a). However, 
energy demand from connected and small appliances experienced 
the highest increase, 280%, followed by cooking, 89%, cooling, 75%, 
water heating, 73% and space heating, around 10%. Space heating 
energy demand is projected to decline over the period 2020–2050 
in all scenarios assessed. RECC-LED projects the highest decrease, 
77%, of space heating energy demand, against 68% decrease in the 
IEA-NZE. IMAGE-LiRE projects the lowest decrease of heating energy 
demand, 21%. To the contrary, all scenarios confirm cooling as 
a strong emerging trend (Box 9.3) and project an increase of cooling 
energy demand. IMAGE-LiRE projects the highest increase, 143% 
against 45% in the IEA-NZE while RECC-LED projects the lowest 
increase of cooling energy demand, 32%.
There are great differences in the contribution of each end-use to the 
regional energy demand (Figure 9.8b). In 2019, more than 50% of 
residential energy demand in Europe and Eurasia was used for space 
heating while there was no demand for space heating in Middle East, 
reflecting differences in climatic conditions. To the contrary, the share 
of energy demand from cooking out of total represented 53% in the 1990

Middle East against 5% in Europe and Eurasia reflecting societal 
organisations. The highest contribution of energy demand from 
connected and small appliances to the regional energy demand was 
observed in 2019 in the Asia-Pacific Developed, 24%, followed by the 
region of Southern Asia, South-East Asia and Developing Pacific, with 
17%. Energy demand from cooling was at 9% out of total energy 
demand of Southern Asia, South-East Asia and Developing Pacific 
and at 8% in both Middle East and North America while it was at 
1% in Europe in 2019. 
The increased cooling demand can be partly explained by the 
increased ownership of room air-conditioners per  dwellings in all regions driven by increased wealth and the increased ambient 
temperatures due to global warming (Cayla et al. 2011; Liddle and 
Huntington 2021) (Box 9.3). The highest increase, 32%, in ownership 
of room air-conditioners was observed in Southern Asia and South-
East Asia and Developing Pacific while Europe, Latin America and 
Caribbean countries, Eastern Asia and Africa experienced an increase 
of 21% in households’ ownership of room air-conditioners. The 
lowest increases in room air-conditioners ownership were observed 
in the Middle East and North America with 1% and 8% each as these 
two markets are almost saturated. All scenarios assessed project an 
increase of ownership of cooling appliances in all regions over the 
period 2020–2050. 1990

Chapter 9 Buildings9Energy demand from connected and small appliances was, at a global 
level, above 7 EJ in 2019 (Figure  9.8a). However, it is likely that 
global energy demand from connected and small appliances is much 
higher as reported data do not include all the connected and small 
appliances used by households and does not capture energy demand 
from data centres (Box 9.3). Over the period 1990–2019, the highest 
increase of energy demand from connected and small appliances, 
4740%, was observed in Eastern Asia, followed by Southern Asia, 
1358% while the lowest increase, 99%, occurred in Asia-Pacific 
Developed countries. The increase of energy demand from connected 
and small appliances is driven by the ownership increase of such appliances all over the world. The highest increase in ownership of 
connected appliances, 403%, was observed in Eastern Asia and the 
lowest increase in ownership of connected appliances was observed 
in North America, 94%. Future energy demand is expected to occur 
in the developing world given the projected rate of penetration of 
household appliances and devices (Wolfram et al. 2012). However, 
(Grubler et al. 2018) projects a lower energy demand from connected 
and small appliances by assuming an increase of shared appliances 
and multiple appliances and equipment will be integrated into units 
delivering multiple services.
Box 9.3 | Emerging Energy Demand Trends in Residential Buildings
Literature assessed points to three major energy demand trends:
Cooling energy demand 
In a warming world (IPCC 2021) with a growing population and expanding middle-class, the demand for cooling is likely to increase 
leading to increased emissions if cooling solutions implemented are carbon intensive (Santamouris 2016; Sustainable Energy for All 
2018; Dreyfus et al. 2020b; Kian Jon et al. 2021; UNEP and IEA 2020). Sufficiency measures such as building design and forms, which 
allow balancing the size of openings, the volume, the wall and window area, the thermal properties, shading, and orientation are all 
non-cost solutions, which should be considered first to reduce cooling demand. Air conditioning systems using halocarbons are the 
most common solutions used to cool buildings. Up to 4 billion cooling appliances are already installed and this could increase to up 
to 14 billion by 2050 (Peters 2018; Dreyfus et al. 2020b). Energy efficiency of air conditioning systems is of a paramount importance 
to ensuring that the increased demand for cooling will be satisfied without contributing to global warming through halocarbon 
emissions (Campbell 2018; Shah et al. 2015, 2019; UNEP and IEA 2020). The installation of highly efficient technological solutions with 
low global warming potential (GWP), as part of the implementation of the Kigali amendment to the Montreal Protocol, is the second 
step towards reducing GHG emissions from cooling. Developing renewable energy solutions integrated to buildings is another track 
to follow to reduce GHG emissions from cooling. 
Electricity energy demand
Building electricity demand was slightly above 43 EJ in 2019, which is equivalent to more than 18% of global electricity demand. Over 
the period 1990–2019, electricity demand increased by 161%. The increase of global electricity demand is driven by the combination 
of rising incomes, income distribution and the S-curve of ownership rates (Wolfram et al. 2012; Gertler et al. 2016). Electricity is used 
in buildings for plug-in appliances, in other words, refrigerators, cleaning appliances, connected and small appliances and lighting. 
An important emerging trend in electricity demand is the use of electricity for thermal energy services (cooking, water and space 
heating). The increased penetration of heat pumps is the main driver of the use of electricity for heating. Heat pumps used either 
individually or in conjunction with heat networks can provide heating in cold days and cooling in hot ones. (Lowes et al. 2020) 
suggests electricity is expected to become an important energy vector to decarbonise heating. However, the use of heat pumps will 
increase halocarbon emissions (UNEP and IEA 2020). Connolly (2017), Bloess et al. (2018), and Barnes and Bhagavathy (2020) argue 
for electrification of heat as a cost-effective decarbonisation measure, if electricity is supplied by renewable energy sources (Ruhnau 
et al. 2020). The electrification of the heat supplied to buildings is likely to lead to an additional electricity demand and consequently 
additional investment in new power plants. Thomaßen et al. (2021) identifies flexibility as a key enabler of larger heat electrification 
shares. Importantly, heat pumps work at their highest efficiency level in highly efficient buildings and their market uptake is likely to 
require incentives due to their high up-front cost (Hannon 2015; Heinen et al. 2017). 
Digitalisation energy demand
Energy demand from digitalisation occurs in data centres, which are dedicated buildings or part of buildings for accommodating 
large amount of information technologies equipment such as servers, data storage and communication devices, and network devices. 
Data centres are responsible for about 2% of global electricity consumption (Avgerinou et al. 2017; Diguet and Lopez 2019). Energy 
demand from data centres arises from the densely packed configuration of information technologies, which is up to 100 times higher 
than a standard office accommodation (Chu and Wang 2019). Chillers combined with air handling units are usually used to provide 
cooling in data centres. Given the high cooling demand of data centres, some additional cooling strategies, such as free cooling, 
liquid cooling, low-grade waste heat recovery, absorption cooling and so on, have been adopted. In addition, heat recovery can

9.4 Mitigation Technological Options 
and Strategies Towards Zero 
Carbon Buildings
Literature in this topic is extensive, but unfortunately, most studies 
and reviews do not relate themselves to climate change mitigation, 
therefore there is a clear gap in reporting the mitigation potential 
of the different technologies (Cabeza et  al. 2020). It should be 
highlighted that when assessing the literature, it is clear that a lot 
of new research is focused on the improvement of control systems, 
including the use of artificial intelligence or internet of things (IoT).
This section is organised as follow. First, the key points from AR5 
and special reports are summarised, following with a  summary of 
the technological developments since AR5, specially focusing on 
residential buildings.
9.4.1 Key Points From AR5 and Special Reports
The AR5 WG3 Chapter 9 on Buildings (Lucon et al. 2014) presents 
mitigation technology options and practices to achieve large 
reductions in building energy use as well as a synthesis of documented 
examples of large reductions in energy use achieved in real, new, and 
retrofitted buildings in a variety of different climates and examples 
of costs at building level. A key point highlighted is the fact that the 
conventional process of designing and constructing buildings and 
its systems is largely linear, losing opportunities for the optimisation of whole buildings. Several technologies are listed as being able to 
achieve significant performance improvements and cost potentials 
(daylighting and electric lighting, household appliances, insulation 
materials, heat pumps, indirect evaporative cooling, advances in 
digital building automation and control systems, and smart meters 
and grids to implement renewable electricity sources).
9.4.2 Embodied Energy and Embodied Carbon
9.4.2.1 Embodied Energy and Embodied Carbon  
in Building Materials
As building energy demand is decreased the importance of 
embodied energy and embodied carbon in building materials 
increases (Ürge-Vorsatz et  al. 2020). Buildings are recognised as 
built following five building frames: concrete, wood, masonry, steel, 
and composite frames (International Energy Agency 2019a); but 
other building frames  should be considered to include worldwide 
building construction practice, such as rammed earth and bamboo in 
vernacular design (Cabeza et al. 2021).
The most prominent materials used following these frames 
classifications are the following. Concrete, a  man-made material, 
is the most widely used building material. Wood has been used for 
many centuries for the construction of buildings and other structures 
in the built environment; and it remains as an important construction 
material today. Steel is the strongest building material; it is mainly Box 9.3 (continued)
provide useful heat for industrial and building applications. More recently, data centres are being investigated as a potential resource 
for demand response and load balancing (Zheng et al. 2020; Koronen et al. 2020). Supplying data centres with renewable energy 
sources is increasing (Cook et al. 2014) and is expected to continue to increase (Koomey et al. 2011). Estimates of energy demand from 
digitalisation (connected and small appliances, data centres, and data networks) combined vary from 5% to 12% of global electricity 
use (Gelenbe and Caseau 2015; Malmodin and Lundén 2018; Ferreboeuf 2019; Diguet and Lopez 2019). According to (Ferreboeuf 
2019) the annual increase of energy demand from digitalisation could be limited to 1.5% against the current 4% if sufficiency 
measures are adopted along the value chain. 
Digitalisation occurs also at the construction stage. (European Union 2019; Witthoeft and Kosta 2017) identified seven digital 
technologies already in use in the building sector. These technologies include (i) Building Information Modelling/Management (BIM), 
(ii) additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, (iii) robots, (iv) drones, (v) 3D scanning, (vi) sensors, and (vii) internet of things 
(IoT). BIM supports decision making in the early design stage and allows assessing a variety of design options and their embodied 
emissions (Basbagill et al. 2013; Röck et al. 2018). 3D printing reduces material waste and the duration of the construction phase 
as well as labour accidents (Dixit 2019). Coupling 3D printing and robots allows for increasing productivity through fully automated 
prefabricated buildings. Drones allow for a better monitoring and inspection of construction projects through real-time comparison 
between planned and implemented solutions. Coupling drones with 3D scanning allows predicting building heights and energy 
consumption (Streltsov et  al. 2020). Sensors offer a  continuous data collection and monitoring of end-use services (i.e.,  heating, 
cooling, and lighting), thus allowing for preventive maintenance while providing more comfort to end-users. Coupling sensors with 
IoT, which connects to the internet household appliances and devices such as thermostats, enable demand-response, and flexibility to 
reduce peak loads (IEA 2017a; Lyons 2019). Overall, connected appliances offer a variety of opportunities for end-users to optimise 
their energy demand by improving the responsiveness of energy services (IEA 2017a; Nakicenovic et al. 2019) through the use of 
digital goods and services (Wilson et al., 2020) including peer-to-peer electricity trading (Morstyn et al. 2018).

Buildings  Chapter 99used in industrial facilities and in buildings with big glass envelopes. 
Masonry is a  heterogeneous material using bricks, blocks, and 
others, including the traditional stone. Composite structures are 
those involving multiple dissimilar materials. Bamboo is a traditional 
building material throughout the world tropical and sub-tropical 
regions. Rammed earth can be considered to be included in masonry 
construction, but it is a  structure very much used in developing 
countries and it is finding new interest in developed ones (Cabeza 
et al. 2021).
The literature evaluating the embodied energy in building materials 
is extensive, but that considering embodied carbon is much more 
scarce (Cabeza et al. 2021). Recently this evaluation is done using the 
methodology lifecycle assessment (LCA), but since the boundaries 
used in those studies are different, varying, for example, in the 
consideration of cradle to grave, cradle to gate, or cradle to cradle, 
the comparison is very difficult (Moncaster et al. 2019). A summary of 
the embodied energy and embodied carbon cradle to gate coefficients 
reported in the literature are found in Figure 9.9 (Alcorn and Wood 
1998; Crawford and Treolar 2010; Vukotic et al. 2010; Symons 2011; 
Moncaster and Song 2012; Cabeza et al. 2013; De Wolf et al. 2016; 
Birgisdottir et al. 2017; Pomponi and Moncaster 2016, 2018; Omrany 
et al. 2020; Cabeza et al. 2021). Steel represents the materials with 
higher embodied energy, 32–35 MJ kg–1; embodied energy in masonry 
is higher than in concrete and earth materials, but surprisingly, some 
types of wood have more embodied energy than expected; there are 
dispersion values in the literature depending on the material. On the 
other hand, earth materials and wood have the lowest embodied 
carbon, with less than 0.01 kgCO 2 per kg of material (Cabeza et al. 
2021). The concept of buildings as carbon sinks arise from the idea 
that wood stores considerable quantities of carbon with a relatively 
small ratio of carbon emissions to material volume and concrete has 
substantial embodied carbon emissions with minimal carbon storage 
capacity (Sanjuán et al. 2019; Churkina et al. 2020).
9.4.2.2 Embodied Emissions
Embodied emissions from production of materials are an important 
component of building sector emissions, and their share is 
likely to increase as emissions from building energy demand 
decrease (Röck et al. 2020). Embodied emissions trajectories can 
be lowered by limiting the amount of new floor area required 
(Berrill and Hertwich 2021; Fishman et  al. 2021), and reducing 
the quantity and  GHG intensity of materials through material 
efficiency measures such as light-weighting and improved building 
design, material substitution to lower-carbon alternatives, higher 
fabrication yields and scrap recovery during material production, 
and re-use or lifetime extension of building components (Allwood 
et al. 2011; Heeren et al. 2015; Hertwich et al. 2019; Churkina et al. 
2020; Pamenter and Myers 2021; Pauliuk et al. 2021). Reducing the 
GHG intensity of energy supply to material production activities 
also has a large influence on reducing overall embodied emissions. 
Figure  9.10 shows projections of embodied emissions to 2050 
from residential buildings in a  baseline scenario (SSP2 baseline) 
and a scenario incorporating multiple material efficiency measures 
and a much faster decarbonisation of energy supply (LED and 2°C 
policy) (Pauliuk et al. 2021). Embodied emissions are projected to be 32% lower in 2050 than 2020 in a baseline scenario, primarily 
due to a lower growth rate of building floor area per population. 
This is because the global population growth rate slows over the 
coming decades, leading to less demand for new floor area relative 
to total population. Further baseline reductions in embodied 
emissions between 2020 and 2050 derive from improvements 
in material production and a gradual decline in GHG intensity of 
energy supply. In a  LED + 2°C policy scenario, 2050 embodied 
emissions are 86% lower than the baseline. This reduction of 2050 
emissions comes from contributions of comparable magnitude 
from three sources; slower floor area growth leading to less floor 
area of new construction per  capita (sufficiency), reductions in 
the mass of materials required for each unit of newly built floor 
area (material efficiency), and reduction in the GHG intensity of 
material production, from material substitution to lower carbon 
materials, and faster transition of energy supply. 
The attribution of changes in embodied emissions to changes in the 
drivers of population, sufficiency, material efficiency, and GHG 
intensity of material production is calculated using additive log-
mean divisia index decomposition analysis (Ang and Zhang 2000). 
The decomposition of emissions into four driving factors is shown in 
Equation 9.3, where m2NC refers to floor area of new construction, 
kgMat refers to mass of materials used for new construction, and 
kgCO2e refers to embodied GHG emissions in CO 2e. The allocation of 
changes in emissions between two cases k and k–1 to changes in 
a single driving factor D  is shown in Equation 9.4. For instance, to 
calculate changes in emissions due to population growth, D  will take 
on the value of population in the two cases being compared. The 
superscript k stands for the time period and scenario of the 
emissions, for example, SSP2 baseline scenario in 2050. When 
decomposing emissions between two cases k and k–1, either the 
time period or the scenario stays constant. The decomposition is 
done for every region at the highest regional resolution available, 
and aggregation (e.g., to global level) is then done by summing over 
regions. For changes in emissions within a  scenario over time 
(e.g., SSP baseline emissions in 2020 and 2050), the decomposition 
is made for every decade, and the total 2020–2050 decomposition is 
then produced by summing decompositions of changes in emissions 
each decade.

Buildings  Chapter 999.4.3 Technological Developments Since AR5
9.4.3.1 Overview of Technological Developments
There are many technologies that can reduce energy use in buildings 
(Finnegan et  al. 2018; Kockat et  al. 2018a), and those have been 
extensively investigated. Other technologies that can contribute to 
achieving carbon zero buildings are less present in the literature. 
Common technologies available to achieve zero energy buildings 
were summarised in (Cabeza and Chàfer 2020) and are presented in 
Tables 9.SM.1 to 9.SM.3 in detail, where Figure 9.11 shows a summary.
Other opportunities exist, such as building light-weighting or more 
efficient material production, use and disposal (Hertwich et  al. 
2020), fast-growing biomass sources such as hemp, straw or flax as 
insulation in renovation processes (Pittau et al. 2019), bamboo-based 
construction systems as an alternative to conventional high-impact 
systems in tropical and subtropical climates (Zea Escamilla et al. 2018). Earth architecture is still limited to a niche (Morel and Charef 2019). 
See also Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 13 for carbon dioxide removal 
and its role in mitigation strategies.
9.4.3.2 Appliances and Lighting
Electrical appliances have a  significant contribution to household 
electricity consumption (Pothitou et  al. 2017). Ownership of 
appliances, the use of appliances, and the power demand of the 
appliances are key contributors to domestic electricity consumption 
(Jones et al. 2015). The drivers in energy use of appliances are the 
appliance type (e.g.,  refrigerators), number of households, number 
of appliances per  household, and energy used by each appliance 
(Chu and Bowman 2006; Cabeza et al. 2014; Spiliotopoulos 2019). 
At the same time, household energy-related behaviours are also 
a driver of energy use of appliances (Khosla et al. 2019) (Section 9.5). 
Although new technologies such as IoT linked to the appliances 
increase flexibility to reduce peak loads and reduce energy demand Figure 9.10 (continued): Decompositions of changes in residential embodied emissions projected by baseline scenarios for 2020–2050, and differences 
between scenarios in 2050 using two scenarios from the RECC model.  (a) Global resolution, and (b) for nine world regions. Emissions are decomposed based on 
changes in driver variables of population, sufficiency (floor area of new construction per capita), material efficiency (material production per floor area), and renewables (GHG 
emissions per unit material production). ‘Renewables’ is a summary term describing changes in GHG intensity of energy supply. Emission projections to 2050, and differences 
between scenarios in 2050, demonstrate mitigation potentials from the dimensions of the SER framework realised in each model scenario.

Chapter 9 Buildings9
(Kramer  et  al. 2020), trends show that appliances account for an 
increasing amount of building energy consumption (Figure  9.8). 
Appliances used in Developed Countries consume electricity and 
not fuels (fossil or renewable), which often have a  relatively high 
carbon footprint. The rapid increase in appliance ownership (Cabeza 
et al. 2018b) can affect the electricity grid. Moreover, energy intensity 
improvement in appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines, 
TVs, and computers has counteracted the substantial increase 
in ownership and use since the year 2000 (International Energy 
Agency 2019b).But appliances are also a significant opportunity for energy efficiency 
improvement. Research on energy efficiency of different appliances 
worldwide showed that this research focused in different time frames 
in different countries (Figure 9.12). This figure presents the number 
of occurrences of a term (the name of a studied appliance) appearing 
per year and per country, according to the references obtained from 
a  Scopus search. The figure shows that most research carried out 
was after 2010. And again, this figure shows that research is mostly 
carried out for refrigerators and for brown appliances such as smart 
phones. Moreover, the research carried out worldwide is not only 
devoted to technological aspects, but also to behavioural aspects 
and quality of service (such as digital television or smart phones).

Buildings  Chapter 99Lighting energy accounts for around 19% of global electricity 
consumption (Attia et al. 2017; Enongene et al. 2017; Baloch et al. 
2018). Many studies have reported the correlation between the 
decrease in energy consumption and the improvement of the energy 
efficiency of lighting appliances (Table 9.1). Today, the new standards 
recommend the phase out of incandescent light bulbs, linear 
fluorescent lamps, and halogen lamps and their substitution by more 
efficient technologies such as compact fluorescent lighting (CFL) and 
light-emitting diodes (LEDs) (Figure 9.8). Due to the complexity of 
these systems, simulation tools are used for the design and study 
of such systems, which can be summarised in Baloch et al. (2018).
Single-phase induction motors are extensively used in residential 
appliances and other building low-power applications. Conventional 
motors work with fixed speed regime directly fed from the grid, giving 
unsatisfactory performance (low efficiency, poor power factor, and 
poor torque pulsation). Variable speed control techniques improve 
the performance of such motors (Jannati et al. 2017).
Within the control strategies to improve energy efficiency in appliances, 
energy monitoring for energy management has been extensively 
researched. Abubakar et al. (2017) present a review of those methods. 
The paper distinguishes between intrusive load monitoring (ILM), with 
distributed sensing, and non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM), based 
on a single point sensing.
9.4.4 Case Studies
9.4.4.1 Warehouses
Warehouses are major contributors to the rise of greenhouse gas 
emissions in supply chains (Bartolini et  al. 2019). The expanding 
e-commerce sector and the growing demand for mass customisation 
have even led to an increasing need for warehouse space and buildings, 
particularly for serving the uninterrupted customer demand in the 
business-to-consumer market. Although warehouses are not specifically 
designed to provide their inhabitants with comfort because they are 
mainly unoccupied, the impact of their activities in the global GHG 
emissions is remarkable. Warehousing activities contribute roughly 
11% of the total GHG emissions generated by the logistics sector across 
the world. Following this global trend, increasing attention to green 
and sustainable warehousing processes has led to many new research 
results regarding management concepts, technologies, and equipment 
to reduce warehouses carbon footprint, that is, the total emissions of 
GHG in carbon equivalents directly caused by warehouses activities.
9.4.4.2 Historical and Heritage Buildings
Historical buildings, defined as those built before 1945, are usually 
low-performance buildings by definition from the space heating point 
of view and represent almost 30–40% of the whole building stock 
in European countries (Cabeza et  al. 2018a). Historical buildings 
often contribute to townscape character, they create the urban 
spaces that are enjoyed by residents and attract tourist visitors. They 
may be protected by law from alteration not only limited to their 
visual appearance preservation, but also concerning materials and 
construction techniques to be integrated into original architectures. On the other hand, a heritage building is a historical building which, for 
their immense value, is subject to legal preservation. The integration of 
renewable energy systems in such buildings is more challenging than 
in other buildings. In the review carried out by Cabeza et al. (2018a) 
different case studies are presented and discussed, where heat pumps, 
solar energy and geothermal energy systems are integrated in such 
buildings, after energy efficiency is considered.
9.4.4.3 Positive Energy or Energy Plus Buildings
The integration of energy generation on-site means further contribution 
of buildings towards decarbonisation (Ürge-Vorsatz  et  al.  2020). 
Integration of renewables in buildings should always come after 
maximising the reduction in the demand for energy services through 
sufficiency measures and maximising efficiency improvement to 
reduce energy consumption, but the inclusion of energy generation 
would mean a step forward to distributed energy systems with high 
contribution from buildings, becoming prosumers (Sánchez Ramos et al. 
2019). Decrease price of technologies such as photovoltaic (PV) and the 
integration of energy storage (de Gracia and Cabeza 2015) are essential 
to achieve this objective. Other technologies that could be used are 
photovoltaic/thermal (Sultan and Ervina Efzan 2018), solar/biomass 
hybrid systems (Zhang et al. 2020b), solar thermoelectric (Sarbu and 
Dorca 2018), solar powered sorption systems for cooling (Shirazi et al. 
2018), and on-site renewables with battery storage (Liu et al. 2021).
9.4.4.4 District Energy Networks
District heating networks have evolved from systems where heat was 
produced by coal or waste and storage was in the form of steam, to much 
higher energy efficiency networks with water or glycol as the energy 
carrier and fuelled by a wide range of renewable and low carbon fuels. 
Common low carbon fuels for district energy systems include biomass, 
other renewables (i.e., geothermal, PV, and large solar thermal), industry 
surplus heat or power-to-heat concepts, and heat storage including 
seasonal heat storage (Lund et al. 2018). District energy infrastructure 
opens opportunities for integration of several heat and power sources 
and is ‘future proof’ in the sense that the energy source can easily be 
converted or upgraded in the future, with heat distributed through 
the existing district energy network. Latest developments include 
the inclusion of smart control and AI (Revesz et  al. 2020), and low 
temperature thermal energy districts. Authors show carbon emissions 
reduction up to 80% compared to the use of gas boilers.
9.4.5 Low- and Net Zero-energy Buildings – 
Exemplary Buildings
Nearly zero energy (NZE) buildings or low-energy buildings are possible 
in all world relevant climate zones (Mata et al. 2020b; Ürge-Vorsatz 
et al. 2020) (Figure 9.13). Moreover, they are possible both for new 
and retrofitted buildings. Different envelope design and technologies 
are needed, depending on the climate and the building shape and 
orientation. For example, using the Passive House standard an annual 
heating and cooling energy demand decrease between 75% and 
95% compared to conventional values can be achieved. Table 9.2 lists 
several exemplary low- and NZE-buildings with some of their feature.

Buildings  Chapter 999.5 Non-technological and Behavioural 
Mitigation Options and Strategies
Non-technological (NT) measures are key for low-carbon buildings, 
but still attract less attention than technological measures (Creutzig 
et al. 2016, 2018; Ruparathna et al. 2016; Mundaca et al. 2019; Vence 
and Pereira 2019; Cabeza et al. 2020; Mata et al. 2021b). The section 
is set out to understand, over the building’s lifecycle, NT determinants 
of buildings’ energy demand and emissions (Section 9.5.1); to present 
NT climate mitigation actions (Section  9.5.2); then, to understand 
how to get these actions implemented (Section 9.5.3). The latter is 
a starting point in the design of policies (Section 9.9).
9.5.1 Non-technological Determinants of Energy 
Demand and Carbon Emissions
Buildings climate impact includes CO 2 emissions from operational 
energy use, carbon footprint, PM 2.5 concentrations and embodied 
carbon, and is unequivocally driven by GDP , income, population, 
buildings floor area, energy price, climate, behaviour, and social and 
physical environment (Wolske et al. 2020; Mata et al. 2021d).
9.5.1.1 Climate and Physical Environment
Outdoor temperature, heating and cooling degree days, sunshine 
hours, rainfall, humidity and wind are highly determinant of energy 
demand (Tol et al. 2012; Rosenberg 2014; Harold et al. 2015; Risch and 
Salmon 2017; Lindberg et al. 2019). Density, compacity, and spatial 
effects define the surrounding environment and urban microclimate. 
Urban residents usually have a relatively affluent lifestyle, but use 
less energy for heating (Niu et al. 2012; Huang 2015; Rafiee et al. 
2019; Ayoub 2019; Oh and Kim 2019). Urbanisation is discussed 
in Chapter 8.
Climate variability and extreme events may drastically increase peak 
and annual energy consumption (Hong et al. 2013; Cui et al. 2017; 
Mashhoodi et al. 2019). Climate change effects on future demand and 
emissions, are discussed in Section 9.7, and effects of temperature on 
health and productivity, in Section 9.8.
9.5.1.2 Characteristics of the Building 
Building typology and floor area (or e.g., number of bedrooms or lot 
size) are correlated to energy demand (Manzano-Agugliaro et al. 2015; 
Moura et al. 2015; Fosas et al. 2018; Morganti et al. 2019; Berrill et al. 
2021). Affluence is embedded in these variables as higher-income 
households have larger homes and lots. Residential consumption 
increases with the number of occupants but consumption per capita 
decreases proportionally to it (Serrano et al. 2017). Construction or 
renovation year has a negative correlation as recently built buildings 
must comply with increasingly strict standards (Brounen et al. 2012; 
Kavousian et  al. 2015; Österbring et  al. 2016). Only for electricity 
consumption no significant correlation is observed to building age 
(Kavousian et  al. 2013). Material choices, bioclimatic and circular 
design discussed in Section 9.4.2.9.5.1.3 Socio-demographic Factors
Income is positively correlated to energy demand (Cayla et al. 2011; 
Sreekanth et al. 2011; Couture et al. 2012; Moura et al. 2015; Singh 
et al. 2017; Yu 2017; Bissiri et al. 2019; Mata et al. 2021b). High-income 
households tend to use more efficient appliances and are likely to be 
more educated and environmentally sensitive, but their higher living 
standards require more energy (Harold et al. 2015; Hidalgo et al. 2018). 
Low-income households are in higher risk of fuel poverty (Section 9.8). 
Mixed effects are found for household size, age, gender, ethnicity, 
education levels and tenancy status (Engvall et  al. 2014; Hansen 
2016; Lévy and Belaïd 2018; Arawomo 2019; Rafiee et  al. 2019). 
Single-parent and elderly households consume more gas and 
electricity, and gender has no significant effect (Brounen et al. 2012; 
Harold et al. 2015; Huang 2015). Similarly, larger families use less 
electricity per capita (Bedir et al. 2013; Kavousian et al. 2013). Heating 
expenditure tends to be higher for owners than for renters, despite 
the formers tendency to have more efficient appliances (Gillingham 
et al. 2012; Davis, 2012; Kavousian et al. 2015).
9.5.1.4 Behaviour
Occupants presence and movement, interactions with the building, 
comfort-driven adaptations and cultural practices determine energy 
consumption (Hong et al. 2017; Yan et al. 2017; D’Oca et al. 2018; 
Khosla et al. 2019; Li et al. 2019; O’Brien et al. 2020). Households 
consume more on weekends and public holidays, and households with 
employed occupants consume less than self-employed occupants, 
probably because some of the latter jobs are in-house (Harold et al. 
2015; Hidalgo et al. 2018). Understanding and accurate modelling of 
occupant behaviour is crucial to reduce the gap between design and 
energy performance (Gunay et al. 2013; Yan et al. 2017), especially 
for more efficient buildings, which rely on passive design features, 
human-centred technologies, and occupant engagement (Grove-
Smith et al. 2018; Pitts 2017). 
9.5.2 Insights From Non-technological  
and Behavioural Interventions
A range of NT actions can substantially reduce buildings energy 
demand and emissions (Figure  9.14; see Supplementary Material 
9.SM.2 for details). The subsections below present insights on the 
variations depending on the solution, subsector, and region.
9.5.2.1 Passive and Active Design, Management, 
and Operation
Bioclimatic design and passive strategies for natural heating, cooling 
and lighting, can greatly reduce buildings’ climate impact, and avoid 
cooling in developing countries (Bienvenido-Huertas et  al. 2021, 
2020; Amirifard et  al. 2019). Design can provide additional small 
savings, for example, by placing refrigerator away from the oven, 
radiators or windows (Christidou et al. 2014). Passive management 
refers to adjustments in human behaviour such as adapted clothing, 
allocation of activities in the rooms of the building to minimise the 
Chapter 9 Buildings9
energy use (Klein et  al. 2012; Rafsanjani et  al. 2015) or manual 
operation of the building envelope (Rijal et  al. 2012; Volochovic 
et  al. 2012). Quantitative modelling of such measures is most 
common for non-residential buildings, in which adaptive behaviours 
are affected by the office space distribution and interior design, 
amount of occupants, visual comfort, outdoor view, and easy-to-use 
control mechanisms (O’Brien and Gunay 2014; Talele et  al. 2018). 
Socio-demographic factors, personal characteristics and contextual 
factors also influence occupant behaviour and their interactions with 
buildings (D’Oca et al. 2018b; Hong et al. 2020). 
Active management refers to human control of building energy 
systems. Efficient lighting practices can effectively reduce summer 
peak demand (Dixon et  al. 2015; Taniguchi et  al. 2016). On the 
contrary, the application of the daylight-saving time in the US 
increases up to 7% lighting consumption (Rakha et  al. 2018). 
Efficient cooking practices for cooking, appliance use (e.g.,  avoid 
stand-by regime, select eco-mode), or for hot water can save up 
to 25% (Peschiera and Taylor 2012; Teng et  al. 2012; Abrahamse 
and Steg 2013; Berezan et al. 2013; Hsiao et al. 2014; Dixon et al. 
2015; Reichert et al. 2016). High behavioural control is so far proven 
difficult to achieve (Ayoub et al. 2014; Sköld et al. 2018). Automated 
controls and technical measures to trigger occupant operations are 
addressed in Section 9.4.9.5.2.2 Limited Demands for Services
Adjustment in the set-point temperature in winter and summer results 
in savings between 5% and 25% (Ayoub et al. 2014; Christidou et al. 
2014; Taniguchi et al. 2016; Sun and Hong 2017). As introduced in 
Section 9.3, a series of recent works study a cap on the living area 
(Mata et  al. 2021a) or an increase in household size (Berrill et  al. 
2021). These studies are promising but of limited complexity in 
terms of rebounds, interactions with other measures, and business 
models, thus require further investigation. Professional assistance 
and training on these issues is limited (Maxwell et al. 2018).
Willingness to adopt is found for certain measures (full load to 
laundry appliances, lid on while cooking, turning lights off, defer 
electricity usage and HVAC systems, adjust set-point temperature by 
1°C) but not for others (appliances on standby, using more clothes, 
avoid leaving the TV on while doing other things, defer ovens, ironing 
or heating systems, adjust set-point temperature by 3°C, move to 
a  low energy house or smaller apartment) (Yohanis 2012; Brown 
et  al. 2013; Li et  al. 2017; Sköld et  al. 2018). A positive synergy 
with digitalisation and smart home appliances is identified, driven 
by a  combination of comfort requirements and economic interest, 
confirmed by a willingness to defer electricity usage in exchange for 
cost savings (Ferreira et al. 2018; Mata et al. 2020c).Active

Buildings  Chapter 999.5.2.3 Flexibility of Demand and Comfort Requirements
In a flexible behaviour, the desired level of service is the same, but 
it can be shifted over time, typically allowing automated control, 
for the benefit of the electricity or district heating networks. There 
are substantial economic, technical, and behavioural benefits from 
implementing flexibility measures (Mata et al. 2020c), with unknown 
social impacts.
With demand-side measures (DSM), such as shifting demand 
a  few hours, peak net demand can be reduced by up to 10–20% 
(Stötzer et al. 2015); a similar potential is available for short-term 
load shifting during evening hours (Aryandoust and Lilliestam 2017). 
Although different household types show different consumption 
patterns and thus an individual availability of DSM capacity during 
the day (Fischer et al. 2017), there is limited (Shivakumar et al. 2018) 
or inexistent (Drysdale et al. 2015; Nilsson et al. 2017) information 
of consumers’ response to time of use pricing, specifically among 
those living in apartments (Bartusch and Alvehag 2014). Behavioural 
benefits are identified in terms of increased level of energy awareness 
of the users (Rehm et al. 2018), measured deliberate attempts of the 
consumers to reduce and/or shift their electricity usage (Bradley et al. 
2016). Real-time control and behavioural change influence 40% 
of the electricity use during the operational life of non-residential 
buildings (Kamilaris et al. 2014). 
9.5.2.4 Circular and Sharing Economy (CSE)
Non-technological CSE solutions, based on the Regenerate, Share, 
Optimise, Loop, Virtualise, Exchange (ReSOLVE) framework (CE100 
2016; ARUP 2018) include sharing, virtualising and exchanging. 
These are less studied than circular materials, with notably less 
investigation of existing buildings and sharing solutions (Pomponi 
and Moncaster 2017; Høibye and Sand 2018; Kyrö 2020; European 
Commission 2020). 
The sharing economy generates an increased utilisation rate of 
products or systems by enabling or offering shared use, access 
or ownership of products and assets that have a  low ownership 
or use rate. Measures include conditioned spaces (accommodation, 
facility rooms, offices) as well as tools and transfer of ownership 
(i.e., second-hand or donation) (Rademaekers et al. 2017; Mercado 
2018; Hertwich et al. 2020; Cantzler et al. 2020; Harris et al. 2021; 
Mata et al. 2021a). The evidence on the link between user behaviour 
and net environmental impacts of sharing options is still limited 
(Laurenti et al. 2019; Mata et al. 2020a; Harris et al. 2021) and even 
begins to be questioned, due to rebounds that partially or fully offset 
the benefits (Agrawal and Bellos 2017; Zink and Geyer 2017). For 
example, the costs savings from reduced ownership can be allocated 
to activities with a  higher carbon intensity, or result in increased 
mobility. Both reduced ownership and other circular consumption 
habits show no influence on material footprint, other than mildly 
positive influence in low-income households (Junnila et  al. 2018; 
Ottelin et al. 2020).9.5.2.5 Value-chain, Social and Institutional Innovations
Cooperative efforts are necessary to improve buildings energy 
efficiency (Masuda and Claridge 2014; Kamilaris et  al. 2014; 
Ruparathna et al. 2016). For instance, interdisciplinary understanding 
of organisational culture, occupant behaviour, and technology 
adoption is required to set up occupancy/operation best practises 
(Janda 2014). Similarly, close collaboration of all actors along the 
value chain can reduce by 50% emissions from concrete use (Habert 
et al. 2020); such collaboration can be enhanced in a construction 
project by transforming the project organisation and delivery contract 
to reduce costs and environmental impact (Hall and Bonanomi 
2021). Building commissioning helps to reduce energy consumption 
by streamlining the systems, but benefits may not persist. Energy 
communities are discussed later in the chapter. 
NT challenges include training and software costs (tailored learning 
programs, learning-by-doing, human capital mobilisation), client and 
market demand (service specification, design and provision, market 
and financial analysis) and legal issues (volatile energy prices, meeting 
regulation); and partnership, governance and commercialisation. 
These challenges are identified for Building Information Modelling 
(BIM) (Oduyemi et  al. 2017; Rahman and Ayer 2019), PV industry 
(Triana et al. 2018), smart living (Solaimani et al. 2015) or circular 
economy (Vence and Pereira 2019). 
9.5.3 Adoption of Climate Mitigation Solutions – 
Reasons and Willingness
Mixed effects are found for technical issues, attitudes, and values 
(Table 9.3). In spite of proven positive environmental attitudes and 
willingness to adopt mitigation solutions, these are outweighed by 
financial aspects all over the world (Mata et  al. 2021b). Adopters 
in Developed Countries are more sensitive towards financial issues 
and comfort disruptions; whereas in other world regions techno-
economic concerns prevail. Private consumers seem ready to support 
stronger governmental action, whereas non-private interventions are 
hindered by constraints in budgets and profits, institutional barriers 
and complexities (Curtis et al. 2017; Zuhaib et al. 2017; Tsoka et al. 
2018; Kim et al. 2019).
A variety of interventions targeted to heterogeneous consumer 
groups and decision makers is needed to fulfil their diverse needs 
(Zhang et al. 2012; Haines and Mitchell 2014; Gram-Hanssen 2014; 
Marshall et  al. 2015; Friege et  al. 2016; Hache et  al. 2017; Liang 
et al. 2017; Ketchman et al. 2018; Soland et al. 2018). Policy reviews 
for specific market segments and empirical studies investigating 
investment decisions would benefit from a multidisciplinary approach 
to energy consumption patterns and market maturity (Boyd 2016; 
Heiskanen and Matschoss 2017; Baumhof et al. 2018; Marzano et al. 
2018; Wilson et al. 2018).

Buildings  Chapter 999.5.3.1 Building Envelope
In North America and Europe, personal attitudes, values, and 
existing information and support are the most and equally important 
reasons for improving the building envelope. Consumers have some 
economic concerns and little technical concerns, the latter related to 
the performance and maintenance of the installed solutions (Mata 
et al. 2021a). In other world regions or climate zones the literature 
is limited.
Motivations are often triggered by urgent comfort or replacement 
needs. Maintaining the aesthetic value may as well hinder the 
installation of insulation if no technical solutions are easily available 
(Haines and Mitchell 2014; Bright et al. 2019). Local professionals 
and practitioners can both encourage (Friege 2016; Ozarisoy and 
Altan 2017) and discourage the installation of insulation, according 
to their knowledge and training (Curtis et al. 2017; Zuhaib et al. 2017; 
Maxwell et al. 2018; Tsoka et al. 2018). If energy renovations of the 
buildings envelopes are not normative, cooperative ownership may 
be a  barrier in apartment buildings (Miezis et  al. 2016). Similarly, 
product information and labelling may be helpful or overwhelming 
(Ozarisoy and Altan 2017; Lilley et  al. 2017; Bright et  al. 2019). 
Decisions are correlated to governmental support (Swantje et  al. 
2015; Tam et  al. 2016) and peer information (Friege et  al. 2016; 
Friege 2016).
The intervention is required to be cost efficient, although value could 
be placed in the amount of energy saved (Mortensen et  al. 2016; 
Lilley et al. 2017; Howarth and Roberts 2018; Kim et al. 2019) or the 
short payback period (Miezis et al. 2016). Subsidies have a positive 
effect (Swan et al. 2017).
9.5.3.2 Adoption of Efficient HVAC Systems and Appliances
Mixed willingness is found to adopt efficient technologies. While 
Developed Countries are positive towards building envelope 
technologies, appliances such as A-rated equipment or condensing 
boilers are negatively perceived (Yohanis 2012). In contrast, adopters 
in Asia are positive towards energy-saving appliances (Liao et  al. 
2020; Spandagos et al. 2020).
Comfort, economic and ecological aspects, as well as information 
influence the purchase of a  heating system (Claudy et  al. 2011; 
Decker and Menrad 2015). Information and support from different 
stakeholders are the most relevant aspects in different geographical 
contexts (Hernandez-Roman et al. 2017; Tumbaz and Moğulkoç 2018; 
Curtis et al. 2018; Bright et al. 2019; Chu and Wang 2019). 
Among high-income countries, economy aspects have positive 
effects, specially reductions in energy bills and financial incentives 
or subsidies (Chun and Jiang 2013; Christidou et al. 2014; Mortensen 
et  al. 2016; Clancy et  al. 2017; Ketchman et  al. 2018). Having 
complementary technologies already in place also has positively 
affects adoption (Zografakis et  al. 2012; Clancy et  al. 2017), but 
performance and maintenance concerns appear as barriers (Qiu et al. 
2014). The solutions are positively perceived as high-technology 
innovative, to enhance status, and are supported by peers and own-environmental values (Mortensen et  al. 2016; Heiskanen and 
Matschoss 2017; Ketchman et al. 2018). 
9.5.3.3 Installation of Renewable Energy Sources (RES)
Although consumers are willing to install distributed RES worldwide, 
and information has successfully supported their roll out, economic 
and governmental support is still necessary for their full deployment. 
Technical issues remain for either very novel technologies or for 
the integration of RES in the energy system (Ürge-Vorsatz et  al. 
2020; Mata et al. 2021a). Capacities are to be built by coordinated 
actions by all stakeholders (Musonye et al. 2020). To this aim, energy 
communities and demonstrative interventions at local scale are key 
to address technical, financial, regulatory and structural barriers and 
document long-term benefits (von Wirth et al. 2018; Shafique et al. 
2020; Fouladvand et al. 2020).
Regarding solar technologies, heterogeneous decisions are formed 
by socio-demographic, economic and technical predictors interwoven 
with a variety of behavioural traits (Alipour et al. 2020; Khan 2020). 
Studies on PV adoption confirm place-specific (various spatial 
and peer effects), multi-scalar cultural dynamics (Bollinger and 
Gillingham 2012; Schaffer and Brun 2015; Graziano and Gillingham 
2015). Environmental concern and technophilia drive the earliest PV 
adopters, while later adopters value economic gains (Hampton and 
Eckermann 2013; Jager-Waldau et al. 2018; Abreu et al. 2019; Palm 
2020). Previous experience with similar solutions increases adoption 
(Baumhof et al. 2018; Qurashi and Ahmed 2019; Bach et al. 2020; 
Reindl and Palm 2020). 
9.5.3.4 Low-carbon Materials
Studies on low-carbon materials tend to focus on wood-based 
building systems and prefabricated housing construction, mostly 
in high-income countries, as many sustainable managed forestries 
and factories for prefabricated housing concentrated in such regions 
(Mata et al. 2021a). This uneven promotion of wood can lead to its 
overconsumption (Pomponi et al. 2020). 
Although the solutions are not yet implemented at scale, examples 
include the adoption of low carbon cement in Cuba motivated by the 
possibility of supplying the rising demand with low initial investment 
costs (Cancio Díaz et al. 2017) or adoption of bamboo-based social 
houses in The Philippines motivated by local job creation and typhoon 
resistance (Zea Escamilla et al. 2016). More generally, low investment 
costs and high level decision-making, for example, political will and 
environmental values of society, increase the adoption rate of low-
carbon materials (Steinhardt and Manley 2016; Lien and Lolli 2019; 
Hertwich et al. 2020). In contrast, observed barriers include lobbying 
by traditional materials industries, short-term political decision 
making (Tozer 2019) and concerns over technical performance, risk 
of damage, and limited alternatives available (Thomas et al. 2014). 
9.5.3.5 Digitalisation and Demand-supply Flexibility
Demand-supply flexibility measures are experimentally being adopted 
in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific Developed  regions. 
Chapter 9 Buildings9Changes  in the current regulatory framework would facilitate 
participation based on trust and transparent communication 
(Wolsink 2012; Nyborg and Røpke 2013; Mata et al. 2020b). However, 
consumers expect governments and energy utilities to steer the 
transition (Seidl et al. 2019).
Economic challenges are observed, as unclear business models, 
disadvantageous market models and high costs of advanced smart 
metering. Technical challenges include constraints for HPs and 
seasonality of space heating demands. Social challenges relate to lack 
of awareness of real-time price information and inadequate technical 
understanding. Consumers lack acceptance towards comfort changes 
(noise, overnight heating) and increased automation (Drysdale et al. 
2015; Bradley et  al. 2016; Sweetnam et  al. 2019). Risks identified 
include higher peaks and congestions in low price-hours, difficulties 
in designing electricity tariffs because of conflicts with CO 2 intensity, 
and potential instability in the entire electricity system caused by 
tariffs coupling to wholesale electricity pricing.
Emerging market players are changing customer utility relationships, 
as the grid is challenged with intermittent loads and integration 
needs for ICTs, interfering with consumers requirements of autonomy 
and privacy (Wolsink 2012; Parag and Sovacool 2016). Although 
most private PV owners would make their storage system available 
as balancing load for the grid operator, the acquisition of new 
batteries by a majority of consumers requires incentives (Gährs et al. 
2015). For distributed energy hubs, social acceptance depends on the 
amount of local benefits in economic, environmental or social terms 
(Kalkbrenner and Roosen 2015), and increases around demonstration 
projects (von Wirth et al. 2018).
9.5.3.6 Circular and Sharing Economy
The circular and sharing economy begins to be perceived as 
organisational and technologically innovative, with the potential 
to provide superior customer value, response to societal trends and 
positive marketing (Mercado 2018; Cantzler et  al. 2020; Nußholz 
et  al. 2020). Although technical and regulatory challenges remain, 
there are key difficulties around the demonstration of a business case 
for both consumers and the supply chain (Pomponi and Moncaster 
2017; Hart et al. 2019).
Government support is needed as an initiator but also to reinforce 
building retrofit targets, promote more stringent energy and material 
standards for new constructions, and protect consumer interests 
(Hongping 2017; Fischer and Pascucci 2017; Patwa et al. 2020). Taxes 
clearly incentivise waste reduction and recycling (Rachel and Travis 
2011; Ajayi et  al. 2015; Volk et  al. 2019). In developing countries, 
broader, international, market boundaries can allow for a  more 
attractive business model (Mohit et al. 2020). Participative and new 
ownership models can favour the adoption of prefabricated buildings 
(Steinhardt and Manley 2016). Needs for improvements are observed, 
in terms of design for flexibility and deconstruction, procurement 
and prefabrication and off-site construction, standardisation and 
dimensional coordination, with differences among solutions (Osmani 
2012; Coehlo et al.2013; Lu and Yuan 2013; Cossu and Williams 2015; 
Schiller et al. 2015, 2017; Ajayi et al. 2017; Bakshan et al. 2017).Although training is a basic requirement, attitude, past experience, 
and social pressure can also be highly relevant, as illustrated for 
waste management in a survey to construction site workers (Amal 
et  al. 2017). Traditional community practices of reuse of building 
elements are observed to be replaced by a culture of waste (Ajayi 
et al. 2015; Hongping 2017).
9.6 Global and Regional Mitigation 
Potentials and Costs
9.6.1 Review of Literature Calculating Potentials 
for Different World Countries
Section  9.4 provides an update on technological options and 
practices, which allow constructing and retrofitting individual 
buildings to produce very low emissions during their operation 
phase. Since AR5, the world has seen a  growing number of such 
buildings in all populated continents, and a  growing amount of 
literature calculates the mitigation potential for different countries 
if such technologies and practices penetrate at scale. Figure  9.15 
synthesises the results of sixty-seven bottom-up studies, which 
rely on the bottom-up technology-reach approach and assess the 
potential of such technologies and practices, aggregated to stock of 
corresponding products and/or buildings at national level. 
The studies presented in Figure  9.15 rely on all, the combination, 
or either of the following mitigation strategies: the construction 
of new high energy-performance buildings taking the advantage of 
building design, forms, and passive construction methods; the thermal 
efficiency improvement of building envelopes of the existing stock; the 
installation of advanced HVAC systems, equipment and appliances; 
the exchange of lights, appliances, and office equipment, including 
ICT, water heating, and cooking with their efficient options; demand-
side management, most often controlling comfort requirements and 
demand-side flexibility and digitalisation; as well as onsite production 
and use of renewable energy. Nearly all studies, which assess 
the technological potential assume such usage of space heating, 
cooling, water heating, and lighting that does not exceed health, 
living, and working standards, thus realising at least a  part of the 
non-technological potential, as presented in Figure 9.14. The results 
presented in Figure  9.15 relate to measures applied within the 
boundaries of the building sector, including the reduction in direct and 
indirect emissions. The results exclude the impact of decarbonisation 
measures applied within the boundaries of the energy supply sector, 
that is, the decarbonisation of grid electricity and district heat. 
The analysis of Figure  9.15 illustrates that there is a  large body of 
literature attesting to mitigation potential in the countries of Europe 
and North America of up to 55–85% and in Asia-Pacific Developed of 
up to 45% in 2050, as compared to their sector baseline emissions, 
even though they sometimes decline. For developing countries, 
the literature estimates the potential of up to 40–80% in 2050, as 
compared to their sharply growing baselines. The interpretation 
of these estimates should be cautious because the studies rely 
on assumptions with uncertainties and feasibility constrains (see 
Sections 9.6.4, Figure 9.20 and Supplementary Material Table 9.SM.6). 
Buildings  Chapter 99
The novelty since AR5 is emerging bottom-up literature, which 
attempts to account for potential at national and global level from 
applying the sufficiency approach (see Box  9.1 in Section  9.1 and 
decomposition analysis in Section  9.3.2). In spite of the reducing 
energy use per unit of floor area at an average rate of 1.3% per year, 
the growth of floor area at an average rate of 3% per year causes 
rising energy demand and GHG emissions because each new square 
meter must be served with thermal comfort and/or other amenities 
(International Energy Agency 2017; Ellsworth-Krebs 2020). Nearly all 
studies reviewed in Figure 9.15 assume the further growth of floor 
area per capita until 2050, with many studies of developing countries 
targeting today per capita floor area as in Europe.
Table  9.4 reviews the bottom-up literature, which quantifies the 
potential from reorganisation of human activities, efficient design, 
planning, and use of building space, higher density of building 
and settlement inhabitancy, redefining and downsizing goods and 
equipment, limiting their use to health, living, and working standards, 
and their sharing, recognising the number of square meters and 
devices as a determinant of GHG emissions that could be impacted via policies and measures. Nearly all national or regional studies 
originate from Europe and North America recognising challenges, 
Developed Countries face toward decarbonisation. Thus, Goldstein 
et  al. (2020) suggested prioritising the reduction in floor space of 
wealthier population and more efficient space planning because grid 
decarbonisation is not enough to meet the U.S. target by 2050 whereas 
affluent suburbs may have 15 times higher emission footprints than 
nearby neighbourhoods. Cabrera Serrenho et  al. (2019) argue that 
reducing the UK floor area is a  low cost mitigation option given 
a low building replacement rate and unreasonably high retrofit costs 
of existing buildings. Lorek and Spangenberg (2019) discusses the 
opportunity of reducing building emissions in Germany fitting better 
the structure of the dwelling stock to the declined average household 
size, as most dwellings have 3–4 rooms while most households have 
only one person. 
Whereas these studies suggest sufficiency as an important option for 
Developed Countries, global studies argue that it is also important 
for the developing world. This is because it provides the means to 
address inequality, poverty reduction and social inclusion, ensuring 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100%Mitigation Potential [%]

the provision of acceptable living standards for the entire global 
population given the planetary boundaries. As Figure 9.6 illustrates, 
the largest share of current construction occurs in developing 
countries, while these countries follow a similar demographic track 
of declining household sizes versus increasing dwelling areas. This 
trajectory translates into the importance of their awareness of the 
likely similar forthcoming challenges, and the need in early efficient 
planning of infrastructure and buildings with a focus on space usage 
and density.
9.6.2 Assessment of the Potentials at Regional 
and Global Level
This section presents an aggregation of bottom-up potential 
estimates for different countries into regional and then global 
figures for 2050, based on literature presented in Section  9.6.1. 
First, national potential estimates reported as a  share of baseline 
emissions in 2050 were aggregated into regional potential estimates. 
Second, the latter were multiplied with regional baseline emissions 
to calculate the regional potential in absolute numbers. Third, the 
global potential in absolute numbers was calculated as a  sum of regional absolute potentials. When several bottom-up studies were 
identified for a region, either a rounded average or a rounded median 
figure was taken, giving the preference to the one that was closest 
to the potential estimates of countries with very large contribution to 
regional baseline emissions in 2050 (e.g., to China in Eastern Asia). 
Furthermore, we preferred studies, which assessed the whole or 
a large share of sector emissions and considered a comprehensive 
set of measures. The regional baseline emissions, refer to the World 
Energy Outlook (WEO) Current Policy Scenario (International Energy 
Agency 2019c). The sector mitigation potential reported in Chapter 12 
for the year 2030 was estimated in the same manner. 
Figure 9.16 presents the mitigation potential in the building sector 
for the world and each region in 2050, estimated as a  result of 
this aggregation exercise. The potentials presented in the figure 
are different from those reported in Section  9.3.3, where they are 
estimated by IEA and IMAGE hybrid model. The figure provides 
two breakdowns of the potential, into the reduction of direct and 
indirect emissions as well as into the reduction of emissions from 
introducing sufficiency, energy efficiency, and renewable energy 
measures. The potential estimates rely on the incremental stepwise 
approach, assembling the measures according to the SER framework Table 9.4 | Potential GHG emission reduction in the building sector offered by the introduction of sufficiency as a main or additional measure, as 
reported by bottom-up (or hybrid) literature.

down by measure (sufficiency/energy efficiency/renewable energy) and by emission source (direct/indirect). Note: the baseline refers to the WEO Current Policy 
Scenario (International Energy Agency 2019c). It may differ from other chapters.
Chapter 9 Buildings9(Box 9.1) and correcting the amount of the potential at each step for 
the interaction of measures. The sequence of energy efficiency and 
renewable energy measures follow the conclusion of the IPCC Special 
Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5) (Rogelj et al. 2018) that 
lower energy demand allows more choice of low-carbon energy 
supply options, and therefore such sequencing is more beneficial and 
cost-effective.
Figure 9.16 argues that it is possible to mitigate 8.2 GtCO 2 or 61% 
of global building emissions in 2050, as compared to their baseline. 
At least 1.4 GtCO 2 or 10% of baseline emissions could be avoided 
introducing the sufficiency approaches. Further 5.6 GtCO 2 or 42% 
of baseline emissions could be mitigated with the help of energy 
efficiency technologies and practices. Finally, at least 1.1 GtCO 2 or 
9% of baseline emissions could be reduced through the production 
and use of onsite renewable energy. Out of the total potential, the 
largest share of 5.4 GtCO 2 will be available in developing countries; 
these countries will be able to reduce 59% of their baseline emissions. 
Developed Countries will be able to mitigate 2.7 GtCO 2 or 65% of 
their baseline emissions. Only few potential studies, often with only 
few mitigation options assessed, were available for the countries of 
South-East Asia and Pacific, Africa, and Latin America and Caribbean; 
therefore, the potential estimates represent low estimates, and the 
real potentials are likely be higher.
9.6.3 Assessment of the Potential Costs
The novelty since AR5 is that a growing number of bottom-up studies 
considers the measures as an integrated package recognising their 
technological complementarity and interdependence, rather than 
the linear process of designing and constructing buildings and 
their systems, or incremental improvements of individual building 
components and energy-using devices during building retrofits, 
losing opportunities for the optimisation of whole buildings. 
Therefore, integrated measures rather than the individual measures 
are considered for the estimates of costs and potentials. Figure 9.17 
presents the indicative breakdown of the potential reported in 
Figure 9.16 by measure and cost, to the extent that it was possible 
to disaggregate and align to common characteristics. Whereas the 
breakdown per measure was solely based on the literature reviewed 
in Section  9.6.1, the cost estimates additionally relied on the 
literature presented in this section, Figure 9.20, and Supplementary 
Material Table  9.SM.6. The literature reviewed reports fragmented 
and sometimes contradicting cost-effectiveness information. 
Despite a large number of exemplary buildings achieving very high 
performance in all parts of the world, there is a lack of mainstream 
literature or official studies assessing the costs of these buildings at 
scale (Lovins 2018; Ürge-Vorsatz et al. 2020).
Figure  9.17 indicates that a  very large share of the potential in 
Developed Countries could be realised through the introduction 
of sufficiency measures (at least 18% of their baseline emissions). 
Literature identifies many opportunities, which may help 
operationalise it. These are reorganisation of human activities, 
teleworking, coworking, more efficient space design, planning and 
use, higher density of building and settlement inhabitancy, flexible space, housing swaps, shared homes and facilities, space and room 
renting, and others (Bierwirth and Thomas 2019a; Ivanova and Büchs 
2020; Ellsworth-Krebs 2020). Whereas literature does not provide 
a  robust cost assessment of the sufficiency potential, it indicates 
that these measures are likely to be at no or very little cost (Cabrera 
Serrenho et al. 2019).
The exchange of lights, appliances, and office equipment, including 
ICT, water heating, and cooking technologies could reduce more than 
8% and 13% of the total sector baseline emissions in developed 
and developing countries respectively, typically at negative cost 
(Department of Environmental Affairs 2014; de Melo and de Martino 
Jannuzzi 2015; Prada-Hernández et  al. 2015; Subramanyam et  al. 
2017a,b; González-Mahecha et  al. 2019; Grande-Acosta and Islas-
Samperio 2020). This cost-effectiveness is, however, often reduced 
by a larger size of appliances and advanced features, which offset 
a share of positive economic effects (Molenbroek et al. 2015). 
Advanced HVAC technologies backed-up with demand-side 
management, and onsite integrated renewables backed-up with 
demand-side flexibility and digitalisation measures are typically a part 
of the retrofit or construction strategy. Among HVAC technologies, 
heat pumps are very often modelled to become a  central heating 
and cooling technology supplied with renewable electricity. The 
estimates of HVAC cost-effectiveness, including heat pumps, vary in 
modelling results from very cost-effective to medium (Department of 
Environmental Affairs 2014; Prada-Hernández et al. 2015; Akander 
et al. 2017; Hirvonen et al. 2020). Among demand-side management, 
demand-side flexibility and digitalisation options, various sensors, 
controls, and energy consumption feedback devices have typically 
negative costs, whereas advanced smart management systems as 
well as thermal and electric storages linked to fluctuating renewables 
are not yet cost-effective (Nguyen et al. 2015; Prada-Hernández et al. 
2015; Huang et al. 2019; Uchman 2021; Duman et al. 2021; Sharda 
et al. 2021; Rashid et al. 2021). Several Developed Countries achieved 
to make onsite renewable energy production and use profitable for at 
least a part of the building stock (Horváth et al. 2016; Akander et al. 
2017; Vimpari and Junnila 2019; Fina et al. 2020), but this is not yet 
the case for developing countries (Kwag et al. 2019; Cruz et al. 2020; 
Grande-Acosta and Islas-Samperio 2020). Due to characteristics 
and parameters of different building types, accommodating the 
cost-optimal renewables at large scale is especially difficult in non-
residential buildings and in urban areas, as compared to residential 
buildings and rural areas (Horváth et al. 2016; Fina et al. 2020). 
Literature agrees that new advanced buildings, using design, form, 
and passive building construction equipped with demand-side 
measures, and advanced HVAC technologies can reduce the sector 
total baseline emissions in developed and developing countries by 
at least 10% and 25% in 2050, respectively, and renewable energy 
technologies backed-up with demand-side flexibility and digitalisation 
measures typically installed in new buildings could further reduce 
these emissions by at least 11% and 7% (see also Cross-Chapter 
Box  12 in Chapter  16). The literature, however, provides different 
and sometimes conflicting information of their cost-effectiveness. 
Esser et  al. (2019) reported that by 2016, the perceived share of 
buildings similar or close to NZEB in the new construction was just 
Buildings  Chapter 99
above 20% across the EU. In this region, additional investment costs 
were no higher than 15%, as reported for Germany, Italy, Denmark, 
and Slovenia (Erhorn-Kluttig et al. 2019). Still, the European market 
experiences challenges which relate to capacity and readiness, as 
revealed by the Architects’ Council of Europe (ACE) (2019), which 
records a  decline in the share of architects who are designing 
buildings to NZEB standards to more than 50% of their time, from 
14% in 2016 to 11% in 2018. In contrast, the APEC countries reported 
additional investment costs of 67% on average (Xu and Zhang 2017) 
that makes them a key barrier to the NZEB penetration in developing countries as of today (Feng et al. 2019). This calls for additional R&D 
policies and financial incentives to reduce the NZEB costs (Xu and 
Zhang 2017; Kwag et al. 2019).
Thermal efficiency retrofits of existing envelopes followed up by 
the exchange of HVAC backed up with demand-side measures 
could reduce the sector total baseline emissions in developed and 
developing countries by at least 18% and 7% respectively in 2050. 
There have been many individual examples of deep building retrofits, 
which incremental costs are not significantly higher than those of 61112252283

Chapter 9 Buildings9shallow retrofits. However, the literature tends to agree that cost-
effective or low cost deep retrofits are not universally applicable 
for all cases, especially in historically urban areas, indicating a large 
share of the potential in the high-cost category (Department of 
Environmental Affairs 2014; Akander et al. 2017; Paduos and Corrado 
2017; Semprini et al. 2017; Subramanyam et al. 2017b; Streicher et al. 
2017; Mata et al. 2019). Achieving deep retrofits assumes additional 
measures on the top of business-as-usual retrofits, therefore high 
rate of deep retrofits at acceptable costs are not possible in case of 
low business-as-usual rates (Streicher et al. 2020). 
For a  few studies, which conducted an assessment of the sector 
transformation aiming at emission reduction of 50–80% in 2050 
versus their baseline, the incremental investment need over the 
modelling period is estimated at 0.4–3.3% of the country annual 
GDP of the scenario first year (Markewitz et  al. 2015; Bashmakov 
2017; Novikova et  al. 2018c; Kotzur et  al. 2020). These estimates 
represent strictly the incremental share of capital expenditure 
and sometimes installation costs. Therefore, these figures are not 
comparable with investment tracked against the regional or national 
sustainable finance taxonomies, as recently developed in the EU 
(European Parliament and the Council 2020), Russia (Government of 
Russian Federation 2021), South Africa (National Treasury of Republic 
of South Africa 2021), and others, or the growing literature on 
calculating the recent finance flows (Novikova et al. 2019; Valentova 
et al. 2019; Kamenders et al. 2019; Macquarie et al. 2020; Hainaut 
et al. 2021), because they are measured against other methodologies, 
which are not comparable with the methodologies used to derive the 
incremental costs by integrated assessment models and bottom-up 
studies. Therefore, the gap between the investment need and recent 
investment flows is likely to be higher, than often reported.
9.6.4 Determinants of the Potentials and Costs
The fact that the largest share of the global flow area is still to be built 
offers a large potential for emission reduction that is, however, only 
feasible if ambitious building energy codes will be applied to this new 
stock (see Section 9.9.3 on building codes). The highest demand for 
additional floor area will occur in developing countries; the building 
replacement is also the highest in developing countries because 
their building lifetime could be as short as 30 years (Lixuan et  al. 
2016; Alaidroos and Krarti 2015). Whereas as of 2018, 73 countries 
had already had building codes or were developing them, only 41 had 
mandatory residential codes and 51 had mandatory non-residential 
codes (Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction et al. 2019). 
Therefore, the feasibility of capturing this potential is a  subject to 
greater coverage, adoption, and strength of building codes.
Low rates of building retrofits are the major feasibility constraint 
of building decarbonisation in Developed Countries. Long building 
lifetime and their slow replacement caused a lock-in of low energy 
performance in old buildings of Developed Countries, especially in 
urban areas. A few studies of developing countries, mostly medium 
and high-income, also considered building retrofits (Prada-Hernández 
et al. 2015; Yu et al. 2018b; Zhou et al. 2018; Krarti 2019; Kamal et al. 
2019). The studies in Developed Countries tend to rely on either of the strategies: very ‘deep’ envelope retrofits followed by the exchange 
of HVAC with various advanced alternatives (Csoknyai et al. 2016; 
Novikova et al. 2018c,b; Duscha et al. 2019; Filippi Oberegger et al. 
2020) or more shallow retrofits followed by switching to low-carbon 
district heating or by the exchange of current HVAC with heat pumps 
linked to onsite renewables backed up energy storages (Yeh et  al. 
2016; Kotzur et  al. 2020; Hirvonen et  al. 2020). The factors, which 
impact the feasibility of these strategies, therefore, are the building 
retrofit rates and replacement rates of building systems. To achieve 
the building stock decarbonisation by 2050, most studies reviewed 
in Figure 9.16 assume ‘deep’ retrofit rates between 2.5% and 5%, 
and even 10% per  annum. Esser et  al. (2019) reported that the 
annual renovation rate in EU-28 is around 0.2%, with relatively small 
variation across individual EU member states. Sandberg et al. (2016) 
simulated retrofit rates in eleven European countries and concluded 
that only minor future increases in the renovation rates of 0.6–1.6% 
could be expected. Therefore, without strong policies supporting 
these renovations, the feasibility to achieve such high ‘deep’ retrofit 
rates is low. 
Among key factors affecting the costs-effectiveness of achieving 
high-performance buildings remain low energy prices in many 
countries worldwide (Alaidroos and Krarti 2015; Akander et al. 2017) 
and high discount rates reflecting low access to capital and high 
barriers. Copiello et al. (2017) found that the discount rate affects the 
economic results of retrofits four times higher than the energy price, 
and therefore the reduction in upfront costs and working out barriers 
are the feasibility enablers.
The good news is that literature expects a significant cost reduction 
for many technologies, which are relevant for the construction of 
high energy-performance buildings and deep retrofits. Applying 
a  technology learning curve to the data available for Europe and 
reviewing dozens of studies available, Köhler et al. (2018) estimated 
the cost reduction potential of biomass boilers, heat pumps, 
ventilation, air conditioning, thermal storages, electricity storages, 
solar PVs and solar thermal systems of 14%, 20%, 46–52%, 29%, 
29%, 65%, 57%, and 43% respectively in 2050; no significant cost 
reduction potential was found, however, for established and wide-
spread insulation technologies. More investment into Research, 
Development and Demonstration (RD&D) to reduce the technology 
costs and more financial incentives to encourage uptake of the 
technologies would allow moving along this learning curve. 
Furthermore, some literature argues that the key to cost-effectiveness 
is not necessarily a reduction in costs of technologies, but a know-
how and skills of their choosing, combining, sequencing, and timing 
to take the most benefits of their interdependence, complementarity, 
and synergy as illustrated by many examples (Lovins 2018; Ürge-
Vorsatz et  al. 2020). However, the scenarios reviewed lack such 
approaches in their cost assessments. Few indicative examples of cost 
reduction at scale were provided though not by the scenario literature, 
but case studies of the application of One-Stop Shop (OSS) approach 
at scale (Section 9.9.4). In 2013, the Dutch Energiesprong network 
brokered a  deal between Dutch building contractors and housing 
associations to reduce the average retrofit costs from EUR130,000 
down to EUR65,000 for 111,000 homes with building prefabrication 
Buildings  Chapter 99systems and project delivery models while targeting energy savings 
of 45–80% (Ürge-Vorsatz et al. 2020); out of which 10,000 retrofits 
have been realised by 2020. The French Observatory of Low Energy 
Buildings reported to achieve the cost-effective deep renovations of 

absolute primary energy consumption to achieve after renovation 
and a  cap for the budget to deliver it. The cost-effectiveness was, 
however, calculated with grants and public subsidies (Saheb 2018). 
The literature emphasises the critical role of the time between in 

Roscini et al. 2020). To set the sector at the pathway to realise its 
whole mitigation potential, it is critical to exponentially accelerate 
the learning of this know-how and skills to reduce the costs and 
remove feasibility constraints to enable the penetration of advanced 
technologies at speed that the world has not seen before. The World 
Energy Outlook (IEA 2020c) shown in the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 
Scenario (Box 9.2) the challenges and commitments the sector will 
have to address by 2030. These include bringing new buildings and 
existing buildings to near zero, with a half of existing buildings in 
Developed Countries and a third of existing buildings in developing 
countries being retrofitted by 2030. These also mean banning the 
sale of new fossil fuel-fired boilers, as well as making heat pumps 
and very efficient appliances standard technologies. The Net Zero 
Emissions by 2050 Scenario achieves almost fully to decarbonise 
the sector by 2050, with such commitments reflected neither in 
the planning and modelling efforts (Section  9.9) nor in policies 
and commitments (Section  9.9) of most world countries, with the 
countries of South-East Asia and Pacific, Southern Asia, Africa, and 
Latin America and Caribbean having the least research. 
As discussed in Section  9.6.1, the alternative and low-cost 
opportunity to reduce the sector emissions in the countries with high 
floor area per capita and the low stock turnover is offered by the 
introduction of the sufficiency approach. Section  9.9.3.1 discusses 
a range of policy instruments, which could support the realisation of 
the sufficiency potential. As the approach is new, the literature does 
not yet report experiences of these measures. In the framework of 
project OptiWohn, the German cities of Göttingen, Köln und Tübingen 
just started testing the sufficiency approach and policy measures 
for sufficiency (Stadt Göttingen 2020). Therefore, the feasibility 
of realising the sufficiency potential depends on its recognition by 
the energy and climate policy and the introduction of supporting 
measures (Samadi et al. 2017; Ellsworth-Krebs 2020; Goldstein et al. 
2020). More research is needed to understand which measures will 
work and which will not. 
Similar to buildings, the energy consumption and associated 
emissions of appliances and equipment is driven by the replacement 
of old appliances and the additional stock due to the increase 
in penetration and saturation of appliances. The feasibility of 
appliance stock replacement with efficient options is higher than 
the feasibility of building stock replacement or retrofit due to their 
smaller size, shorter lifetime, and cheaper costs (Chu and Bowman 
2006; Spiliotopoulos 2019). Some literature argues that once 
appliances achieve a  particular level of efficiency their exchange 
does not bring benefits from the resource efficiency point of view (Hertwich et al. 2019). Even through the data records a permanent 
energy efficiency improvement of individual devices (Figure  9.12), 
their growing offsets energy savings delivered by this improvement. 
The emerging literature suggests addressing the growing number of 
energy services and devices as a part of climate and energy policy 
(Bierwirth and Thomas 2019b). Section 9.5.2.2 describes measures 
for limiting demand for these services and Section 9.5.3.6 addresses 
reducing the number of technologies through their ownership and 
use patterns. (Grubler et al. 2018) also suggested redefining energy 
services and aggregating appliances, illustrating the reduction of 
energy demand by a  factor of 30 to substitute over 15 different 
end-use devices with one integrated digital platform. More research 
is needed to understand opportunities to realise this sufficiency 
potential for appliances, and more research is needed to understand 
policies which may support these opportunities (Bierwirth and 
Thomas 2019a). 
The difference between baselines is among the main reason for 
difference between the potential estimates in 2030 reported by 
Chapter 6 on buildings of AR4 (Levine et al. 2017) and the current 
section of AR6. For Developed Countries, the sector direct and indirect 
baseline emissions in AR6 are 43% and 28% lower than those in 
AR4 respectively. For developing countries, the sector direct baseline 
emissions in AR6 are 47% lower than those in AR4, and the sector 
indirect baseline emissions are 3% higher than those in AR4. As AR6 
is closer to 2030 than AR4 and thus more precise, the likely reason 
for the difference (besides the fact that some potential was realised) 
is that AR4 overall overestimated the future baseline emissions, and 
it underestimated how quickly the fuel switch to electricity from 
other energy carriers has been happening, especially in developing 
countries. As illustrated, the baseline is one of determinant of 
the potential size and hence, all reported estimates shall only be 
interpreted together with the baseline developments. 
The potential is a dynamic value, increasing with the technological 
progress. Most potential studies reviewed in Section 9.6.1 consider 
today mature commercialised or near to commercialisation 
technologies with demonstrated characteristics ‘freezing them’ 
in the potential estimates until the study target year. Until 2050, 
many of these technologies will further improve, and furthermore 
new advanced technologies may emerge. Therefore, the potential 
estimates are likely to be low estimates of the real potential volumes. 
Furthermore, models apply many other assumptions and they cannot 
always capture right emerging societal or innovation trends; these 
trends may also significantly impact the potential size into both 
directions (Brugger et al. 2021).
With the declining amount of emissions during the building 
operation stage, the share of building embodied emissions in their 
lifetime emissions will grow, also due to additional building material 
(Peñaloza et al. 2018; Cabeza et al. 2021). Reviewing 650 lifecycle 
assessment case studies, Röck et al. (2020) estimated the contribution 
of embodied emissions to building lifetime emissions up to 45–50% 
for highly efficient buildings, surpassing 90% in extreme cases. 
Recently, a  significant body of research has been dedicated to 
studying the impacts of using bio-based solutions (especially timber) 
Chapter 9 Buildings9for building construction instead of conventional materials, such 
as concrete and steel, because more carbon is stored in bio-based 
construction materials than released during their manufacturing. 
Assuming the aggressive use of timber in mid-rise urban buildings, 
Churkina et al. (2020) estimated the associated mitigation potential 
between 0.04–3.7 GtCO 2 per year depending on how fast countries 
adopt new building practices and floor area per  capita. Based on 
a simplified timber supply-demand model for timber-based new floor 
area globally by 2050, Pomponi et al. (2020) showed that the global 
supply of timber can only be 36% of the global demand for it between 

in Asian countries, such as China and India and American countries, 
such as the USA, Mexico, and Argentina. Goswein et  al. (2021) 
conducted a similar detailed analysis for Europe and concluded that 
current European forest areas and wheat plantations are sufficient to 
provide timber and straw for the domestic construction sector. 
The increased use of timber and other bio-based materials in buildings 
brings not only benefits, but also risks. The increased use of timber 
can accelerate degradation through poor management and the 
pressure for deforestation, as already recorded in the Amazon and 
Siberia forests, and the competition for land and resources (Carrasco 
et al. 2017; Brancalion et al. 2018; Hart and Pomponi 2020; Pomponi 
et al. 2020). Churkina et al. (2020) emphasised that promoting the 
use of more timber in buildings requires the parallel strengthening 
of legislation for sustainable forest management, forest certification 
instruments, and care for the people and social organisations that 
live in forests. In tropical and subtropical countries, the use of 
bamboo and other fibres brings more benefits and less risks than 
the use of timber (ibid). One of the main barriers associated with the 
use of bio-based materials in buildings is fire safety, although there 
is extensive research on this topic (Östman et  al. 2017; Audebert 
et al. 2019). This is a particularly important criterion for the design of 
medium and high-rise buildings, which tend to be the most adequate 
typologies for denser and more compact cities. Overall, more robust 
models are needed to assess the interlinkages between the enhanced 
use of bio-based materials in the building stock and economic and 
social implications of their larger supply, as well as the associated 
competition between forest and land-use activities (for food), and 
ecological aspects. Furthermore, more research is required on how 
to change forest and building legislation and design a combination 
of policy instruments for the specific political, economic and cultural 
county characteristics (Hildebrandt et al. 2017). Benefits and risks of 
enhanced use of wood products in buildings are also discussed in 
Chapter 7, Section 7.4.5.3.
9.7 Links to Adaptation
Buildings are capital-intensive and long-lasting assets designed to 
perform under a  wide range of climate conditions (Hallegatte 2009; 
Pyke et al. 2012). Their long lifespan means that the building stock will 
be exposed to future climate (Hallegatte 2009; de Wilde and Coley 2012; 
Wan et al. 2012) and, as such, adaptation measures will be necessary. 

is higher than a given threshold temperature (Mistry 2019).The impacts of climate change on buildings can affect building 
structures, building construction, building material properties, indoor 
climate and building energy use (Andrić et al. 2019). Many of those 
impacts and their respective adaptation strategies interact with GHG 
mitigation in different ways.
9.7.1 Climate Change Impacts and Adaptation 
in Buildings
A large body of literature on climate impacts on buildings focuses 
on the impacts of climate change on heating and cooling needs 
(de Wilde and Coley 2012; Wan et al. 2012; Andrić et al. 2019). The 
associated impacts on energy consumption are expected to be higher 
in hot summer and warm winter climates, where cooling needs are 
more relevant (Li et al. 2012; Wan et al. 2012; Andrić et al. 2019). If not 
met, this higher demand for thermal comfort can impact health, sleep 
quality and work productivity, having disproportionate effects on 
vulnerable populations and exacerbating energy poverty (Biardeau 
et al. 2020; Sun et al. 2020; Falchetta and Mistry 2021) (Section 9.8). 
Increasing temperatures can lead to higher cooling needs and, 
therefore, energy consumption (Li et  al. 2012; Schaeffer et  al. 
2012; Wan et  al. 2012; Clarke et  al. 2018; International Energy 
Agency 2018; Andrić et al. 2019). Higher temperatures increase the 
number of days/hours in which cooling is required and as outdoor 
temperatures increase, the cooling load to maintain the same indoor 
temperature will be higher (Andrić et al. 2019). These two effects are 
often measured by cooling degree-days1 (CDD) and there is a vast 
literature on studies at the global (Isaac and van Vuuren 2009; Atalla 
et  al. 2018; Clarke et  al. 2018; Mistry 2019; Biardeau et  al. 2020) 
and regional level (Zhou et al. 2014; Bezerra et al. 2021; Falchetta 
and Mistry 2021). Other studies use statistical econometric analyses 
to capture the empirical relationship between climate variables and 
energy consumption (Auffhammer and Mansur 2014; van Ruijven 
et al. 2019). A third effect is that higher summer temperatures can 
incentivise the purchase of space cooling equipment (Auffhammer 
2014; De Cian et  al. 2019; Biardeau et  al. 2020), especially in 
developing countries (Pavanello et al. 2021). 
The impacts of increased energy demand for cooling can have 
systemic repercussions (Ciscar and Dowling 2014; Ralston Fonseca 
et al. 2019), which in turn can affect the provision of other energy 
services. Space cooling can be an important determinant of peak 
demand, especially in periods of extreme heat (International Energy 
Agency 2018). Warmer climates and higher frequency and intensity 
of heat waves can lead to higher loads (Dirks et al. 2015; Auffhammer 
et al. 2017), increasing the risk of grid failure and supply interruptions.
Although heating demand in cold climate regions can be expected 
to decrease with climate change and, to a  certain extent, outweigh 
the increase in cooling demand, the effects on total primary energy 
requirements are uncertain (Li et  al. 2012; Wan et  al. 2012). Studies 
have found that increases in buildings energy expenditures for cooling 
Buildings  Chapter 99more than compensate the savings from lower heating demands in 
most regions (Clarke et al. 2018). In addition, climate change may affect 
the economic feasibility of district heating systems (Andrić et al. 2019). 
In cold climates, a  warming climate can potentially increase the 
risk of overheating in high-performance buildings with increased 
insulation and airtightness to reduce heat losses (Gupta and Gregg 
2012). In such situations, the need for active cooling technologies 
may arise, along with higher energy consumption and GHG emissions 
(Gupta et al. 2015). 
Changes in cloud formation can affect global solar irradiation 
and, therefore, the output of solar photovoltaic panels, possibly 
affecting on-site renewable energy production (Burnett et al. 2014). 
The efficiency of solar photovoltaic panels and their electrical 
components decreases with higher temperatures (Bahaidarah et al. 
2013; Simioni and Schaeffer 2019). However, studies have found that 
such effects can be relatively small (Totschnig et al. 2017), making 
solar PV a robust option to adapt to climate change (Shen and Lior 
2016; Santos and Lucena 2021) (see Section 9.4). 
Climate change can also affect the performance, durability and 
safety of buildings and their elements (facades, structure, etc.) 
through changes in temperature, humidity, wind, and chloride and 
CO2 concentrations (Bastidas-Arteaga et al. 2010; Bauer et al. 2018; 
Rodríguez-Rosales et al. 2021; Chen et al. 2021). Historical buildings 
and coastal areas tend to be more vulnerable to these changes 
(Huijbregts et al. 2012; Mosoarca et al. 2019; Cavalagli et al. 2019; 
Rodríguez-Rosales et al. 2021). 
Temperature variations affect the building envelope, for example, 
with cracks and detachment of coatings (Bauer et al. 2016, 2018). 
Higher humidity (caused by wind-driven rain, snow or floods) hastens 
deterioration of bio-based materials such as wood and bamboo 
(Brambilla and Gasparri 2020), also deteriorating indoor air quality 
and users health (Huijbregts et al. 2012; Grynning et al. 2017; Lee 
et al. 2020). 
Climate change can accelerate the degradation of reinforced 
concrete structures due to the increase of chloride ingress (Bastidas-
Arteaga et al. 2010) and the concentration of CO 2, which increase 
the corrosion of the embedded steel (Stewart et  al. 2012; Peng 
and Stewart 2016; Chen et al. 2021). Corrosion rates are higher in 
places with higher humidity and humidity fluctuations (Guo et  al. 
2019), and degradation could be faster with combined effects of 
higher temperatures and more frequent and intense precipitations 
(Bastidas-Arteaga et al. 2010; Chen et al. 2021). 
Higher frequency and intensity of hurricanes, storm surges and 
coastal and non-coastal flooding can escalate economic losses to 
civil infrastructure, especially when associated with population 
growth and urbanisation in hazardous areas (Bjarnadottir et al. 2011; 
Li et  al. 2016; Lee and Ellingwood 2017). Climate change should 
increase the risk and exposure to damage from flood (de Ruig et al. 
2019), sea level rise (Bosello and De Cian 2014; Zanetti et al. 2016; 
Bove et al. 2020) and more frequent wildfires (Barkhordarian et al. 
2018; Craig et al. 2020).9.7.2 Links Between Mitigation and Adaptation 
in Buildings
Adaptation options interacts with mitigation efforts because 
measures to cope with climate change impacts can increase energy 
and material consumption, which may lead to higher GHG emissions 
(Kalvelage et  al. 2014; Davide et  al. 2019; Sharifi 2020). Energy 
consumption is required to adapt to climate change. Mitigation 
measures, in turn, influence the degree of vulnerability of buildings 
to future climate and, thus, the adaptation required.
Studies have assessed the increases in energy demand to meet indoor 
thermal comfort under future climate (de Wilde and Coley 2012; 
Li et al. 2012; Clarke et al. 2018; Andrić et al. 2019). Higher cooling 
needs may induce increases in energy demand (Wan et  al. 2012; 
Li et al. 2012), which could lead to higher emissions, when electricity 
is fossil-based (International Energy Agency 2018; Biardeau et  al. 
2020), and generate higher loads and stress on power systems (Dirks 
et al. 2015; Auffhammer et al. 2017). In this regard, increasing energy 
efficiency of space cooling appliances and adopting dynamic cooling 
setpoint temperatures, can reduce the energy needs for cooling and 
limit additional emissions and pressures on power systems (Davide 
et  al. 2019; Bienvenido-Huertas et  al. 2020; Bezerra et  al. 2021) 
(Section 9.4, Figure 9.11 and Supplementary Material Tables 9.SM.1 
to 9.SM.3). This can also be achieved with on-site renewable energy 
production, especially solar PV for which there can be a  timely 
correlation between power supply and cooling demand, improving 
load matching (Salom et al. 2014; Grove-Smith et al. 2018).
Mitigation alternatives through passive approaches may increase 
resilience to climate change impacts on thermal comfort and reduce 
active cooling needs (Wan et al. 2012; van Hooff et al. 2016; Andrić 
et al. 2019; González Mahecha et al. 2020; Rosse Caldas et al. 2020). 
Combining passive measures can help counteracting climate change 
driven increases in energy consumption for achieving thermal 
comfort (Huang and Hwang 2016).
Studies raise the concern that measures aimed at building envelope 
may increase the risk of overheating in a warming climate (Dodoo 
and Gustavsson 2016; Fosas et al. 2018) (Section 9.4). If this is the 
case, there may be a  conflict between mitigation through energy 
efficiency building regulations and climate change adaptation (Fosas 
et al. 2018). However, while overheating may occur as a result of poor 
insulation design, better insulation may actually reduce overheating 
when properly projected and the overheating risk can be overcome 
by clever designs (Fosas et al. 2018). 
Strengthening building structures to increase resilience and reduce 
exposure to the risk of extreme events, such as draughts, torrential floods, 
hurricanes and storms, can be partially achieved by improving building 
standards and retrofitting existing buildings (Bjarnadottir et al. 2011). 
However, future climate is not yet considered in parameters of existing 
building energy codes (Steenbergen et  al. 2012). While enhancing 
structural resilience would lead to GHG emissions (Liu and Cui 2018), 
so would disaster recovery and rebuilding. This adaptation-mitigation 
trade-off needs to be further assessed.
Chapter 9 Buildings9Since adaptation of the existing building stock may be more expensive 
and require building retrofit, climate change must be considered 
in the design of new buildings to ensure performance robustness in 
both current and future climates, which can have implications for 
construction costs (Hallegatte 2009; Pyke et al. 2012; de Wilde and 
Coley 2012; de Rubeis et al. 2020; Picard et al. 2020) and emissions 
(Liu and Cui 2018). Building energy codes and regulations are usually 
based on cost-effectiveness and historical climate data, which can lead 
to the poor design of thermal comfort in future climate (Hallegatte 
2009; Pyke et al. 2012; de Wilde and Coley 2012) and non-efficient 
active adaptive measures based on mechanical air conditioning 
(De Cian et al. 2019) (Section 9.4, Figure 9.11 and Supplementary 
Material Tables 9.SM.1 to 9.SM.3). However, uncertainty about future 
climate change creates difficulties for projecting parameters for the 
design of new buildings (Hallegatte 2009; de Wilde and Coley 2012). 
This can be especially relevant for social housing programs (Rubio-
Bellido et al. 2017; Triana et al. 2018; González Mahecha et al. 2020) 
in developing countries. 
The impacts on buildings can lead to higher maintenance needs 
and the consequent embodied environmental impacts related 
to materials production, transportation and end-of-life, which 
account for a relevant share of GHG emissions in buildings lifecycle 
(Rasmussen et  al. 2018). Climate change induced biodegradation 
is especially important for bio-based materials such as wood and 
bamboo (Brambilla and Gasparri 2020) which are important options 
for reducing emissions imbued in buildings’ construction materials 
(Peñaloza et al. 2016; Churkina et al. 2020; Rosse Caldas et al. 2020). 
Although there can potentially be conflicts between climate change 
mitigation and adaptation, these can be dealt with proper planning, 
actions, and policies. The challenge is to develop multifunctional 
solutions, technologies and materials that can mitigate GHG 
emissions while improving buildings adaptive capacity. Solutions 
and technologies should reduce not only buildings’ operational 
emissions, but also embodied emissions from manufacturing and 
processing of building materials (Röck et  al. 2020). For instance, 
some building materials, such as bio-concrete, can reduce lifecycle 
emissions of buildings and bring benefits in terms of building thermal 
comfort in tropical and subtropical climates. Also, energy efficiency, 
sufficiency and on-site renewable energy production can help to 
increase building resilience to climate change impacts and reduce 
pressure on the energy system.
9.8 Links to Sustainable Development
9.8.1 Overview of Contribution of Mitigation Options 
to Sustainable Development
A growing body of research acknowledges that mitigation actions 
in buildings may have substantial social and economic value 
beyond their direct impact of reducing energy consumption and/
or GHG emissions (IEA 2014; Ürge-Vorsatz et al. 2016; Deng et al. 
2017; Reuter et  al. 2017; US EPA 2018; Kamal et  al. 2019; Bleyl 
et al. 2019) (see also Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 7). In other 
words, the implementation of these actions in the residential and non-residential sector holds numerous multiple impacts (co-benefits, 
adverse side-effects, trade-offs, risks, etc.) for the economy, society 
and end-users, in both developed and developing economies, which 
can be categorised into the following types (IEA 2014; Ürge-Vorsatz 
et al. 2016; Ferreira et al. 2017; Thema et al. 2017; Reuter et al. 2017; 
US EPA 2018; Nikas et al. 2020): (i) health impacts due to better indoor 
conditions, energy/fuel poverty alleviation, better ambient air quality 
and reduction of the heat island effect; (ii) environmental benefits 
such as reduced local air pollution and the associated impact on 
ecosystems (acidification, eutrophication, etc.) and infrastructures, 
reduced sewage production, and so on; (iii) improved resource 
management including water and energy; (iv) impact on social well-
being, including changes in disposable income due to decreased 
energy expenditures and/or distributional costs of new policies, fuel 
poverty alleviation and improved access to energy sources, rebound 
effects, increased productive time for women and children, and 
so on; (v) microeconomic effects (e.g.,  productivity gains in non-
residential buildings, enhanced asset values of green buildings, 
fostering innovation); (vi) macroeconomic effects, including impact 
on GDP driven by energy savings and energy availability, creation of 
new jobs, decreased employment in the fossil energy sector, long-
term reductions in energy prices and possible increases in electricity 
prices in the medium run, possible impacts on public budgets, and 
so on; and (vii) energy security implications (e.g., access to modern 
energy resources, reduced import dependency, increase of supplier 
diversity, smaller reserve requirements, increased sovereignty 
and resilience). 
Well-designed and effectively implemented mitigation actions in 
the sector of buildings have significant potential for achieving 
the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
Specifically, the multiple impacts of mitigation policies and measures 
go far beyond the goal of climate action (SDG 13) and contribute 
to further activating a  great variety of other SDGs (Figure  9.18 
presents some indicative examples). Table 9.5 reviews and updates 
the analysis carried out in the context of the IPCC Special Report 
on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5) (Roy et al. 2018) demonstrating 
that the main categories of GHG emission reduction interventions 
in buildings, namely the implementation of energy sufficiency and 
efficiency improvements as well as improved access and fuel switch 
to modern low carbon energy, contribute to achieving 16 out of 
a total of 17 SDGs. 
A review of a relatively limited number of studies made by Ürge-
Vorsatz et al. (2016) and Payne et al. (2015) showed that the size 
of multiple benefits of mitigation actions in the sector of buildings 
may range from 22% up to 7400% of the corresponding energy 
cost savings. In 7 out of 11 case studies reviewed, the value of the 
multiple impacts of mitigation actions was equal or greater than 
the value of energy savings. Even in these studies, several effects 
have not been measured and consequently the size of multiple 
benefits of mitigation actions may be even higher. Quantifying 
and if possible, monetising, these wider impacts of climate action 
would facilitate their inclusion in cost-benefit analysis, strengthen 
the adoption of ambitious emissions reduction targets, and improve 
coordination across policy areas reducing costs (Smith et al. 2016; 
Thema et al. 2017).

9.8.2 Climate Mitigation Actions in Buildings 
and Health Impacts
9.8.2.1 Lack of Access to Clean Energy
In 2018, approximately 2.8 billion people worldwide, most of whom 
live in Asia and Africa, still use polluting fuels, such as fuelwood, 
charcoal, dried crops, cow dung, and so on, in low-efficiency stoves 
for cooking and heating, generating household air pollution (HAP), 
which adversely affects the health of the occupants of the dwellings, 
especially children and women (World Health Organization 2016; 
Rahut et al. 2017; Mehetre et al. 2017; Das et al. 2018; Liu et al. 2018; 
Quinn et al. 2018; Rosenthal et al. 2018; Xin et al. 2018; IEA 2020a). 
Exposure to HAP from burning these fuels is estimated to have caused 
3.8 million deaths from heart diseases, strokes, cancers, acute lower 
respiratory infections in 2016 (World Health Organization 2018). 
It is acknowledged that integrated policies are needed to address 
simultaneously universal energy access, limiting climate change 
and reducing air pollution (World Health Organization 2016). Rafaj 
et al. (2018) showed that a scenario achieving these SDGs in 2030 
will imply in 2040 two million fewer premature deaths from HAP compared to current levels, and 1.5 million fewer premature deaths 
in relation to a reference scenario, which assumes the continuation 
of existing and planned policies. The level of incremental investment 
needed in developing countries to achieve universal access to modern 
energy was estimated at around USD0.8 trillion cumulatively to 2040 
in the scenarios examined (Rafaj et al. 2018). 
At the core of these policies is the promotion of improved cook-
stoves and other modern energy-efficient appliances to cook (for the 
health benefits of improved cook-stoves see for example (García-
Frapolli et al. 2010; Malla et al. 2011; Aunan et al. 2013; Jeuland et al. 
2018), as well as the use of non-solid fuels by poor households in 
developing countries (Figure 9.19). Most studies agree that the use of 
non-solid energy options such as LPG, ethanol, biogas, piped natural 
gas, and electricity is more effective in reducing the health impacts of 
HAP compared to improved biomass stoves (see for example Larsen 
2016; Rosenthal et  al. 2018; Steenland et  al. 2018; Goldemberg 
et al. 2018). On the other hand, climate change mitigation policies 
(e.g., carbon pricing) may increase the costs of some of these clean 
fuels (e.g.,  LPG, electricity), slowing down their penetration in the 
poor segment of the population and restricting the associated health Notes:  The strength of interaction between mitigation actions and SDGs is described with a seven-point scale (Nilsson et al., 2016). Also, the blue bullet shows the interactions 
between co-benefits/risk associated with mitigation actions and the SDGs. SDG 1: Sufficiency and efficiency measures result in reduced energy expenditures and other financial 
savings that further lead to poverty reduction. Access to modern energy forms will largely help alleviate poverty in developing countries as the productive time of women and 
children will increase, new activities can be developed, and so on. The distributional costs of some mitigation policies promoting energy efficiency and lower carbon energy may 
reduce the disposable income of the poor. SDG 2: Energy sufficiency and efficiency measures result in lower energy bills and avoiding the ‘heat or eat’ dilemma. Improved cook-
stoves provide better food security and reduces the danger of fuel shortages in developing countries; under real-world conditions these impacts may be limited as the households 
use these stoves irregularly and inappropriately. Green roofs can support food production. Improving energy access enhances agricultural productivity and improves food security; 
on the other hand, increased bioenergy production may restrict the available land for food production. SDG 3: All categories of mitigation action result in health benefits through 
better indoor air quality, energy/fuel poverty alleviation, better ambient air quality, and reduction of the heat island effect. Efficiency measures with inadequate ventilation may 
lead to the “sick building” syndrome symptoms. SDG 4: Energy efficiency measures result in reduced school absenteeism due to better indoor environmental conditions. Also, fuel 
poverty alleviation increases the available space at home for reading. Improved access to electricity and clean fuels enables people living in poor developing countries to read, 
while it is also associated with greater school attendance by children. SDG 5: Efficient cook-stoves and improved access to electricity and clean fuels in developing countries will 
result in substantial time savings for women and children, thus increasing the time for rest, communication, education and productive activities. SDG 6: Reduced energy demand 
due to sufficiency and efficiency measures as well as an upscaling of renewable energy sources (RES) can lead to reduced water demand for thermal cooling at energy production 
facilities. Also, water savings result through improved conditions and lower space of dwellings. Improved access to electricity is necessary to treat water at homes. In some 
situations, the switch to bioenergy could increase water use compared to existing conditions. SDG 7: All categories of mitigation action result in energy/fuel poverty alleviation 
in both developed and developing countries as well as in improving the security of energy supply. SDG 8: Positive and negative direct and indirect macroeconomic effects (GDP , 
employment, public budgets) associated with lower energy prices due to the reduced energy demand, energy efficiency and RES investments, improved energy access and fostering 
innovation. Also, energy efficient buildings with adequate ventilation, result in productivity gains and improve the competitiveness of the economy. SDG 9: Adoption of distributed 
generation and smart grids helps in infrastructure improvement and expansion. Also, the development of ‘green buildings’ can foster innovation. Reduced energy demand due to 
sufficiency and efficiency measures as well as an upscaling of RES can lead to early retirement of fossil energy infrastructure. SDG 10: Efficient cook-stoves as well as improved 
access to electricity and clean fuels in developing countries will result in substantial time savings for women and children, thus enhancing education and the development of 
productive activities. Sufficiency and efficiency measures lead to lower energy expenditures, thus reducing income inequalities. The distributional costs of some mitigation policies 
promoting energy efficiency and lower carbon energy as well as the need for purchasing more expensive equipment and appliances may reduce the disposable income of the poor 
and increase inequalities. SDG 11: Sufficiency and efficiency measures as well as fuel switching to RES and improvements in energy access would eliminate major sources (both 
direct and indirect) of poor air quality (indoor and outdoor). Helpful if in-situ production of RES combined with charging electric two, three and four wheelers at home. Buildings 
with high energy efficiency and/or green features are sold/rented at higher prices than conventional, low energy efficient houses. SDG 12: Energy sufficiency and efficiency 
measures as well as deployment of RES result in reduced consumption of natural resources, namely fossil fuels, metal ores, minerals, water, and so on. Negative impacts on natural 
resources could be arisen from increased penetration of new efficient appliances and equipment. SDG 13: See Sections 9.4–9.6. SDG 15: Efficient cookstoves and improved 
access to electricity and clean fuels in developing countries will result in halting deforestation. SDG 16: Building retrofits are associated with lower crime. Improved access to 
electric lighting can improve safety (particularly for women and children). Institutions that are effective, accountable and transparent are needed at all levels of government for 
providing energy access and promoting modern renewables as well as boosting sufficiency and efficiency. SDG 17: The development of zero energy buildings requires among 
others capacity building, citizen participation as well as monitoring of the achievements.

benefits (Cameron et  al. 2016). In this case, appropriate access 
policies should be designed to efficiently shield poor households 
from the burden of carbon taxation (Cameron et  al. 2016). The 
evaluation of the improved biomass burning cook-stoves under real-
world conditions has shown that they have lower than expected, and 
in many cases limited, long-run health and environmental impacts, 
as the households use these stoves irregularly and inappropriately, 
fail to maintain them, and their usage decline over time (Patange 
et al. 2015; Aung et al. 2016; Hanna et al. 2016; Wathore et al. 2017). 
In this context, the various improved cook-stoves programs should 
consider the mid- and long-term needs of maintenance, repair, or 
replacement to support their sustained use (Shankar et  al. 2014; 
Schilmann et al. 2019).
Electrification of households in rural or remote areas results 
also to significant health benefits. For example, in El Salvador, 
rural electrification of households leads to reduced overnight air 
pollutants concentration by 63% due to the substitution of kerosene 
as a lighting source, and 34–44% less acute respiratory infections 
among children under six (Torero 2015). In addition, the connection 
of the health centres to the grid leads to improvements in the quality 
of health care provided (Lenz et al. 2017).
9.8.2.2 Energy/fuel Poverty, Indoor Environmental 
Quality and Health
Living in fuel poverty, and particularly in cold and damp housing is 
related to excess winter mortality and increased morbidity rates due 
to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, arthritic and rheumatic illnesses, asthma, and so on (Lacroix and Chaton 2015; Payne et al. 
2015; Camprubí et al. 2016; Wilson et al. 2016; Ormandy and Ezratty 
2016; Thema et  al. 2017). In addition, lack of affordable warmth 
can generate stress related to chronic discomfort and high bills, 
fear of falling into debt, and a sense of lacking control, which are 
potential drivers of further negative mental health outcomes, such as 
depression (Howden-Chapman et al. 2012; Liddell and Guiney 2015; 
Payne et  al. 2015; Wilson et  al. 2016). Health risks from exposure 
to cold and inadequate indoor environmental quality may be higher 
for low-income, energy-poor households, and in particular for those 
with elderly relatives, young children, and members with existing 
respiratory illness (Payne et al. 2015; Thomson et al. 2017b; Nunes 
2019). High temperatures during summer can also be dangerous 
for people living in buildings with inadequate thermal insulation 
and inappropriate ventilation (Ormandy and Ezratty 2016; Sanchez-
Guevara et al. 2019; Thomson et al. 2019). Summer fuel poverty (or 
summer overheating risk) may increase significantly in the coming 
decades under a warming climate (Section 9.7), with the poorest, who 
cannot afford to install air conditioning, and the elderly (Nunes 2020) 
being the most vulnerable. 
Improved energy efficiency in buildings contributes in fuel poverty 
alleviation and brings health gains through improved indoor 
temperatures and comfort as well as reduced fuel consumption and 
associated financial stress (Curl et al. 2015; Lacroix and Chaton 2015; 
Liddell and Guiney 2015; Thomson and Thomas 2015; Willand et al. 
2015; Poortinga et al. 2018). On the other hand, households suffering 
most from fuel poverty experience more barriers for undertaking 
building retrofits (Braubach and Ferrand 2013; Camprubí et al. 2016; Eastern Asia
South Asia, South-East

Chapter 9 Buildings9Charlier et al. 2018), moderating the potential health gains associated 
with implemented energy efficiency programs. This can be avoided if 
implemented policies to tackle fuel poverty target the most socially 
vulnerable households (Lacroix and Chaton 2015; Camprubí et  al. 
2016). Mzavanadze (2018a) estimated that in EU-28 accelerated 
energy efficiency policies, reducing the energy demand in residential 
sector by 333 TWh in 2030 compared to a  reference scenario, 
coupled with strong social policies targeting the most vulnerable 
households, could deliver additional co-benefits in the year of 2030 
of around 24,500 avoided premature deaths due to indoor cold 
and around 22,300 disability adjusted life years (DALYs) of avoided 
asthma due to indoor dampness. The health benefits of these policies 
amount to EUR4.8 billion in 2030. The impacts on inhabitants in 
developing countries would be much greater than those in EU-28 
owing to the much higher prevalence of impoverished household.
Apart from thermal comfort, the internal environment of buildings 
impacts public health through a  variety of pathways including 
inadequate ventilation, poor indoor air quality, chemical contaminants 
from indoor or outdoor sources, outdoor noise, or poor lighting. 
The implementation of interventions aiming to improve thermal 
insulation of buildings combined with inadequate ventilation may 
increase the risk of mould and moisture problems due to reduced air 
flow rates, leading to indoor environments that are unhealthy, with 
the occupants suffering from the sick building syndrome symptoms 
(Willand et  al. 2015; Cedeño-Laurent et  al. 2018; Wierzbicka et  al. 
2018). On the other hand, if the implementation of energy efficiency 
interventions or the construction of green buildings is accompanied 
by adequate ventilation, the indoor environmental conditions are 
improved through less moisture, mould, pollutant concentrations, 
and allergens, which result in fewer asthma symptoms, respiratory 
risks, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, heart disease risks, 
headaches, cancer risks, and so on (Allen et al. 2015; Hamilton et al. 
2015; Thomson and Thomas 2015; Cowell 2016; Doll et  al. 2016; 
Wilson et  al. 2016; Militello-Hourigan and Miller 2018; Underhill 
et  al. 2018; Cedeño-Laurent et  al. 2018). Fisk (2018) showed that 
increased ventilation rates in residential buildings results in health 
benefits ranging from 20% to several-fold improvements; however, 
these benefits do not occur consistently, and ventilation should 
be combined with other exposure control measures. As adequate 
ventilation imposes additional costs, the sick building syndrome 
symptoms are more likely to be seen in low income households 
(Shrubsole et al. 2016). 
The health benefits of residents due to mitigation actions in buildings 
are significant (for a review see Maidment et al. 2014; Thomson and 
Thomas 2015; Fisk et al. 2020), and are higher among low income 
households and/or vulnerable groups, including children, the elderly 
and those with pre-existing illnesses (Maidment et  al. 2014; IEA 
2014; Ortiz et al. 2019). Tonn et al. (2018) estimated that the health-
related benefits attributed to the two weatherisation programs 
implemented in the US in 2008 and 2010 exceeds by a factor of 3 
the corresponding energy cost savings yield. IEA (2014) also found 
that the health benefits attributed to energy efficiency retrofit 
programs may outweigh their costs by up to a factor of 3. Ortiz et al. 
(2019) estimated that the energy retrofit of vulnerable households 
in Spain requires an investment of around EUR10.9–12.3 thousands per dwelling and would generate an average saving to the healthcare 
system of EUR372 per  year and dwelling (due to better thermal 
comfort conditions in winter).
9.8.2.3 Outdoor Air Pollution
According to World Health Organization (2018) around 4.2 million 
premature deaths worldwide (in both cities and rural areas) are 
attributed to outdoor air pollution. According to the results of the 
quantitative model (Gu et  al. 2018), the premature mortalities 
attributed to PM 2.5 and O 3 emissions may reach 168000–1796000 
(95% Cl) in 2010. Mitigation actions in residential and non-residential 
sectors decrease the amount of fossil fuels burnt either directly in 
buildings (for heating, cooking, etc.) or indirectly for electricity 
generation and thereby reduce air pollution (e.g., PM, O 3, SO 2, NO x), 
improve ambient air quality and generate significant health benefits 
through avoiding premature deaths, lung cancers, ischemic heart 
diseases, hospital admissions, asthma exacerbations, respiratory 
symptoms, and so on (Levy et  al. 2016; Balaban and Puppim de 
Oliveira 2017; MacNaughton et al. 2018; Karlsson et al. 2020). Several 
studies have monetised the health benefits attributed to reduced 
outdoor air pollution due to the implementation of mitigation actions 
in buildings, and their magnitude expressed as a ratio to the value of 
energy savings resulting from the implemented interventions in each 
case, are in the range of 0.08 in EU, 0.18 in Germany, 0.26–0.40 in US, 
0.34 in Brazil, 0.47 in Mexico, 0.74 in Turkey, 8.28 in China and 11.67 
in India (Joyce et al. 2013; Levy et al. 2016; Diaz-Mendez et al. 2018; 
MacNaughton et al. 2018). In developed economies, the estimated 
co-benefits are relatively low due to the fact that the planned 
interventions influence a  quite clean energy source mix (Tuomisto 
et al. 2015; MacNaughton et al. 2018). On the other hand, the health 
co-benefits in question are substantially higher in countries and 
regions with greater dependency on coal for electricity generation 
and higher baseline morbidity and mortality rates (Kheirbek et  al. 
2014; MacNaughton et al. 2018). 
9.8.3 Other Environmental Benefits  
of Mitigation Actions
Apart from the health benefits mentioned above, mitigation actions 
in the buildings sector are also associated with environmental 
benefits to ecosystems and crops, by avoiding acidification and 
eutrophication, biodiversity through green roofs and walls, building 
environment through reduced corrosion of materials, and so on 
(Thema et al. 2017; Mzavanadze 2018b; Knapp et al. 2019; Mayrand 
and Clergeau 2018), while some negative effects cannot be excluded 
(Dylewski and Adamczyk 2016). 
Also, very important are the effects of mitigation actions in buildings 
on the reduction of consumption of natural resources, namely fossil 
fuels, metal ores, minerals, and so on. These comprise savings from 
the resulting reduced consumption of fuels, electricity and heat and 
the lifecycle-wide resource demand for their utilities, as well as 
potential net savings from the substitution of energy technologies 
used in buildings  – production phase extraction (European 
Commission 2016; Thema et  al. 2017). Teubler et  al. (2020) found 
Buildings  Chapter 99that the implementation of an energy efficiency scenario in European 
buildings will result in resource savings (considering only those 
associated with the generation of final energy products) of 406 kg 
per MWh lower final energy demand in the residential sector, while 
the corresponding figure for non-residential buildings was estimated 
at 706 kg per MWh of reduced energy demand. On the other hand, 
Smith et al. (2016) claim that a switch to more efficient appliances 
could result in negative impacts from increased resource use, which 
can be mitigated by avoiding premature replacement and maximising 
recycling of old appliances.
Mitigation actions aiming to reduce the embodied energy of buildings 
through using local and sustainable building materials can be used to 
leverage new supply chains (e.g., for forestry products), which in turn 
bring further environmental and social benefits to local communities 
(Hashemi et  al. 2015; Cheong and Storey 2019). Furthermore, 
improved insulation and the installation of double- or triple-glazed 
windows result in reduced noise levels. It is worth mentioning that 
for every 1 dB decrease in excess noise, academic performance in 
schools and productivity of employees in office buildings increases by 
0.7% and 0.3% respectively (Kockat et al. 2018b). Smith et al. (2016) 
estimated that in the UK the annual noise benefits associated with 
energy renovations in residential buildings may reach £400 million in 

9.8.4 Social Wellbeing
9.8.4.1 Energy/Fuel Poverty Alleviation 
In 2018 almost 0.79 billion people in developing countries did not 
have access to electricity, while approximately 2.8 billion people 
relied on polluting fuels and technologies for cooking (IEA 2020a). 
Only in sub-Saharan Africa, about 548 million people (i.e.,  more 
than 50% of the population) live without electricity. In developed 
economies, the EU Energy Poverty Observatory estimated that in EU-

41.5 million had arrears on their utility bills the same year, 16.3% 
of households faced disproportionately high energy expenditure in 
2010, and 19.2% of households reported being uncomfortably hot 
during summer in 2012 (Thomson and Bouzarovski 2018). Okushima 
(2016), using the ‘expenditure approach’, estimated that fuel poverty 
rates in Japan reached 8.4% in 2013. In the US, in 2015, 17 million 
households (14.4% of the total) received an energy disconnect/
delivery stop notice and 25 million households (21.2% of the total) 
had to forgo food and medicine to pay energy bills (Bednar and 
Reames 2020). 
The implementation of well-designed climate mitigation measures in 
buildings can help to reduce energy/fuel poverty and improve living 
conditions with significant benefits for health (Section  9.8.2) and 
well-being (Payne et al. 2015; Smith et al. 2016; Tonn et al. 2018). 
The social implications of energy poverty alleviation for the people 
in low- and middle-income developing countries with no access to 
clean energy fuels are further discussed in Section 9.8.4.2. In other 
developing countries and in developed economies as well, the 
implementation of mitigation measures can improve the ability of households to affordably heat/cool a larger area of the home, thus 
increasing the space available to a family and providing more private 
and comfortable spaces for several activities like homework (Payne 
et  al. 2015). By reducing energy expenditures and making energy 
bills more affordable for households, a ‘heat or eat’ dilemma can be 
avoided resulting in better nutrition and reductions in the number 
of low birthweight babies (Payne et al. 2015; Tonn et al. 2018). Also, 
renovated buildings and the resulting better indoor conditions, 
can enable residents to avoid social isolation, improve social 
cohesion, lower crime, and so on (Payne et al. 2015). The European 
Commission (2016) found that under an ambitious recast of Energy 
Performance Buildings Directive (EPBD), the number of households 
that may be lifted from fuel poverty across the EU lies between 
5.17 and 8.26 million. To capture these benefits, mitigation policies 
and  particularly energy renovation programmes should target the 
most vulnerable among the energy-poor households, which very often 
are ignored by the policy makers. In this context, it is recognised that 
fuel poverty should be analysed as a multidimensional social problem 
(Thomson et  al. 2017b; Baker et  al. 2018; Charlier and Legendre 
2019; Mashhoodi et al. 2019), as it is related to energy efficiency, 
household composition, age and health status of its members, 
social conditions (single parent families, existence of unemployed 
and retired people, etc.), energy prices, disposable income, and so 
on. In addition, the geographical dimension can have a significant 
impact on the levels of fuel poverty and should be taken into account 
when formulating response policies (Besagni and Borgarello 2019; 
Mashhoodi et al. 2019).
9.8.4.2 Improved Access to Energy Sources, Gender 
Equality and Time Savings
In most low- and middle-income developing countries women and 
children (particularly girls) spend a significant amount of their time for 
gathering fuels for cooking and heating (World Health Organization 
2016; Rosenthal et al. 2018). For example, in Africa more than 70% 
of the children living in households that primarily cook with polluting 
fuels spend at least 15 hours and, in some countries, more than 

safety risks and constraints on their available time for education and 
rest (World Health Organization 2016; Mehetre et  al. 2017). Also, 
in several developing countries (e.g., in most African countries but 
also in India, in rural areas in Latin America and elsewhere) women 
spend several hours to collect fuel wood and cook, thus limiting 
their potential for productive activities for income generation or 
rest (García-Frapolli et  al. 2010; World Health Organization 2016; 
Mehetre et al. 2017). Expanding access to clean household energy 
for cooking, heating and lighting will largely help alleviate these 
burdens (Malla et al. 2011; World Health Organization 2016; Lewis 
et al. 2017; Rosenthal et al. 2018). Jeuland et al. (2018) found that the 
time savings associated with the adoption of cleaner and more fuel-
efficient stoves by low-income households in developing countries 
are amount to USD1.3–1.9 per  household per  month, constituting 
the 23–43% of the total social benefits attributed to the promotion 
of clean stoves. 
Electrification of remote rural areas and other regions that do not 
have access to electricity enables people living in poor developing 
Chapter 9 Buildings9countries to read, socialise, and be more productive during the 
evening, while it is also associated with greater school attendance 
by children (Torero 2015; Rao et al. 2016; Barnes and Samad 2018). 
Chakravorty et al. (2014) found that a grid connection can increase 
non-agricultural incomes of rural households in India from 9% up 
to 28.6% (assuming a  higher quality of electricity). On the other 
hand, some studies clearly show that electricity consumption for 
connected households is extremely low, with limited penetration of 
electrical appliances (Cameron et al. 2016; Lee et al. 2017) and low 
quality of electricity (Chakravorty et al. 2014). The implementation 
of appropriate policies to overcome bureaucratic red tape, low 
reliability, and credit constraints, is necessary for maximising the 
social benefits of electrification.
9.8.5 Economic Implications of Mitigation Actions
9.8.5.1 Buildings-related Labour Productivity 
Low-carbon buildings, and particularly well-designed, operated and 
maintained high-performance buildings with adequate ventilation, 
may result in productivity gains and improve the competitiveness of the 
economy through three different pathways (MacNaughton et al. 2015; 
European Commission 2016; Niemelä et al. 2017; Mofidi and Akbari 
2017; Thema et al. 2017; Bleyl et al. 2019): (i) increasing the amount of 
active time available for productive work by reducing the absenteeism 
from work due to illness, the presenteeism (i.e., working with illness 
or working despite being ill), and the inability to work due to chronic 
diseases caused by the poor indoor environment; (ii) improving the 
indoor air quality and thermal comfort of non-residential buildings, 
which can result in better mental well-being of the employees and 
increased workforce performance; and (iii) reducing the school 
absenteeism due to better indoor environmental conditions, which 
may enhance the future earnings ability of the students and restrict the 
parents absenteeism due to care-taking of sick children.
Productivity gains due to increased amount of active time for work 
is directly related to acute and chronic health benefits attributed to 
climate mitigation actions in buildings (Section 9.8.2.2). The bulk of 
studies quantifying the impact of energy efficiency on productivity 
focus on acute health effects. Proper ventilation in buildings is of 
particular importance and can reduce absenteeism due to sick days 
by 0.6–1.9 days per  person per  year (MacNaughton et  al. 2015; 
Ben-David et al. 2017; Thema et al. 2017). In a pan-European study, 
(Chatterjee and Ürge-Vorsatz 2018) showed that deep energy 
retrofits in residential buildings may increase the number of active 
days by 1.78–5.27 (with an average of 3.09) per year and person 
who has actually shifted to a  deep retrofitted building. Similarly, 
the interventions in the non-residential buildings result in increased 
active days between 0.79 and 2.43 (with an average of 1.4) per year 
and person shifted to deeply retrofitted non-residential buildings. 
As regards improvements in workforce performance due to improved 
indoor conditions (i.e., air quality, thermal comfort, etc.), (Kozusznik et al. 
2019) conducted a systematic review on whether the implementation 
of energy efficient interventions in office buildings influence well-being 
and job performance of employees. Among the 34 studies included in this review, 31 found neutral to positive effects of green buildings on 
productivity and only 3 studies indicated detrimental outcomes for 
office occupants in terms of job performance. Particularly longitudinal 
studies, which observe and compare the office users’ reactions over 
time in conventional and green buildings, show that green buildings 
have neutral to positive effects on occupants well-being and work 
performance (Thatcher and Milner 2016; Candido et al. 2019; Kozusznik 
et al. 2019). Bleyl et al. (2019) estimated that deep energy retrofits in 
office buildings in Belgium would generate a workforce performance 
increase of EUR10.4 to EUR20.8 m–2 renovated. In Europe every 
1°C reduction in overheating during the summer period increases 
students learning performance by 2.3% and workers performance in 
office buildings by 3.6% (Kockat et al. 2018b). Considering the latter 
indicator, it was estimated that by reducing overheating across Europe, 
the overall performance of the workers in office buildings can increase 
by 7–12% (Kockat et al. 2018b).
9.8.5.2 Enhanced Asset Values of Energy Efficient Buildings
A significant number of studies confirm that homes with high energy 
efficiency and/or green features are sold at higher prices than 
conventional, low energy efficient houses. A review of 15 studies 
from 12 different countries showed that energy efficient dwellings 
have a  price premium ranging between 1.5% and 28%, with 
a median estimated at 7.8%, for the highest energy efficient category 
examined in each case study compared to reference houses with 
the same characteristics but lower energy efficiency (the detailed 
results of this review are presented in Supplementary Material 
Table 9.SM.5). In a given real estate market, the higher the energy 
efficiency of dwellings compared to conventional housing, the higher 
their selling prices. However, a  number of studies show that this 
premium is largely realised during resale transactions and is smaller 
or even negative in some cases immediately after the completion 
of the construction (Deng and Wu 2014; Yoshida and Sugiura 2015). 
A relatively lower number of studies (also included in Supplementary 
Material Table 9.SM.5) show that energy efficiency and green features 
have also a positive effect on rental prices of dwellings (Hyland et al. 
2013; Cajias et al. 2019), but this is weaker compared to sales prices, 
and in a developing country even negative as green buildings, which 
incorporate new technologies such as central air conditioning, are 
associated with higher electricity consumption (Zheng et al. 2012). 
Regarding non-residential buildings, (European Commission 2016) 
reviewed a  number of studies showing that buildings with high 
energy efficiency or certified with green certificates present higher 
sales prices by 5.2–35%, and higher rents by 2.5–11.8%. More 
recent studies in relation to those included in the review confirm 
these results (Mangialardo et  al. 2018; Ott and Hahn 2018) or 
project even higher premiums. Chegut et  al. (2014) found that 
green certification in the London office market results in a premium 
of 19.7% for rents. On the other hand, in Australia, a review study 
showed mixed evidence regarding price differentials emerged as 
a  function of energy performance of office buildings (Acil Allen 
Consulting 2015). Other studies have shown that energy efficiency 
and green certifications have been associated with lower default 
rates for commercial mortgages (Wallace et al. 2018; An and Pivo 
2020; Mathew et al. 2021).
Buildings  Chapter 99More generally, (Giraudet 2020) based on a  meta-analysis of 
several studies, showed that the capitalisation of energy efficiency is 
observed in building sales and rental (even in the absence of energy 
performance certificates), but the resulting market equilibrium can 
be considered inefficient as rented dwellings are less energy efficient 
than owner-occupied ones.
9.8.5.3 Macroeconomic Effects 
Investments required for the implementation of mitigation actions, 
create, mainly in the short-run, increase in the economic output 
and employment in sectors delivering energy efficiency services and 
products, which are partially counterbalanced by less investments 
and  lower production in other parts of the economy (Yushchenko 
and Patel 2016; European Commission 2016; Thema et al. 2017; US 
EPA 2018) (see also Cross-Working Group Box 1 in Chapter 3). The 
magnitude of these impacts depends on the structure of the economy, 
the extent to which energy saving technologies are produced 
domestically or imported from abroad, but also from the growth 
cycle of the economy with the benefits being maximised when the 
related investments are realised in periods of economic recession 
(Mirasgedis et  al. 2014; Yushchenko and Patel 2016; Thema et  al. 
2017). Particularly in developing countries if the mitigation measures 
and other interventions to improve energy access (Figure 9.19) are 
carried out by locals, the impact on economy, employment and social 
well-being will be substantial (Mills 2016; Lehr et al. 2016). As many 
of these programs are carried out with foreign assistance funds, it is 
essential that the funds be spent in-country to the full extent possible, 
while some portion of these funds would need to be devoted to 
institution building and especially training. (Mills 2016) estimated 
that a market transformation from inefficient and polluting fuel-based 
lighting to solar-LED systems to fully serve the 112 million households 
that currently lack electricity access will create directly 2 million new 
jobs in these developing countries, while the indirect effects could 
be even greater. IEA (2020a) estimated that 9–30 jobs would be 
generated for every million dollars invested in building retrofits or 
in construction of new energy efficient buildings (gross direct and 
indirect employment), with the highest employment intensity rates 
occurring in developing countries. Correspondingly, 7–16 jobs 
would be created for every million dollars spent in purchasing highly 
efficient and connected appliances, while expanding clean cooking 
through LPG could create 16–75 direct local jobs per million dollars 
invested. Increases in product and employment attributed to energy 
efficiency investments also affect public budgets by increasing 
income and business taxation, reducing unemployment benefits, 
and so on. Thema et al. (2017), thus mitigating the impact on public 
deficit of subsidising energy saving measures (Mikulić et al. 2016). 
Furthermore, energy savings due to the implementation of mitigation 
actions will result, mainly in the long-run, in increased disposable 
income for households, which in turn may be spent to buy other 
goods and services, resulting in economic development, creation of 
new permanent employment and positive public budget implications 
(IEA 2014; Thema et al. 2017; US EPA 2018). According to Anderson 
et  al. (2014), the production of these other goods and services is 
usually more labour-intensive compared to energy production, 
resulting in net employment benefits of about 8 jobs per  million dollars of consumer bill savings in the US. These effects may again 
have a  positive impact on public budgets. Furthermore, reduced 
energy consumption on a large scale is likely to have an impact on 
lower energy prices and hence on reducing the cost of production 
of various products, improving the productivity of the economy and 
enhancing security of energy supply (IEA 2014; Thema et al. 2017).
9.8.5.4 Energy Security 
GHG emission reduction actions in the sector of buildings affect energy 
systems by: (i) reducing the overall consumption of energy resources, 
especially fossil fuels; (ii) promoting the electrification of thermal 
energy uses; and (iii) enhancing distributed generation through the 
incorporation of RES and other clean and smart technologies in 
buildings. Increasing sufficiency, energy efficiency and penetration of 
RES result in improving the primary energy intensity of the economy 
and reducing dependence on fossil fuels, which for many countries 
are imported energy resources (Boermans et  al. 2015; Markovska 
et al. 2016; Thema et al. 2017). The electrification of thermal energy 
uses is expected to increase the demand for electricity in buildings, 
which in most cases can be reversed (at national or regional level) by 
promoting nearly zero energy new buildings and a deep renovation 
of the existing building stock (Boermans et  al. 2015; Couder and 
Verbruggen 2017). In addition, highly efficient buildings can keep 
the desired room temperature stable over a  longer period and 
consequently they have the capability to shift heating and cooling 
operation in time (Boermans et  al. 2015). These result in reduced 
peak demand, lower system losses and avoided generation and 
grid infrastructure investments. As a  significant proportion of the 
global population, particularly in rural and remote locations, still lack 
access to modern energy sources, renewables can be used to power 
distributed generation or micro-grid systems that enable peer-to-
peer energy exchange, constituting a crucial component to improve 
energy security for rural populations (Leibrand et al. 2019; Kirchhoff 
and Strunz 2019). For successful development of peer-to-peer micro-
grids, financial incentives to asset owners are critical for ensuring 
their willingness to share their energy resources, while support 
measures should be adopted to ensure that also non-asset holders 
can contribute to investments in energy generation and storage 
equipment and have the ability to sell electricity to others (Kirchhoff 
and Strunz 2019).
9.9 Sectoral Barriers and Policies
9.9.1 Barriers, Feasibility and Acceptance
Understanding the reasons why cost-effective investment in 
building energy efficiency are not taking place as expected by 
rational economic behaviour is critical to design effective policies 
for decarbonise the buildings (Cattano et al. 2013; Cattaneo 2019). 
Barriers depend from the actors (owner, tenant, utility, regulators, 
manufacturers, etc.), their role in energy efficiency project and the 
market, technology, financial economic, social, legal, institutional, 
regulatory and policy structures (Reddy 1991; Weber 1997; Sorrell 
et al. 2000; Reddy 2002; Sorrell et al. 2011; Cagno et al. 2012; Bardhan 
et al., 2014; Bagaini et al. 2020; Vogel et al. 2015; Khosla et al. 2017;

Buildings  Chapter 99Gupta et al. 2017). Barriers identified for the refurbishment of exiting 
building or construction of new efficient buildings includes: lack 
of high-performance products, construction methods, monitoring 
capacity, investment risks, policies intermittency, information gaps, 
principal agent problems (both tenant and landlord face disincentives 
to invest in energy efficiency), skills of the installers, lack of a trained 
and ready workforce, governance arrangements in collectively owned 
properties and behavioural anomalies (Gillingham and Palmer 2014; 
Buessler et al. 2017; Yang et al. 2019; Do et al. 2020; Dutt 2020; Song 
et al. 2020). A better understanding of behavioural barriers (Frederiks 
et al. 2015) is essential to design effective policies to decarbonise 
the building sector. Energy efficiency in buildings faces one 
additional problem: the sector is highly heterogeneous, with many 
different building types, sizes and operational uses. Energy efficiency 
investments do not take place in isolation but in competition with 
other priorities and as part of a  complex, protracted investment 
process (Cooremans 2011). Therefore, a focus on overcoming barriers 
is not enough for effective policy. Organisational context is important 
because the same barrier might have very different organisational 
effects and require very different policy responses (Mallaburn 
2018). Cross-Chapter Box  2 in Chapter  2 presents a  summary of 
methodologies for estimating the macro-level impact of policies on 
indices of GHG mitigation.
Reaching deep decarbonisation levels throughout the lifecycle 
of buildings depends on multidimensional criteria for assessing 
the feasibility of mitigation measures, including criteria related to 
geophysical, environmental-ecological, technological, economic, 
socio-cultural and institutional dimensions. An assessment of 

indicates whether a specific factor, within broader dimensions, acts 
as a barrier or helps enabling such mitigation measures (Figure 9.20, 
Supplementary Material Table  9.SM.6, and Annex II.11). Although 
mitigation measures are aggregated in the assessment of Figure 9.20 
and feasibility results can differ for more specific measures, generally 
speaking, the barriers to mitigation measures in buildings are few, 
sometimes including technological and socio-cultural challenges. 
However, many co-benefits could help enable mitigation in the 
buildings sector. For instance, many measures can have positive 
effects on the environment, health and well-being, and distributional 
potential, all of which can boost their feasibility. The feasibility of 
mitigation measures varies significantly according to socio-economic 
differences across and within countries.
9.9.2 Rebound Effects
In the buildings sector energy efficiency improvements and promotion 
of cleaner fuels can lead to all types of rebound effects,  while 
sufficiency measures lead only to indirect and secondary effects 
(Chitnis et  al. 2013). The consideration of the rebound effects as 
a behavioural economic response of the consumers to cheaper energy 
services can only partially explain the gap between the expected 
and actual energy savings (Galvin and Sunikka-Blank 2017). The 
prebound effect, a term used to describe the situation where there 
is a  significant difference between expected and observed energy 
consumption of non-refurbished buildings, is usually implicated in high rebound effects upon retrofitting (Teli et  al. 2016; Calì et  al. 
2016; Galvin and Sunikka-Blank 2017). The access for all to modern 
energy services such as heating and cooling is one of the well-being 
objectives governments aim for. However, ensuring this access leads 
to an increase of energy demand which is considered as a rebound 
effect by (Chitnis et al. 2013; Orea et al. 2015; Poon 2015; Teli et al. 
2016; Seebauer 2018; Sorrell et  al. 2018; Berger and Höltl 2019). 
Aydin et al. (2017) found that in the Netherlands the rebound effect 
for the lowest wealth quantile is double compared to the highest 
wealth quantile. Similar, energy access in developing countries leads 
to an increase consumption compared to very low baselines which 
is considered by some authors as rebound (Copiello 2017). On the 
other hand, in households whose members have a  higher level of 
education and/or strong environmental values, the rebound is lower 
(Seebauer 2018).
Rebound effects in the building sector could be a co-benefit, in cases 
where the mechanisms involved provide faster access to affordable 
energy and/or contribute to improved social well-being, or a trade-off, to 
the extent that the external costs of the increased energy consumption 
exceed the welfare benefits of the increased  energy service 
consumption (Chan and Gillingham 2015; Borenstein 2015; Galvin 
and Sunikka-Blank 2017; Sorrell et al. 2018). In cases where rebound 
effects are undesirable, appropriate policies could be implemented for 
their mitigation. 
There is great variation in estimates of the direct and indirect 
rebound effects, which stems from the end-uses included in the 
analysis, differences in definitions and methods used to estimate 
the rebound effects, the quality of the data utilised, the period of 
analysis and the geographical area in consideration (International 
Risk Governance Council 2013; Galvin 2014; Gillingham et al. 2016). 
Several studies examined in the context of this assessment (see 
Supplementary Material Table 9.SM.7) showed that direct rebound 
effects for residential energy consumption, which includes heating, 
are significant and range between –9% and 127%. The direct 
rebound effects for energy services other than heating may be lower 
(Chen et al. 2018; Sorrell et al. 2018). The rebound effects may be 
reduced with the time as the occupants learn how to optimally use 
the systems installed in energy renovated buildings (Calì et al. 2016) 
and seem to be lower in the case of major renovations leading to 
NZEB (Corrado et al. 2016). The combined direct and indirect or the 
indirect only rebound effects were found to range between –2% 
and 80%, with a  median at 12% (see Supplementary Material 
Table 9.SM.7). In non-residential buildings the rebound effects may 
be smaller, as the commercial sector is characterised by lower price 
elasticities of energy demand, while the comfort level in commercial 
buildings before renovation is likely to be better compared to 
residential buildings (Qiu 2014).
9.9.3 Policy Packages for the Decarbonisation 
of Buildings
There is no single energy efficiency policy (Wiese et al. 2018) able to 
decarbonise the building sector, but a  range of polices are needed, often 
included in a policy package (Kern et al., 2017; Rosenow et al. 2017) 
Chapter 9 Buildings9to enhance robustness against risks and uncertainties in both short 
and long-term and addressing the different stakeholder perspectives 
(Forouli et al. 2019; Nikas et al. 2020; Doukas and Nikas 2020). This is 
due to: the many barriers; the different types of buildings (residential, 
non-residential, etc.); the different socio-economic groups of the 
population (social housing, informal settlement, etc.); the country 
development status; the local climate (cooling and/or heating), 
ownership structure (tenant or owner), the age of buildings. Effective 
policy packages include mandatory standards, codes, the provision of 
information, carbon pricing, financing, and technical assistance for 
end-users. Important element related to policy packages is whether 
the policies reinforce each other or diminish the impact of individual 
policies, due to policy ‘overcrowding’. Examples are the EU policy 
package for efficiency in buildings (Rosenow and Bayer 2017; BPIE, 
2020; Economidou et al. 2020) and China goal of 10 million m2 NZEB 
during the 13th Five-Year Plan, presented in the Supplementary 
Material (Supplementary Material Section 9.SM.4) (see also Cross-
Chapter Box  10 in Chapter  14 for integrated policymaking for 
sector transitions).
Revisions in tenant and condominium law are necessary for reducing 
disincentives between landlord and tenant or between multiple 
owners, these acts alone cannot incentivise them to uptake an energy 
efficiency upgrade in a property (Economidou and Serrenho, 2019). 
A package addressing split incentives include regulatory measures, 
information measures, labels, individual metering rules and financial 
models designed to distribute costs and benefits to tenants and 
owners in a  transparent and fair way (Bird and Hernández 2012; 
Economidou and Bertoldi 2015; Castellazi et  al. 2017). A more 
active engagement of building occupants in energy saving practices, 
the development of agreements benefitting all involved actors, 
acknowledgement of real energy consumption and establishment of 
cost recovery models attached to the property instead of the owner 
are useful measures to address misalignments between actors. 
In Developed Countries policy packages are targeted to increase 
the number and depth of renovations of existing building, while for 
developing countries policies focus on new construction, including 
regulatory measures and incentives, while carbon pricing would be 
more problematic unless there is a strong recycling of the revenues. 
Building energy codes and labels could be based on LCA emissions, 
rather than energy consumption during the use phase of buildings, as 
it is the case in Switzerland and Finland (Kuittinen and Häkkinen 2020).
Policy packages should also combine sufficiency, efficiency, and 
renewable energy instruments for buildings, for example some 
national building energy codes already include minimum requirements 
for the use of renewable energy in buildings.
9.9.3.1 Sufficiency and Efficiency Policies
Recently the concept of sufficiency complementary to energy 
efficiency has been introduced in policy making (Brischke et al. 2015; 
Hewitt 2018; Thomas et al. 2019; Bertoldi 2020; Saheb 2021) (Box 9.1). 

planetary boundaries.Lorek and Spangenberg (2019b) investigated the limitations of the 
theories of planned behaviour and social practice and proposed an 
approach combining both theories resulting in a heuristic sufficiency 
policy2 tool. Lorek and Spangenberg (2019b) showed that increased 
living area per  person counteracts efficiency gains in buildings 
and called for sufficiency policy instruments to efficiency by limit 
building size. This could be achieved via mandatory and prescriptive 
measures, for example, progressive building energy codes (IEA 2013), 
or financial penalties in the form of property taxation (e.g., non-linear 
and progressive taxation), or with mandatory limits on building size 
per  capita. Heindl and Kanschik (2016) suggested that voluntary 
policies promoting sufficiency and proposed that sufficiency should be 
‘integrated in a more comprehensive normative framework related to 
welfare and social justice’. Alcott highlighted that in sufficiency there is 
a loss of utility or welfare (Alcott, 2008). Thomas et al. (2019) described 
some of the possible policies, some based on the sharing economy 
principles, for examples co-sharing space, public authorities facilitating 
the exchange house between young and expanding families with elderly 
people, with reduced need for space. Policies for sufficiency include 
land-use and urban planning policies. Berril et  al. (2021) proposed 
removing policies, which support supply of larger home typologies, for 
example, single-family home or local land-use regulations restricting 
construction of multifamily buildings. In non-residential building, 
sufficiency could be implemented through the sharing economy, for 
example with flexible offices space with hot-desking. 
Scholars have identified the ‘energy efficiency gap’ (Hirst and 
Brown 1990; Jaffe and Stavins 1994; Alcott and Greenstone 2012; 
Gillingham and Palmer 2014; Stadelmann 2017) and policies to 
overcome it. Markandya et  al. (2015) and Shen et  al. (2016) have 
classified energy efficiency policies in three broad categories: the 
command and control (e.g.,  mandatory building energy codes; 
mandatory appliances standards, etc.); price instruments (e.g., taxes, 
subsides, tax deductions, credits, permits and tradable obligations, 
etc.); and information instruments (e.g., labels, energy audits, smart 
meters and feed-back, etc.). Based on the EU Energy Efficiency 
Directive, the MURE and the IEA energy efficiency policy databases 
(Bertoldi and Mosconi 2020), Bertoldi (2020) proposed six policy 
categories: regulatory, financial and fiscal; information and 
awareness; qualification, training and quality assurance; market-
based instruments: voluntary action. The categorisation of energy 
efficiency policies used in this chapter is aligned with the taxonomy 
used in Chapter 13, sub-section 13.5.1 (economic or market-based 
instruments, regulatory instruments, and other policies). However, 
the classification used here is more granular in order to capture the 
complexity of end-use energy efficiency and buildings. 
1. Regulatory instruments 
Building energy codes. Several scholars highlighted the key 
role of mandatory building energy codes and minimum energy 
performance requirements for buildings (Enker and Morrison 2017). 
Wang et al. (2019) finds that, ‘Building energy efficiency standards 
(BEES) are one of the most effective policies to reduce building 
Buildings  Chapter 99energy consumption, especially in the case of the rapid urbanisation 
content in China’. Ex post policy evaluation shows that stringent 
buildings’ codes reduce energy consumption in buildings and CO 2 
emissions and are cost-effective (Aroonruengsawat 2012; Jacobsen 
and Kotchen 2013; Scott et  al. 2015; Levinson 2016; Kotchen 
2017; Yu et  al. 2017; Yu et  al. 2018; Aydin and Brounen 2019). 
Progressive building energy codes include requirements on efficiency 
improvement but also on sufficiency and share of renewables (Clune 
et  al. 2012; Rosenberg et  al., 2017) and on embodied emissions 
(Schwarz et al. 2020), for example the 2022 ASHRAE Standard 90.1 
includes prescriptive on-site renewable energy requirements for non-
residential building. Evans et  al. (2017; 2018) calls for strengthen 
the compliance checks with efficiency requirements or codes when 
buildings are in operation and highlighted the need for enforcement 
of building energy codes to achieve the estimate energy and carbon 
savings recommending actions to improve enforcements, including 
institutional capacity and adequate resources.
Evans et  al. (2017; 2018) identified strengthening the compliance 
checks with codes when buildings are in operation and the need 
for enforcement of building energy codes in order to achieve the 
estimate energy and carbon savings, recommending actions to 
improve enforcements, including institutional capacity and adequate 
resources. Another important issue to be addressed by policies is the 
‘Energy Performance Gap’ (EPG), that is, the gap between design and 
policy intent and actual outcomes. Regulatory and market support 
regimes are based on predictive models (Cohen and Bordass 2015) 
with general assumptions about building types, the way they are 
used and are not covering all energy consumption. In the perspective 
of moving towards net zero carbon, it is important that policy capture 
and address the actual in-use performance of buildings (Gupta et al. 
2015; Gupta and Kotopouleas 2018). Outcome-based codes are 
increasingly important because they overcome some limitations of 
prescriptive building energy codes, which typically do not regulate 
all building energy uses or do not regulate measured operational 
energy use in buildings. Regulating all loads, especially plug and 
process loads, is important because they account for an increasingly 
large percentage of total energy use as building envelope and space-
conditioning equipment are becoming more efficient (Denniston 
et al. 2011; Colker 2012; Enker and Morrison 2020).
Building codes could also foster the usage of wood and timber as 
a construction in particular for multi-storey buildings and in the long 
term penalise carbon intensive building materials (Ludwig 2019) with 
policies based on environmental performance assessment of buildings 
and the ‘wood first’ principle (Ludwig 2019; Ramage et al. 2017).
Retro-commissioning is a cost-effective process to periodically check 
the energy performance of existing building and assure energy savings 
are maintained overtime (Kong et al. 2019; Ssembatya et al. 2021).
In countries with low rate of new construction, it is important to 
consider mandatory building energy codes for existing buildings, but 
this may also be relevant for countries with high new construction, 
as they will have soon a large existing building stock. The EU has 
requirements already in place when building undergo a  major 
renovation (Economidou et  al. 2020). Countries considering mandatory regulations for existing buildings include Canada, the 
US (specific cities), China and Singapore. Policies include mandating 
energy retrofits for low performances existing buildings, when sold 
or rented. In countries with increasing building stock, in particular in 
developing countries, policies are more effective when targeting new 
buildings (Kamal et al. 2019).
NZEBs definitions are proposed by (Marszal et al. 2011; Deng and Wu 
2014; Zhang and Zhou 2015; Williams et al. 2016; Wells et al. 2018), 
covering different geographical areas, developing and Developed 
Countries, and both existing buildings and new buildings. In 2019, 
China issued the national standard Technical Standard for Nearly 
Zero Energy Building (MoHURD, 2019). California has also adopted 
a  building energy code mandating for NZEBs for new residential 
buildings in 2020 and 2030 for commercial buildings (Feng et  al. 
2019). Several countries have adopted targets, roadmaps or 
mandatory building energy codes requiring net zero energy buildings 
(NZEBs) for some classes of new buildings (Feng et al. 2019). 
Building labels and Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs). 
Buildings labels are an important instrument, with some limitations. 
Li et  al. (2019b) reviewed the EU mandatory Energy Performance 
Certificates for buildings and proposed several measures to make the 
EPC more effective in driving the markets towards low consumption 
buildings. Some authors have indicated that the EPC based on the 
physical properties of the buildings (asset rating) may be misleading 
due to occupancy behaviour (Cohen and Bordass 2015) and 
calculation errors (Crawley et al. 2019). Control authorities can have 
a large impact on the quality of the label (Mallaburn 2018). Labels 
can also include information on the GHG embedded in building 
material or be based on LCA.
US EPA Energy Star and NABERS (Gui and Gou, 2020) are building 
performance labels based on performance, not on modelled energy 
use. Singapore has mandatory building energy labels, as do many 
cities in the US, while India and Brazil have mandatory labels for 
public buildings.
Mandatory energy performance disclosure and benchmarking of 
building energy consumption is a  powerful policy instrument in 
particular for non-residential buildings (Trencher et  al. 2016) and 
could be more accurate than energy audits. Gabe (2016) showed that 
mandatory disclosure is more effective than voluntary disclosure. 
Some US cities (e.g., New York) have adopted Emissions Performance 
Standards for buildings, capping CO2 emissions. Accurate statistics 
related to energy use are very important for reducing GHG in building 
sector. In 2015, the Republic of Korea stablished the National 
Building Energy Integrated Management System, where building 
data and energy consumption information are collected for policy 
development and public information.
Energy audits. Energy audits, help to overcome the information 
barriers to efficiency investments, in particular buildings owned 
or occupied by small companies (Kalantzis and Revoltella, 2019). 
In the EU energy audits are mandatory for large companies under 
the Energy Efficiency Directive (Nabitz and Hirzel 2019), with some 
EU Member States having a  long experience with energy audits, 
Chapter 9 Buildings9as part of national voluntary agreements with the private sector 
(Rezessy and Bertoldi 2011; Cornelis 2019). Singapore has adopted 
mandatory audit for buildings (Shen et  al. 2016). In the United 
States, several cities have adopted energy informational policies in 
recent years, including mandatory buildings audits (Trencher et  al. 
2016; Kontokosta et al. 2020). The State of New York has in place 
a subsidised energy audit for residential building since 2010 (Boucher 
et al. 2018). It is important to assure the training of auditors and the 
quality of the audit.
Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPSs). Mandatory 
minimum efficiency standards for building technical equipment 
and appliances (e.g., HVAC, appliances, ICT, lighting, etc.) is a very 
common, tested and successful policy in most of the OECD countries 
(e.g., EU, US, Canada, Australia, etc.) for improving energy efficiency 
(Scott et al. 2015; Wu et al. 2019; Sonnenschein et al. 2019). Brucal 
and Roberts (2019) showed that efficiency standards reduce product 
price. McNeil et  al. (2019) highlighted how efficiency standards 
will help developing countries in reducing the power peak demand 
by a  factor of two, thus reducing large investment costs in new 
generation, transmission, and distribution networks. Mandatory 
standards have been implemented also other large economies, for 
example, Russia, Brazil, India, South Africa, China, Ghana, Kenya and 
Malaysia (Salleh et al. 2019), with an increase in the uptake also in 
developing countries, for example, Ghana, Kenya, Tunisia, and so on. 
In Japan, there is a successful voluntary programme the Top Runner, 
with similar results of mandatory efficiency standards (Inoue and 
Matsumoto 2019).
Appliance energy labelling. Mandatory energy labelling schemes 
for building technical equipment and appliances are very often 
implemented together with minimum efficiency standards, with the 
mandatory standard pushing the market towards higher efficiency 
and the label pulling the market (Bertoldi, 2019). OECD countries, 
and many developing countries (for example China, Ghana, Kenya, 
India, South Africa, etc.) (Chunekar 2014; Diawuo et  al. 2018; 
Issock et al. 2018) have adopted mandatory energy labelling. Other 
labelling schemes are of voluntary nature, for example, the Energy 
Star programme in the US (Ohler et  al. 2020), which covers many 
different appliances.
Information campaign. Provision of information (e.g.,  public 
campaigns, targeted technical information, etc.) is a common policy 
instrument to change end-user behaviour. Many authors agree 
that the effect of both targeted and general advertisement and 
campaigns have a short lifetime and the effects tend to decrease 
over time (Reiss and White 2008; Simcock et  al. 2014; Diffney 
et al. 2013). The meta-analysis carried out by (Delmas et al. 2013) 
showed that energy audits and personal information were the 
most effective followed by providing individuals with comparisons 
with their peers’ energy use including ‘non-monetary, information-
based’ (Delmas et al. 2013). An effective approach integrates the 
social norm as the basis for information and awareness measures 
on energy behaviour (Schultz et al. 2007; Gifford 2011). Information 
is more successful when it inspires and engages people: how 
people feel about a given situation often has a potent influence 
on their decisions (Slovic and Peters 2006). The message needs to be carefully selected and kept as simple as possible focusing on 
the following: entertain, engage, embed and educate (Dewick and 
Owen 2015). 
Energy consumption feedback with smart meters, smart billing and 
dedicated devices and apps is another instrument recently exploited 
to reduce energy consumption (Karlin et  al. 2015; Buchanan et  al. 
2018; Zangheri et  al. 2019) very often coupled with contest-based 
interventions or norm-based interventions (Bergquist et  al. 2019). 
Hargreaves et al. (2018) proposes five core types of action to reduce 
energy use: turn it off, use it less, use it more carefully, improve its 
performance, and replace it/use an alternative. According to Aydin 
et  al. (2018), technology alone will not be enough to achieve the 
desired energy savings due to the rebound effect. The lack of interest 
from household occupants, confusing feedback message and difficulty 
to relate it to practical intervention, overemphasis on financial 
savings and the risks of ‘fallback effects’ where energy use returns 
to previous levels after a  short time or rebound effects has been 
pointed out (Buchanan et al. 2015) as the main reasons for the failing 
of traditional feedback. Labanca and Bertoldi (2018) highlight the 
current limitations of policies for energy conservation and suggests 
complementary policy approach based on social practices theories. 
2. Market-based instruments
Carbon allowances. A number of authors (Raux et al. 2015; Fan et al. 
2016; Fawcett and Parag 2017; Li et al. 2015, 2018; Marek et al. 2018; 
Wadud and Chintakayala 2019) have investigated personal carbon 
allowances introduced previously (Ayres 1995; Fleming 1997; Raux 
and Marlot 2005; Bristow et al. 2010; Fawcett 2010; Starkey 2012). 
Although there is not yet any practical implementation of this policy, 
it offers an alternative to carbon taxes, although there are some 
practical issues to be solved before it could be rolled out. Recently the 
city of Lahti in Finland has introduced a personal carbon allowance 
in the transport sector (Kuokkanen et  al. 2020). Under this policy 
instrument governments allocate (free allocation, but allowances 
could also be auctioned) allowances to cover the carbon emission for 
one year, associated with energy consumption. Trade of allowances 
between people can be organised. Personal carbon allowances can 
also foster renewable energies (energy consumption without carbon 
emissions) both in the grid and in buildings (e.g.,  solar thermal). 
Personal carbon allowances can make the carbon price more explicit 
to consumers, allowing them to know from the market value of each 
allowance (e.g.,  1 kg of CO 2). This policy instrument will shift the 
responsibility to the individual. Some categories may have limited 
ability to change their carbon budget or to be engaged by this policy 
instruments. In addition, in common with many other environmental 
policies the distributional effects have to be assessed carefully as 
this policy instrument may favour well off people able to purchase 
additional carbon allowances or install technologies that reduce their 
carbon emissions (Burgess 2016; Wang et al. 2017).
The concept of carbon allowances or carbon budget can also be 
applied to buildings, by assigning a  yearly CO 2 emissions budget 
to each building. This policy would be a less complex than personal 
allowances as buildings have metered or billed energy sources 
(e.g.,  gas, electricity, delivered heat, heating oil, etc.). The scheme 
Buildings  Chapter 99stimulates investments in energy efficiency and on-site renewable 
energies and energy savings resulting from behaviour by buildings 
occupant. For commercial buildings, similar schemes were 
implemented in the UK CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme (closed in 
2019) or the Tokyo Metropolitan Carbon and Trade Scheme (Nishida 
and Hua 2011; Bertoldi et  al. 2013a). Since 2015 the Republic of 
Korea implemented an Emission Trading Scheme, covering buildings 
(Park and Hong 2014; Lee and Yu 2017; Narassimhan et al. 2018). 
More recently under the New York Climate Mobilization Act enacted 
in 2019 New York City Local Law 97 established ‘Carbon Allowances’ 
for large buildings (Spiegel-Feld 2019; Lee 2020). 
Public money can be used to reward and give incentives to energy 
saved, as a result of technology implementation, and/or as a result of 
energy conservation and sufficiency (Eyre 2013; Bertoldi et al. 2013b; 
Prasanna et al. 2018). This can be seen as a core feature of the Energy 
Savings Feed-in Tariff (ES-FiT). The ES-FiT is a  performance-based 
subsidy, whereby actions undertaken by end-users  – for example, 
investments in energy efficiency technology measures – are awarded 
based on the real energy savings achieved.
Utilities programmes, energy efficiency resource standard 
and energy efficiency obligations. Ratepayer-funded efficiency 
programmes, energy efficiency obligations, energy efficiency resource 
standards and white certificates have been introduced in some EU 
Member States, in several US States, Australia, South Korea and 
Brazil (Bertoldi et al. 2013a; Palmer et al. 2013; Brennan and Palmer 
2013; Giraudet and Finon 2015; Wirl 2015; Rosenow and Bayer 2017; 
Aldrich and Koerner 2018; Choi et al. 2018a; Fawcett and Darby 2018; 
Fawcett et al. 2019; Nadel, 2019; Sliger and Colburn, 2019; Goldman 
et  al. 2020). This policy instrument helps in improving energy 
efficiency in buildings, but there is no evidence that it can foster deep 
renovations of existing buildings. Recently this policy instrument has 
been investigated is some non-OECD countries such as Turkey, where 
white certificates could deliver energy savings with some limitations 
(Duzgun and Komurgoz 2014) and UAE, as a useful instrument to 
foster energy efficiency in buildings (Friedrich and Afshari 2015). 
Another similar market based instrument is the energy saving 
auction mechanism implemented in some US states, Switzerland, 
and in Germany (Langreder et al. 2019; Rosenow et al. 2019; Thomas 
and Rosenow 2020). Energy efficiency projects participate in auctions 
for energy savings based on the cost of the energy saved and receive 
a financial incentive, if successful.
Energy or carbon taxes. Energy and/or carbon taxes are a climate 
policy, which can help in reducing energy consumption (Sen and 
Vollebergh 2018) and manage the rebound effect (Font Vivanco 
et al. 2016; Peng et al. 2019; Freire-González 2020; Bertoldi 2020). 
The carbon tax has been adopted mainly in OECD countries and in 
particular in EU Member States (Sen and Vollebergh 2018; Hájek 
et al. 2019; Bertoldi 2020). There is high agreement that carbon taxes 
can be effective in reducing CO 2 emissions (Andersson 2017; IPCC 
2018; Hájek et al. 2019). It is hard to define the optimum level of 
taxation in order to achieve the desired level of energy consumption 
or CO 2 emission reduction (Weisbach et al. 2009). As for other energy 
efficiency policy distributional effect and equity considerations have 
to be carefully considered and mitigated (Borozan 2019). High energy prices tend to reduce the energy consumption particularly in less 
affluent households, and thus attention is needed in order to avoid 
unintended effects such as energy poverty. Bourgeois et al. (2021) 
showed that using carbon tax revenue to finance energy efficiency 
investment reduces fuel poverty and increases cost-effectiveness. 
(Giraudet et  al. 2021) assessed the cost-effectiveness of various 
energy efficiency policies in France, concluding that a carbon tax is the 
most effective. In particular, revenues could be invested in frontline 
services that can provide a  range of support  – including advising 
householders on how to improve their homes. Hence, the introduction 
of a carbon tax can be neutral or even positive to the economy, as 
investments in clean technologies generate additional revenues. 
In addition, in the long term, a  carbon/energy tax could gradually 
replace the tax on labour reducing labour cost (e.g., the example of 
the German Eco-tax), thus helping to create additional jobs in the 
economy. In literature, this is known as double dividend (Murtagh 
et al. 2013; Freire-González and Ho 2019). Urban economic researches 
(Creutzig 2014; Borck and Brueckner 2018; Rafaj et al. 2018) have 
highlighted that higher carbon price would translate in incentives for 
citizens to live closer to the city centre, which often means less floor 
space, less commuting distance and thus reduced emissions. Xiang 
and Lawley (2019) indicated that the carbon tax in British Columbia 
substantially reduced residential natural gas consumption. Saelim 
(2019) showed that simulated carbon tax on residential consumption 
in Thailand will have a low impact on welfare and it will be slightly 
progressive. Lin and Li (2011) indicate that a carbon tax could reduce 
the energy consumption and boost the uptake of energy efficiency 
and renewable energies, while at the same time may impact social 
welfare and the competitiveness of industry. Solaymani (2017) 
showed that in Malaysia a tax with revenue recycling increases in 
the welfare of rural and urban households. Van Heerden et al. (2016) 
explored economic and environmental effects of the CO 2 tax in South 
Africa highlighting the negative impact on GDP . This negative impact 
of the carbon tax on GDP is, however, greatly reduced by the manner 
in which the tax revenue is recycled. National circumstances shall be 
taken into consideration in introducing energy taxes, considering the 
local taxation and energy prices context with regard to sustainable 
development, justice and equity.
A policy, which can have similar impact to a carbon tax and is the 
energy price/subsidy reform, which also involves raising energy 
prices. Energy price/subsidy reform reduces energy consumption and 
greenhouse gas emissions and encourages investment in energy 
efficiency (Coady et al. 2018; Aldubyan and Gasim, 2021). In a similar 
manner, government revenues from subsidies reforms can be used to 
mitigate the distributional impact on vulnerable population groups, 
including direct cash transfer programmes (Rentschler and Brazilian 
2017; Schaffitzel et al. 2020).
Taxes could also be used to penalise inefficient behaviour and favour 
the adoption of efficient behaviour and technologies. Taxes are used 
in some jurisdictions to promote energy efficient appliances with 
lower VAT. Similarly, the annual building/property tax (and also the 
purchase tax) could be based on the CO 2 emissions of the buildings, 
rather than on the value of the building. Tax credits are also an 
important subsidy for the renovation of buildings in France (Giraudet 
2020), Italy (Alberini and Bigano 2015) and other countries.
Chapter 9 Buildings99.9.4 Financing Mechanisms and Business Models 
for Reducing Energy Demand
Grants and subsidies are traditional financing instruments used by 
governments when optimal levels of investments cannot be fully 
supported by the market alone. They can partly help overcoming the 
upfront cost barrier as they directly fill an immediate financial gap 
and thus enable a temporary shift in the market (Newell et al. 2019). 
These forms of support are usually part of policy mixes including 
further fiscal and financial instruments such as feed-in tariffs and 
tax breaks (Polzin et al. 2019). Potential issues with subsidies are the 
limited availability of public financing, the stop and go due to annual 
budget and the competition with commercial financing.
Loans provide liquidity and direct access to capital important in deep 
renovation projects (Rosenow et al. 2014). There is empirical evidence 
(Giraudet et al. 2021), that banks make large profits on personal loans 
for renovation purposes. International financing institutions (IFIs) and 
national governments provided subsidies in public-private partnerships 
so that financial institutions can offer customers loans with attractive 
terms (Olmos et al. 2012). Loan guarantees are effective in reducing 
intervention borrowing costs (Soumaré and Lai 2016). Combination 
of grants and subsidised loans financed by IFIs could be an effective 
instrument together with guarantees. An important role in financing 
energy efficiency can be played by green banks, which are publicly 
capitalised entities set up to facilitate private investment in low-
carbon, including energy efficiency (Bahl 2012; Tu and Yen 2015; Linh 
and Anh 2017; Khan 2018). Green banks have been established at the 
national level (e.g., UK, Poland) and in the US at state and city level. 
Wholesaling of EE of loans and utilities programmes, are other important 
financing instruments. Another financing mechanism for building 
efficiency upgrades, mainly implemented so far in the US, is efficiency-
as-a-service under an energy services agreement (ESA), where the 
building owners or tenant pay to the efficiency service provider a charge 
based on realised energy savings without any upfront cost (Kim et al. 
2012; Bertoldi, 2020). ESA providers give performance guarantees 
assuming the risk that expected savings would occur (Bertoldi, 2020).
Energy Performance Contracting (EPC) is an agreement between 
a building owner and Energy Services Company (ESCO) for energy 
efficiency improvements. EPC is a  common financing vehicle for 
large buildings and it is well developed in several markets (Carvallo 
et al. 2015; Bertoldi and Boza Kiss, 2017; Stuart et al. 2018; Ruan 
et  al. 2018; Nurcahyanto et  al. 2020; Zheng et  al. 2021). Quality 
standards are a part of the EPC (Augustins et al. 2018). Guarantees 
can facilitate the provision of affordable and sufficient financing for 
ESCOs (Bullier and Milin 2013). The ESCO guarantees a certain level 
of energy savings and it shields the client from performance risk. The 
loan goes on the client’s balance sheet and the ESCO assumes full 
project performance risk (Deng et al. 2015). One of the limitations is 
on the depth of the energy renovation in existing buildings. According 
to (Giraudet et  al. 2018), EPC is effective at reducing information 
problems between contractors and investors. 
Energy efficient mortgages are mortgages that credits a home energy 
efficiency by offering preferential mortgage terms to extend existing mortgages to finance efficiency improvements. There are two types of 
energy mortgages: (i) the Energy Efficient Mortgages (EEMs), and (ii) the 
Energy Improvement Mortgages (EIMs), both can help in overcoming 
the main barriers to retrofit policies (Miu et  al. 2018). The success 
depends on the improved energy efficiency with a positive impact on 
property value and on the reduction of energy bills and the income 
increase in the household. In the EU, the EeMAP Initiative aims to create 
a standardised energy efficient mortgage template (Bertoldi et al. 2021).
On-bill financing is a mechanism that reduces first-cost barriers by 
linking repayment of energy efficiency investments to the utility 
bill and thereby allowing customers to pay back part or all costs of 
energy efficiency investments over time (Brown 2009). On-bill finance 
programmes can be categorised into: (i) on-bill loans (assignment of 
the obligation to the property) and (ii) on-bill tariffs (payment off in 
case of ownership transfer) (Eadson et  al. 2013). On-bill finance 
programmes can be more effective when set up as a service rather 
than a loan (Mundaca and Klocke 2018).
Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) is a  means of financing 
energy renovations and renewable energy through the use of specific 
bonds offered by municipal governments to investors (Mills 2016). 
Municipalities use the funds raised to loan money towards energy 
renovations in buildings. The loans are repaid over the assigned long 
term (15–20 years) via an annual assessment on their property tax 
bill (Kirkpatrick and Bennear 2014). This model has been subject 
to consumer protection concerns. Residential PACE programmes 
in California have been shown to increase PV deployment in 
jurisdictions that adopt these programs (Kirkpatrick and Bennear 
2014; Ameli et al. 2017). In US commercial buildings, PACE volumes 
and programs, however, continue to grow (Lee 2020). 
Revolving funds allow reducing investment requirements and 
enhancing energy efficiency investment impacts by recovering 
and reinvesting the savings generated (Setyawan 2014). Revolving 
fund could make retrofit cost-neutral in the long term and could 
also dramatically increase low carbon investments, including in 
developing countries (Gouldson et al. 2015).
Carbon finance, started under the Kyoto Protocol with the flexible 
mechanisms and further enhanced under the Paris Agreement 
(Michaelowa et al. 2019), is an activity based on ‘carbon emission rights’ 
and its derivatives (Liu et al. 2015a). Carbon finance can promote low-
cost emission reductions (Zhou and Li 2019). Under Emission Trading 
Schemes or other carbon pricing mechanisms, auctioning carbon 
allowances creates a new revenue stream. Revenues from auctioning 
could be used to finance energy efficiency projects in buildings with 
grants, zero interest loans or guarantees (Wiese et al. 2020).
Crowdfunding is a  new and rapidly growing form of financial 
intermediation that channels funds from investors to borrowers 
(individuals or companies) or users of equity capital (companies) 
without involving traditional financial organisations such as banks 
(Miller and Carriveau 2018). Typically, it involves internet-based 
platforms that link savers directly with borrowers (European Union 
2015). It can play a significant role at the start of a renewable and 
sustainable energy projects (Dilger et al. 2017).
Buildings  Chapter 99The One-Stop Shop (OSS) service providers for buildings energy 
renovations are organisations, consortia, projects, independent experts 
or advisors that usually cover the whole or large part of the customer 
renovation journey from information, technical assistance, structuring and 
provision of financial support, to the monitoring of savings (Mahapatra 
et al. 2019; Bertoldi 2021b). OSSs are transparent and accessible advisory 
tools from the client perspective and new, innovative business models 
from the supplier perspective (Boza-Kiss and Bertoldi 2018).
9.9.5 Policies Mechanisms for Financing for On-site 
Renewable Energy Generation
On-site renewable energy generation is a  key component for the 
building sector decarbonisation, complementing sufficiency and 
efficiency. Renewable energies (RES) technologies still face barriers 
due to the upfront investment costs, despite the declining price of 
some technologies, long pay-back period, unpredictable energy 
production, policy incertitude, architectural (in particular for built-in 
PV) and landscape considerations, technical regulations for access to 
the grid, and future electricity costs (Mah et al. 2018; Agathokleous 
and Kalogirou 2020). 
Several policy instruments for RES have been identified by scholars 
(Fouquet 2013; Azhgaliyeva et  al. 2018; Pitelis et  al. 2020): direct 
investments; feed-in tariffs; grants and subsidies; loans and taxes; 
(tradable) green certificates or renewable/clean energy portfolio 
standards; information and education; strategic planning; codes and 
standards; building codes; priority grid access; research, development 
and deployment and voluntary approaches. There are specific policies 
for renewable heating and cooling (Connor et al. 2013). In 2011, the 
UK introduced the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) support scheme 
(Balta-Ozkan et al. 2015; Connor et al. 2015). The RHI guarantee a fixed 
payment per unit of heat generated by a renewable heat technology 
for a specific contract duration (Yılmaz Balaman et al. 2019).
The most common implemented policy instruments are the feed-in 
tariffs (FiTs) and the Renewable/Energy Portfolio Standards (RPSs) (Xin-
gang et al. 2017a; Alizada 2018; Bergquist et al. 2020), with FiTs more 
suited for small scale generation. More than 60 countries and regions 
worldwide have implemented one of the two policies (Sun and Nie 2015). 
FiT is a price policy guaranteeing the purchase of energy generation at 
a specific fixed price for a fixed period (Barbosa et al. 2018; Xin-gang 
et al. 2020). RPS is a quantitative policy, which impose mandatory quota 
of RES generation to power generators (Xin-gang et al. 2020). 
A flat rate feed-in tariff (FiT) is a well-tested incentive adopted in many 
jurisdictions to encourage end-users to generate electricity from RES 
using rooftop and on-site PV systems (Pacudan 2018). More recently, 
there has been an increasing interest for dynamic FiTs taking into 
account electricity costs, hosting capacity, ambient temperature, and 
time of day (Hayat et al. 2019). Since 2014, EU Member States have 
been obligated to move from FiT to feed-in premium (FiTP) (Hortay 
and Rozner 2019); where a FiTP consist in a premium of top of the 
electricity market price. Lecuyer and Quirion (2019) argued that under 
uncertainty over electricity prices and renewable production costs a flat 
FiT results in higher welfare than a FiTP . One of the main concerns with FiT systems is the increasing cost of policies maintenance (Zhang et al. 
2018; Pereira da Silva et al. 2019; Roberts et al. 2019a). In Germany, 
the financial costs, passed on to consumers in the form a levy on the 
electricity price have increased substantially in recent years (Winter 
and Schlesewsky 2019) resulting in opposition to the FiT in particular 
by non-solar customers. A particular set up of the FiT encourage self-
consumption through net metering and net billing, which has a lower 
financial impact on electricity ratepayers compared with traditional 
FiTs (Pacudan 2018; Roberts et al. 2019b; Vence and Pereira 2019).
In some countries, for example, Australia (Duong et al. 2019), South 
Korea (Choi et al. 2018a), China (Yi et al. 2019), there was a transition 
from subsidies under the FiT to market-based mechanisms, such 
as RPSs and tendering. Compared with FiT, RPS (or Renewable 
Obligations) reduce the subsidy costs (Zhang et al. 2018). A number 
of scholars (Xin-gang et  al. 2017; Liu et  al. 2018a, 2019a) have 
highlighted the RPSs’ effectiveness in promoting the development of 
renewable energy. Other authors (Requate 2015; An et al. 2015) have 
presented possible negative impacts of RPSs. 
Both FiT and RPS can support the development of RES. Scholars 
compared the effectiveness of RPSs and FiTs with mix results and 
different opinions, with some scholars indicating the advantages of 
RPS (Ciarreta et al. 2014, 2017; Xin-gang et al. 2017), while Nicolini 
and Tavoni (2017) showed that in Italy FiTs are outperforming RPSs 
and Tradable Green Certificates (TGCs). García-Álvarez et  al. (2018) 
carried out an empirical assessment of FiTs and RPSs for PV systems 
energy in EU over the period 2000–2014 concluding that that FiTs 
have a  significant positive impact on installed PV capacity. This is 
due to the small size of many rooftop installations and the difficulties 
in participating in trading schemes for residential end users. Similar 
conclusions were reached by (Dijkgraaf et al. 2018) assessing 30 OECD 
countries and concluding that there is a ‘positive effect of the presence 
of a FiT on the development of a country’s added yearly capacity of 
PV’. Other scholars (Lewis and Wiser 2007; Lipp 2007; Cory et al. 2009; 
Couture and Gagnon 2010) concluded that FiT can create a  stable 
investment framework and long-term policy certainty and it is better 
than RPS for industrial development and job creation. Ouyang and Lin 
(2014) highlighted that RPS has a better implementation effect than 
FiT in China, where FiT required very large subsidy. Ford et al. (2007) 
showed that TGC is a market-based mechanism without the need for 
government subsidies. Marchenko (2008) and W¸ edzik et  al. (2017) 
indicate that the TGCs provide a source of income for investors. Choi 
et al. (2018a) analysed the economic efficiency of FiT and RPS in the 
South Korean, where FiT was implemented from 2002 to 2011 followed 
by an RPS since 2012 (Park and Kim 2018; Choi et al. 2018b). Choi 
concluded that RPS was more efficient for PV from the government’s 
perspective while from an energy producers’ perspective the FiT was 
more efficient. Some scholars proposed a policy combining FiT and RPS 
(Cory et al. 2009). Kwon (2015) and del Río et al. (2017) concluded that 
both FiT and RPS are effective, but policy costs are higher in RPSs than 
FiTs. RPS, REC trading and FiT subsidy could also be implemented as 
complementary policies (Zhang et al. 2018). 
Tenders are a fast spreading and effective instrument to attract and 
procure new generation capacity from renewable energy sources 
(Bayer et  al. 2018; Batz and Musgens 2019; Bento et  al.  2020; 
Chapter 9 Buildings9Ghazali et  al. 2020; Haelg 2020). A support scheme based on 
tenders allows a  more precise steering of expansion and lower 
risk of excessive support (Gephart et al. 2017). Bento et al. (2020) 
indicated that tendering is more effective in promoting additional 
renewable capacity comparing to other mechanisms such as FiTs. It 
is also important to take into account the rebound effect in energy 
consumption by on-site PV users, which might reduce up to one fifth 
of the carbon benefit of renewable energy (Deng and Newton 2017).
Financing mechanisms for RES are particularly needed in developing 
countries. Most of the common supporting mechanisms (FiT, RPSs, 
PPA, auctions, net metering, etc.) have been implemented in some 
developing countries (Donastorg et  al. 2017). Stable policies and an 
investment-friendly environment are essential to overcome financing 
barriers and attract investors (Donastorg et  al. 2017). Kimura et  al. 
(2016) identified the following elements as essential for fostering 
RES in developing countries: innovative business models and financial 
mechanisms/structures; market creation through the implementation of 
market-based mechanisms; stability of policies and renewable energy 
legislation; technical assistance to reduce the uncertainty of renewable 
energy production; electricity market design, which reflects the impact 
on the grid capacity and grid balancing; improved availability of financial 
resources, in particular public, and innovative financial instruments, 
such as carbon financing (Lim et al. 2013; Park et al. 2018; Kim and 
Park 2018); green bonds; public foreign exchange hedging facility for 
renewable energy financing, credit lines; grants and guarantees.
The end-user will be at the centre as a  key participant in the future 
electricity system (Zepter et al. 2019; Lavrijssen and Carrillo Parra, 2017) 
providing flexibility, storage, energy productions, peer-to-peer trading, 
electric vehicle charging. Zepter indicates that ‘the current market 
designs and business models lack incentives and  opportunities for electricity consumers to become prosumers and actively participate in 
the market’. Klein et al. (2019) explore the policy options for aligning 
prosumers with the electricity wholesale market, through price and 
scarcity signals. Policies should allow for active markets participation 
of small prosumers (Brown et al. 2019; Zepter et al. 2019), local energy 
communities and new energy market actors such as aggregators (Iria 
and Soares 2019; Brown et  al. 2019). Energy Communities are new 
important players in the energy transition (Sokołowski 2020; Gjorgievski 
et al. 2021). Citizens and local communities can establish local energy 
communities, providing local RES production to serve the community, 
alleviate energy poverty and export energy into the grid (DellaValle and 
Sareen, 2020; Hahnel et al. 2020). Energy Communities have as primary 
purpose to provide environmental, economic, or social community 
benefits by engaging in generation, aggregation, energy storage, 
energy efficiency services and charging services for electric vehicles. 
Energy communities help in increasing public acceptance and mobilise 
private funding. Demand response aggregators (Mahmoudi et al. 2017; 
Henriquez et  al. 2018) can aggregate load reductions by a  group of 
consumers, and sell the resulting flexibility to the electricity  market 
(Zancanella et al. 2017). Regulatory frameworks for electricity markets 
should allow demand response to compete on equal footing in energy 
markets and encourage new business models for the provision of 
flexibility to the electricity grid (Shen et al. 2014). Renewable energy and 
sufficiency requirements could be included in building energy codes 
and  implemented in coordination with each other and with climate 
policies, for example, carbon pricing (Oikonomou et al. 2014).

As Section  9.6.3 points out, the incremental investment cost to 
decarbonise buildings at national level is up to 3.5% GDP per annum

Buildings  Chapter 99during the next thirty years (the global GDP in 2019 was USD88 trillion). 
As the following figures illustrate, only a very small share of it is currently 
being invested, leaving a  very large investment gap still to address. 
The incremental capital expenditure on energy efficiency in buildings 
has grown since AR5 to reach the estimated USD193 billion in 2021; 
Europe was the largest investing region, followed by the USA and 
China (Figure 9.21). The incremental capital expenditure on renewable 
energy heat vice versa declined to reach USD24 billion in this year; the 
leading investor was China, followed by Europe (ibid). The total capital 
expenditure on distributed small-scale (less than 1MW) solar systems 
in 2019 was USD52.1 billion, down from the peak of USD71 billion in 
2011; most of this capacity is installed in buildings (Frankfurt School-
UNEP Centre/BNEF 2020). The US was the largest country market 
with USD9.6 billion investment; notably USD5 billion was deployed in 
the Middle East and Africa (ibid). IEA (2021b) provided an estimate 
of annual average incremental investment needs in building sector 
decarbonation between 2026 and 2030 of USD711 billion, including 
USD509 billion in building energy efficiency and USD202 billion in 
renewable heat for end-use and electrification in buildings. Such 
investment would allow being on track towards meeting the goals 
of the WEO Net Zero Emissions Scenario, as presented in Box  9.2. 
To  reach these levels, the respective investment must grow from 
their average volumes in 2016–2020 factor 3.6 and 4.5 respectively. 
As the investment  needs estimated by (IEA 2021b) are significantly 
lower the  investment intervals reported by bottom-up literature 
(Section 9.6.3), the actual investment gap is likely to be higher. 
9.9.7 Governance and Institutional Capacity
9.9.7.1 Governance
Multi-level and polycentric governance is essential for implementing 
sufficiency, energy efficiency and renewable energies policies (IPCC 
2018). Policies can be implemented at different levels of government 
and decision making, international, national, regional, and local. 
Policies for building have be adopted at national level (Enker and 
Morrison 2017), at state or regional level (Fournier et al. 2019), or 
at city level (Trencher and van der Heijden 2019). Zhao et al. (2019) 
find that national policies are instrumental in driving low carbon 
developments in buildings.
International agreements (Kyoto, Montreal/Kigali, Paris, etc.) play an 
important role in establishing national energy-efficiency and renewable 
energy policies in several countries (Dhar et al. 2018; Bertoldi 2018). 
Under the Paris Agreement, some NDCs contain emission reduction 
targets for subsectors, for example, buildings, policies for subsectors 
and energy efficiency and/or renewable targets (see also Cross-
Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 4). In the EU since 2007 climate and energy 
policies are part of a co-ordinated policy package. EU Member States 
have prepared energy efficiency plans every three years and long-term 
renovation strategies for buildings (Economidou et al. 2020). Under 
the new Energy and Climate Governance Regulation EU Member 
States have submitted at the end of 2020 integrated National Energy 
and Climate Plans, including energy efficiency and renewable plans. 
(Oberthur 2019; Schlacke and Knodt 2019). The integration of energy 
and climate change policies and their governance has been analysed (von Lüpke and Well 2020), highlighting the need of reinforcing the 
institutions, anticipatory governance, the inconsistency of energy 
policies and the emerging multi-level governance.
Some policies are best implemented at international level. Efficiency 
requirements for traded goods and the associated test methods could 
be set at global level in order to enlarge the market, avoid technical 
barriers to trade; reduce the manufacturers design and compliance 
costs. International standards could be applied to developing countries 
when specific enabling conditions exist, particularly in regard to 
technology transfer, assistance for capacity buildings and financial 
support. This would also reduce the dumping of inefficient equipment 
in countries with no or lower efficiency requirements. An example is the 
dumping of new or used inefficient cooling equipment in developing 
countries, undermining national and local efforts to manage energy, 
environment, health, and climate goals. Specific regulations can be 
put in place to avoid such environmental dumping, beginning with the 
‘prior informed consent’ as in the Rotterdam Convention and a later 
stage with the adoption of minimum efficiency requirements for 
appliances (Andersen et al. 2018; UNEP 2017). Dreyfus et al. (2020a) 
indicates that global policies to promote best technologies currently 
available have the potential to reduce climate emissions from air 
conditionings and refrigeration equipment by 210–460 GtCO 2-eq by 
2060, resulting from the phasing down of HFC and from improved 
energy efficiency. Another example is the commitment by governments 
in promoting improvements in energy efficiency of cooling equipment 
in parallel with the phasedown of HFC refrigerants enshrined in the 
Biarritz Pledge for Fast Action on Efficient Cooling signed in 2019. 
The policy development and implementation costs will be reduced as 
the technical analysis leading to the standard could be shared among 
governments. However, it is important that local small manufacturing 
companies in developing countries have the capacity to invest in 
updating production lines for meeting new stringent international 
efficiency requirements. 
Building energy consumption is dependent on local climate and 
building construction traditions, regional and local government 
share an important role in promoting energy efficiency in buildings 
and on-site RES, through local building energy codes, constructions 
permits and urban planning. In South Korea, there is a green building 
certification system operated by the government, based on this, 
Seoul has enacted Seoul’s building standard, which includes more 
stringent requirements. Where it is difficult to retrofit existing 
buildings, for example, historical buildings, cities may impose target 
at district level, where RES could be shared among buildings with 
energy positive buildings compensating for energy consuming 
buildings. Local climate and urban plans could also contribute to 
the integration of the building sector with the local transport, water, 
and energy sectors, requiring, for example, new constructions in 
areas served by public transport, close to offices or buildings to be 
ready for e-mobility. Buildings GHG emission reduction shall also 
be considered in greenfield and brownfield developments and urban 
expansion (Loo et al. 2017; Salviati and Ricciardo Lamonica 2020), 
including co-benefits (Zapata-Diomedi et al. 2019).
Energy efficiency, sufficiency, and renewable policies and measures 
will have a  large impact on different stakeholders (citizens, 
Chapter 9 Buildings9construction companies; equipment manufacturers; utilities, 
etc.), several studies highlighted the importance of stakeholder 
consultation and active participation in policy making and policy 
implementation (Vasileiadou and Tuinstra 2013; Ingold et  al. 
2020), including voluntary commitments and citizen assemblies. 
In particular, energy user’s role will be transformed from passive role 
to an active role, as outlined in the concept of energy citizenship 
(Campos and Marín-González 2020). The energy citizens need 
and voice should therefore be included in policy processes among 
traditional business players, such as incumbent centralised power 
generation companies and utilities (Van Veelen 2018). Architects and 
engineers play an important role in the decarbonisation of buildings. 
The professional bodies can mandate their members support energy 
efficiency and sufficiency. For example, the US AIA states in their 
code of ethics that architects must inform clients of climate risks and 
opportunities for sustainability. The capacity and quality of workforce 
and building construction, retrofit, and service firms are essential to 
execute the fast transition in building systems (Cross-Chapter Box 12 
in Chapter 16).
9.9.7.2 Institutional Capacity 
The concept of institutional capacity is increasingly connected with 
the issue of public governance, emphasising the broad institutional 
context within which individual policies are adopted. Institutions 
are durable and are sources of authority (formal or informal) 
structuring repeated interactions of individuals, companies, civil 
society groups, governments, and other entities. Thus, institutional 
capacity also represents a  broader ‘enabling environment’ which 
forms the basis upon which individuals and organisations interact. 
In general terms, capacity is ‘the ability to perform functions, solve 
problems and set and achieve objectives’ (Fukuda-Parr et al. 2002). 
Institutional capacity is an important element for regional sustainable 
development (Farajirad et  al. 2015). The role and importance of 
institutional capacity is fundamental in implementing the building 
decarbonisation. Central and local governments, regulatory 
organisations, financial institutions, standardisation bodies, test 
laboratories, building construction and design companies, qualified 
workforce and stakeholders are key players in supporting the 
implementation of building decarbonisation. 
Governments (from national to local) planning to introduce 
efficiency, RES, and sufficiency policies needs technical capacity 
to set sectoral targets and design policies and introduce effective 
and enforcement with adequate structure and resources for their 
implementation. Policies discussed and agreed with stakeholders 
and based on impartial data and impact assessments, have a higher 
possibility of success. Public authorities need technical and economics 
competences to understand complex technical issues and eliminate 
the knowledge gap in comparison to private sector experts, human 
and financial resources to design, implement, revise, and evaluate 
policies. The role of energy efficiency policy evaluation needs to be 
expanded, including the assessment of the rebound effect (Vine 
et  al. 2013). For developing countries international support for 
institutional capacity for policy development, implementation and 
evaluation is of key importance for testing laboratory, standards 
institute, enforcement and compliances technicians and evaluation experts. Thus, in development support, addition to technology 
transfer, also capacity buildings for national and local authorities 
should be provides. The Paris Agreement Article 11 aims at enhancing 
the capacity of decision-making institutions in developing countries 
to support effective implementation. 
Enforcement of policies is of key importance. Policies on appliance 
energy standards need to establish criteria for random checks and 
tests of compliance, establish penalties and sanctions for non-
compliance. For building code compliance there is the need to verify 
compliance after construction to verify the consistence with building 
design (Vine et al. 2017). Often local authorities lack resources and 
technical capacity to carry out inspections to check code compliance. 
This issue is even more pressing in countries and cities with large 
informal settlements, where buildings may not be respecting building 
energy codes for safety and health.
9.10 Knowledge Gaps
Insights from regions, sectors, and communities:
• Due to the dominating amount of literature from Developed 
Countries and rapidly developing Asia (China), the evidence 
and therefore conclusions are limited for the developing world. 
In particular, there is limited evidence on the potential and costs 
the countries of South-East Asia and Pacific, Africa, and Latin 
America and Caribbean.
• The contribution of indigenous knowledge in the evolvement of 
buildings is not well appreciated. There is a need to understand 
this contribution and provide methodological approaches for 
incorporation of indigenous knowledge. 
• Analysis of emissions and energy demand trends in non-
residential buildings is limited due to the number of building 
types included in this category and the scarcity of data for each 
building type. The use of new data gathering techniques such as 
machine learning, GIS combined with digital technologies to fill in 
this data gap was not identified in the literature. Consideration of 
embodied emissions from building stock growth has only recently 
entered the global scenario literature, and more development is 
expected in this area.
Measures, potentials, and costs:
• There is a lack of scientific reporting of case studies of exemplary 
buildings, specially from developing countries. Also, there is 
a lack of identification of researchers on technologies with the 
mitigation potential of such technologies, bringing a  lack in 
quantification of that potential.
• There is limited evidence on sufficiency measures including 
those from behavioural energy saving practices: updated 
categorisations, current adoption rates and willingness to adopt.
• There is limited evidence on circular and shared economy in 
buildings, including taxonomies, potentials, current adoption 
rates and willingness to adopt.
Buildings  Chapter 99• Most of the literature on climate change impacts on buildings is 
focused on thermal comfort. There is need for further research 
on climate change impacts on buildings structure, materials and 
construction and the energy and emissions associated with those 
impacts. Also, more studies that assess the role of passive energy 
efficiency measures as adaptation options are needed. Finally, 
regional studies leave out in depth analyses of specific regions.
Feasibility and policies:
• Applications of human centred profiles for targeted policy 
making and considering stages of diffusion of innovation, that 
is: what works (motivation) for whom (different stakeholders, not 
only households) and when (stages of market maturity).
• The multiple co-benefits of mitigation actions are rarely 
integrated into decision-making processes. So, there is a need to 
further develop methodologies to quantify and monetise these 
externalities as well as indicators to facilitate their incorporation 
in energy planning. 
• Policies for sufficiency have to be further analysed and tested 
in real situation, including ex ante simulation and ex post 
evaluation. The same is also valid for Personable (tradable) 
Carbon Allowances.
Methods and models:
• There is limited literature on the integration of behavioural 
measures and lifestyle changes in modelling exercises.
• Mitigation potential resulting from the implementation of 
sufficiency measures is not identified in global energy/climate and 
building scenarios despite the growing literature on sufficiency. 
At the best, mitigation potential from behaviour change is 
quantified in energy scenarios; savings from structural changes 
and resource efficiency are not identified in the literature on 
global and building energy models. 
• The actual costs of the potential could be higher to rather 
optimistic assumptions of the modelling literature, for example, 
assuming a  2–3% retrofit rate, and even higher, versus the 
current 1%. The uncertainty ranges of potential costs are not 
well understood.
• Despite a  large number of exemplary buildings achieving very 
high performance in all parts of the world and a growing amount 
of modelling literature on the potential, if these will penetrate at 
scale, there is a lack of modelling literature assessing the costs of 
respective actions at national, regional, and global level based on 
comprehensive cost assessments. 
• There is a lack of peer-reviewed literature on investment gaps, 
which compares the investment need in the building sector 
decarbonisation and recent investment flows into it estimated 
with the same costing methodologies.
Chapter 9 Buildings9Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
FAQ 9.1 | To which GHG emissions do buildings contribute?
There are three categories of GHG emissions from buildings: 
i. direct emissions which are defined as all on-site fossil fuel or biomass-based combustion activities (i.e.,  use of biomass 
for cooking, or gas for heating and hot water) and F-gas emissions (i.e., use of heating and cooling systems, aerosols, fire 
extinguishers, soundproof);
ii. indirect emissions which occur off-site and are related to heat and electricity production; and 
iii. embodied emissions which are related to extracting, producing, transforming, transporting, and installing the construction 
material and goods used in buildings. 
In 2019, global GHG emissions from buildings were at 12 GtCO 2-eq out of which 24% were direct emissions, 57% were indirect 
emissions, and 18% were embodied emissions. More than 95% of emissions from buildings were CO 2 emissions, CH 4 and N 2O 
represented 0.08% each and emissions from halocarbon contributed by 3% to global GHG emissions from buildings.
FAQ 9.2 | What are the co-benefits and trade-offs of mitigation actions in buildings?
Mitigation actions in buildings generate multiple co-benefits (e.g.,  health benefits due to the improved indoor and outdoor 
conditions, productivity gains in non-residential buildings, creation of new jobs particularly at local level, improvements in social 
well-being etc.) beyond their direct impact on reducing energy consumption and GHG emissions. Most studies agree that the value 
of these multiple benefits is greater than the value of energy savings and their inclusion in economic evaluation of mitigation 
actions may improve substantially their cost-effectiveness. It is also worth mentioning that in several cases the buildings sector 
is characterised by strong rebound effects, which could be considered as a co-benefit in cases where the mechanisms involved 
provide faster access to affordable energy but also a trade-off in cases where the external costs of increased energy consumption 
exceed the welfare benefits of the increased energy service consumption, thus lowering the economic performance of mitigation 
actions. The magnitude of these co-benefits and trade-offs are characterised by several uncertainties, which may be even higher in 
the future as mitigation actions will be implemented in a changing climate, with changing building operation style and occupant 
behaviour. Mitigation measures influence the degree of vulnerability of buildings to future climate change. For instance, temperature 
rise can increase energy consumption, which may lead to higher GHG emissions. Also, sea level rise, increased storms and rainfall 
under future climate may impact building structure, materials and components, resulting in increased energy consumption and 
household expenditure from producing and installing new components and making renovations. Well-planned energy efficiency, 
sufficiency and on-site renewable energy production can help to increase building resilience to climate change impacts and reduce 
adaptation needs.
FAQ 9.3 | Which are the most effective policies and measures to decarbonise the building sector?
Several barriers (information, financing, markets, behavioural, etc.) still prevents the decarbonisation of buildings stock, despite 
the several co-benefits, including large energy savings. Solutions include investments in technological solutions (e.g., insulation, 
efficient equipment, and low-carbon energies and renewable energies) and lifestyle changes. In addition, the concept of sufficiency 
is suggested to be promoted and implemented through policies and information, as technological solutions will be not enough to 
decarbonise the building sector. Due to the different types of buildings, occupants, and development stage there is not a single policy, 
which alone will reach the building decarbonisation target. A range of policy instruments ranging from regulatory measures such 
as building energy code for NZEBs and appliance standards, to market-based instruments (carbon tax, personal carbon allowance, 
renewable portfolio standards, etc.) and information. Financing (grants, loans, performance base incentives, pays as you save, etc.) is 
another key enabler for energy efficiency technologies and on-site renewables. Finally, effective governance and strong institutional 
capacity are key to have an effective and successful implementation of policies and financing.
