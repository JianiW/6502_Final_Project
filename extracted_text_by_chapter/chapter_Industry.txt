Industry  Chapter 1111
Executive Summary
The Paris Agreement, the Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs) and the COVID-19 pandemic provide a  new context 
for the evolution of industry and the mitigation of industry 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (high confidence). This chapter 
is focused on what is new since AR5. It emphasises the energy and 
emissions intensive basic materials industries and key strategies for 
reaching net zero emissions. {11.1.1}
Net zero CO 2 emissions from the industrial sector are possible 
but challenging (high confidence). Energy efficiency will continue 
to be important. Reduced materials demand, material efficiency, 
and circular economy solutions can reduce the need for primary 
production. Primary production options include switching to new 
processes that use low to zero GHG energy carriers and feedstocks 
(e.g., electricity, hydrogen, biofuels, and carbon capture and utilisation 
(CCU) for carbon feedstock), and carbon capture and storage (CCS) 
for remaining CO 2. These options require substantial scaling up of 
electricity, hydrogen, recycling, CO 2, and other infrastructure, as 
well as phase-out or conversion of existing industrial plants. While 
improvements in the GHG intensities of major basic materials 
have nearly stagnated over the last 30 years, analysis of historical 
technology shifts and newly available technologies indicate these 
intensities can be reduced to net zero emissions by mid-century. 
{11.2, 11.3, 11.4}
Whatever metric is used, industrial emissions have been 
growing faster since 2000 than emissions in any other sector, 
driven by increased basic materials extraction and production 
(high confidence). GHG emissions attributed to the industrial 
sector originate from fuel combustion, process emissions, product 
use and waste, which jointly accounted for 14.1 GtCO 2-eq or 24% of 
all direct anthropogenic emissions in 2019, second behind the 
energy transformation sector. Industry is a  leading GHG emitter  – 

emissions from power and heat generation are included. The share of 
emissions originating from direct fuel combustion is decreasing and 
was 7 GtCO 2-eq, 50% of direct industrial emissions in 2019. {11.2.2}
Global material intensity (in-use stock of manufactured capital, 
in tonnes per unit of GDP is increasing (high confidence). In-
use stock of manufactured capital per capita has been growing 
faster than GDP per capita since 2000. Total global in-use stock 
of manufactured capital grew by 3.4% yr–1 in 2000–2019. At the 
same time, per capita material stocks in several developed countries 
have stopped growing, showing a decoupling from GDP per capita. 
{11.2.1, 11.3.1}
Plastic is the material for which demand has been growing 
the strongest since 1970 (high confidence). The current 
>99%  reliance on fossil feedstock, very low recycling, and high 
emissions from petrochemical processes is a challenge for reaching 
net zero emissions. At the same time, plastics are important for 
reducing emissions elsewhere, for example, light-weighting vehicles. 
There are as yet no shared visions for fossil-free plastics, but several 
possibilities. {11.4.1.3}Scenario analyses show that significant cuts in global GHG  
emissions and even close to net zero emissions from 
GHG  intensive industry (e.g.,  steel, plastics, ammonia, and 
cement) can be achieved by 2050 by deploying multiple 
available and emerging options (medium confidence). Cutting 
industry emissions significantly requires a  reorientation from 
the historic focus on important but incremental improvements 
(e.g., energy efficiency) to transformational changes in energy and 
feedstock sourcing, materials efficiency, and more circular material 
flows. {11.3, 11.4}
Key climate mitigation options such as materials efficiency, 
circular material flows and emerging primary processes, are 
not well represented in climate change scenario modelling and 
integrated assessment models, albeit with some progress in 
recent years (high confidence). The character of these interventions 
(e.g., appearing in many forms across complex value chains, making 
cost estimates difficult) combined with the limited data on new fossil-
free primary processes help explain why they are less represented in 
models than, for example, CCS. As a result, overall mitigation costs 
and the need for CCS may be overestimated. {11.4.2.1}
Electrification is emerging as a  key mitigation option for 
industry (high confidence). Electricity is a versatile energy carrier, 
potentially produced from abundant renewable energy sources or 
other low carbon options; regional resources and preferences will vary. 
Using electricity directly, or indirectly via hydrogen from electrolysis 
for high temperature and chemical feedstock requirements, offers 
many options to reduce emissions. It also can provide substantial 
grid balancing services, for example through electrolysis and storage 
of hydrogen for chemical process use or demand response. {11.3.5}
Carbon is a key building block in organic chemicals, fuels and 
materials, and will remain important (high confidence). In order 
to reach net zero CO 2 emissions for the carbon needed in society 
(e.g.,  plastics, wood, aviation fuels, solvents, etc.), it is important 
to close the use loops for carbon and carbon dioxide through 
increased circularity with mechanical and chemical recycling, more 
efficient use of biomass feedstock with the addition of low GHG 
hydrogen to increase product yields (e.g.,  for biomethane and 
methanol), and potentially direct air capture of CO 2 as a new carbon 
source. {11.3, 11.4.1}
Production costs for very low to zero emissions basic materials 
may be high but the cost for final consumers and the general 
economy will be low (medium confidence). Costs and emissions 
reductions potential in industry, and especially heavy industry, are 
highly contingent on innovation, commercialisation, and market 
uptake policy. Technologies exist to take all industry sectors to very 
low or zero emissions but require 5 to 15 years of intensive innovation, 
commercialisation, and policy to ensure uptake. Mitigation costs are 
in the rough range of USD50–150 tCO 2-eq–1, with wide variation 
within and outside this band. This affects competitiveness and 
requires supporting policy. Although production cost increases can 
be significant, they translate to very small increases in the costs 
for final products, typically less than a  few percent depending on 
product, assumptions, and system boundaries. {11.4.1.5}
Chapter 11 Industry11There are several technological options for very low to zero 
emissions steel, but their uptake will require integrated 
material efficiency, recycling, and production decarbonisation 
policies (high confidence). Material efficiency can potentially 
reduce steel demand by up to 40% based on design for less steel use, 
long life, reuse, constructability, and low contamination recycling. 
Secondary production through high quality recycling must be 
maximised. Production decarbonisation will also be required, starting 
with the retrofitting of existing facilities for partial fuel switching 
(e.g., to biomass or hydrogen), CCU and CCS, followed by very low 
and zero emissions production based on high-capture CCS or direct 
hydrogen, or electrolytic iron ore reduction followed by an electric arc 
furnace. {11.3.2, 11.4.1.1}
There are several current and near-horizon options to 
greatly reduce cement and concrete emissions. Producer, 
user, and regulator education, as well as innovation and 
commercialisation policy are needed (medium confidence). 
Cement and concrete are currently overused because they are 
inexpensive, durable, and ubiquitous, and consumption decisions 
typically do not give weight to their production emissions. Basic 
material efficiency efforts to use only well-made concrete thoughtfully 
and only where needed (e.g.,  using right-sized, prefabricated 
components) could reduce emissions by 24–50% through lower 
demand for clinker. Cementitious material substitution with various 
materials (e.g.,  ground limestone and calcined clays) can reduce 
process calcination emissions by up to 50% and occasionally much 
more. Until a very low GHG emissions alternative binder to Portland 
cement is commercialised, which does not look promising in the near 
to medium term, CCS will be essential for eliminating the limestone 
calcination process emissions for making clinker, which currently 
represent 60% of GHG emissions in best available technology plants. 
{11.3.2, 11.3.6, 11.4.1.2}
While several technological options exist for decarbonising 
the  main industrial feedstock chemicals and their 
derivatives, the costs vary widely (high confidence). Fossil fuel-
based feedstocks are inexpensive and still without carbon pricing, 
and their biomass- and electricity-based replacements will likely 
be more expensive. The chemical industry consumes large amounts 
of hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, carbon monoxide, ethylene, 
propylene, benzene, toluene, and mixed xylenes and aromatics from 
fossil feedstock, and from these basic chemicals produces tens of 
thousands of derivative end-use chemicals. Hydrogen, biogenic or air-
capture carbon, and collected plastic waste for the primary feedstocks 
can greatly reduce total emissions. Biogenic carbon feedstock is likely 
to be limited due to competing land uses. {11.4.1.3}
Light industry and manufacturing can be largely decarbonised 
through switching to low GHG fuels (e.g.,  biofuels and 
hydrogen) and electricity (e.g.,  for electrothermal heating 
and heat pumps) (high confidence). Most of these technologies are 
already mature, for example, for low temperature heat, but a major 
challenge is the current low cost of fossil methane and coal relative 
to low and zero GHG electricity, hydrogen, and biofuels. {11.4.1.4}The pulp and paper industry has significant biogenic carbon 
emissions but relatively small fossil carbon emissions. Pulp 
mills have access to biomass residues and by-products and 
in paper mills the use of process heat at low to medium 
temperatures allows for electrification (high confidence). 
Competition for feedstock will increase if wood substitutes for 
building materials and petrochemicals feedstock. The pulp and paper 
industry can also be a source of biogenic carbon dioxide and carbon 
for organic chemicals feedstock and carbon dioxide removal (CDR) 
using CCS. {11.4.1.4}
The geographical distribution of renewable resources has 
implications for industry (medium confidence). The potential 
for zero emission electricity and low-cost hydrogen from electrolysis 
powered by solar and wind, or hydrogen from other very low emission 
sources, may reshape where currently energy and emissions intensive 
basic materials production is located, how value chains are organised, 
trade patterns, and what gets transported in international shipping. 
Regions with bountiful solar and wind resources, or low fugitive 
methane co-located with CCS geology, may become exporters of 
hydrogen or hydrogen carriers such as methanol and ammonia, or 
home to the production of iron and steel, organic platform chemicals, 
and other energy-intensive basic materials. {11.2, 11.4 and Box 11.1}
The level of policy maturity and experience varies widely across 
the mitigation options (high confidence). Energy efficiency 
is a  well-established policy field with decades of experience from 
voluntary and negotiated agreements, regulations, energy auditing 
and demand side-management (DSM) programmes (see AR5). In 
contrast, materials demand management and efficiency are not well 
understood and addressed from a  policy perspective. Barriers to 
recycling that policy could address are often specific to the different 
material loops (e.g.,  copper contamination for steel and lack of 
technologies or poor economics for plastics) or waste management 
systems. For electrification and fuel switching the focus has so far 
been mainly on innovation and developing technical supply-side 
solutions rather than creating market demand. {11.5.2, 11.6}
Industry has so far largely been sheltered from the impacts 
of climate policy and carbon pricing due to concerns for 
competitiveness and carbon leakage (high confidence). New 
industrial development policy approaches needed for realising 
a transition to net zero GHG emissions are emerging. The transition 
requires a clear direction towards net zero, technology development, 
market demand for low-carbon materials and products, governance 
capacity and learning, socially inclusive phase-out plans, as well as 
international coordination of climate and trade policies. It requires 
comprehensive and sequential industrial policy strategies leading to 
immediate action as well as preparedness for future decarbonisation, 
governance at different levels (from international to local), and 
integration with other policy domains. {11.6}
Industry  Chapter 111111.1 Introduction and New Developments
11.1.1 About This Chapter
The AR5 was published in 2014. The Paris Agreement and the 

An increasing number of countries have since announced ambitions 
to be carbon neutral by 2045–2060. The COVID-19 pandemic shocked 
the global economy in 2020 and motivated economic stimulus with 
demands for green recovery and concerns for economic security. 
All this has created a new context and a growing recognition that all 
industry, including the energy and emissions intensive industries, 
need to reach net zero GHG emissions. There is an ongoing mind 
shift around the opportunities to do so, with electrification and 
hydrogen emerging among key mitigation options as a  result of 
renewable electricity costs falling rapidly. On the demand side there 
has been renewed attention to end-use demand, material efficiency, 
and more and better-quality recycling measures. This chapter takes 
its starting point in this new context and emphasises the need for 
deploying innovative processes and practices in order to limit the 
global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C (IPCC 2018a).
The industrial sector includes ores and minerals mining, manufacturing, 
construction and waste management. It is the largest source of global 
GHG and CO 2 emissions, which include direct and indirect fuel-
combustion-related emissions, emissions from industrial processes 
and products use, as well as from waste. This chapter is focused on 
heavy industry – the high temperature heat and process emissions 
intensive basic materials industries that account for 65% of industrial 
GHG and over 70% of industrial CO 2 emissions (waste excluded), 
where deployment of near -zero emissions technologies can be 
more challenging due to capital intensity and equipment lifetimes 
compared with other manufacturing industries. The transition of 
heavy industries to zero emissions requires supplementing the 
traditional toolkit of energy and process efficiency, fuel switching, 
electrification, and decarbonisation of power with material end-use 
demand management and efficiency, circular economy, fossil-free 
feedstocks, carbon capture and utilisation (CCU), and carbon capture 
and storage (CCS). Energy efficiency was extensively treated in AR5 and  
remains a key mitigation option. This chapter is focused mainly on 
new options and developments since AR5, highlighting measures 
along the whole value chains that are required to approach zero 
emissions in primary materials production.

in different forms in the long-term projections for the whole economy (Krausmann et al. 2020) and for some sectors (buildings and cars in Hertwich et al. (2020)) with 
a steadily improving regional resolution (Krausmann et al. 2020).11.1.2 Approach to Understanding Industrial Emissions
The Kaya identity offers a useful tool of decomposing emission sources 
and their drivers, as well as of weighing the mitigation options. 
The one presented below (Equation 11.1) builds on the previous 
assessments (IPCC 2014, 2018b; Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018), and 
reflect a  material stock-driven services-oriented vision to better 
highlight the growing importance of industrial processes (dominated 
in emissions  increments in 2010–2019), product use and waste in 
driving emissions. Services delivery (nutrition, shelter, mobility, 
education, etc.; see Chapter 5 for more detail) not only requires energy 
and material flows (fuels, food, feed, fertilisers, packaging, etc.), but 
also material stocks (buildings, roads, vehicles, machinery, etc.), the 
mass of which has already exceeded 1000 Gt (Krausmann et al. 2018). 
As material efficiency appears to be an important mitigation option, 
material intensity or productivity (material extraction or consumption 
versus GDP (Oberle et al. 2019; Hertwich et al. 2020)) is reflected in 
the identity with two dimensions: as material stock intensity of GDP 
(tonnes per dollar) and material intensity of building and operating 
accumulated in-use stock.1 For sub-global analysis the ratio of 
domestically used materials to total material production becomes 
important to reflect outsourced materials production and distinguish 
between territorial and consumption-based emissions. The identity 
for industry differs significantly from that for sectors with where 
combustion emissions dominate (Lamb et al. 2021).
Chapter 11 Industry11Recent progress in data availability that allows the integration of 
major emission sources along with socio-economic metabolism, 
material flows and stock analysis enriches the identity for industry 
from a perspective of possible policy interventions (Bashmakov 2021):

negative feedbacks: scrap-based production or light-weighing 
improves operational energy efficiency, while growing application of 
carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) brings it down and increases 
material demands (Hertwich et al. 2019; IEA 2020a, 2021a). There are 
different ways to disaggregate Equation 11.1: by industrial subsectors 
(Bashmakov 2021); by reservoirs of material stock (buildings, 
infrastructure, vehicles, machinery and appliances, packaging, etc.); 
by regions and countries (where carbon leakage becomes relevant); 
by products and production chains (material extraction, production 
of basic materials, basic materials processing, production of final 
industrial products); by traditional and low carbon technologies used; 
and by stages of products’ lives including recycling.
An industrial transition to net zero emissions is possible when the 
three last multipliers in Equation 11.1 (in square parentheses) are 
approaching zero. Contributions from different drivers (energy 
efficiency, low carbon electricity and heat, material efficiency, 
switching to low carbon feedstock and CCUS) to this evolution vary 
with time. Energy efficiency dominates in the short- and medium 
term and potentially long term (in the range of 10–40% by 2050) 
(IPCC 2018a; Crijns-Graus et al. 2020; IEA 2020a), but for deep 
decarbonisation trajectories, contributions from the other drivers 
steadily grow, as the share of non-energy sources in industrial 
emissions rises and new technologies to address mitigation from 
these sources mature (Material Economics 2019; CEMBUREAU 2020; 
BP 2020; Hertwich et al. 2020, 2019; IEA 2021a, 2020a; Saygin and 
Gielen 2021) (Figure 11.1).

Chapter 11 Industry1111.2 New Trends in Emissions 
and Industrial Development
11.2.1 Major Drivers
The use of materials is deeply coupled with economic development 
and growth. For centuries, humanity has been producing and using 
hundreds of materials (Ashby 2012), the diversity of which skyrocketed 
in the recent half-century to achieve the desired performance and 
functionality of multiple products (density; hardness; compressive 
strength; melting point, resistance to mechanical and thermal shocks 
and to corrosion; transparency; heat- or electricity conductivity; 
chemical neutrality or activity, to name a  few). New functions 
drive the growth of material complexity of products; for example, 
a  modern computer chip embodies over 60 different elements 
(Graedel et al. 2015).

3–5 % (IEA 2020a).Key factors driving up industrial GHG emissions since 1900 include 
population and per capita GDP ,2 while energy efficiency and non-
combustion GHG emissions intensity (from industrial processes 
and waste) has been pushing it down. Material efficiency factors – 
material stock intensity of GDP and ratio of extraction, processing 
and recycling of materials per unit of built capital along with 
combustion-related emissions intensity factors and electrification – 
were cyclically switching their contributions with relatively limited 
overall impact. Growing recycling allowed for replacement of 
some energy-intensive virgin materials and thus contributed to 
mitigation. In 2014–2019, a combination of these drivers allowed 
for a  slowdown in the growth of industrial GHG emissions to 
below 1% (Figure 11.2 and Table 11.1), while to match a net zero 
emissions trajectory it should decline by 2% yr–1 in 2020–2030 and 
by 8.9% yr–1 in 2030–2050 (IEA 2021a).

(2020); industrial energy use for 1900–1970: IIASA (2018), for 1971–2019: IEA (2021b); data on industrial GHG emissions for 1900–1970: CDIAC (2017), for 1970–2019: 
data from Crippa et al. (2021) and Minx et al. (2021).
Industry  Chapter 1111There are two major concepts of material efficiency (ME). The 
broader one highlights demand reduction via policies promoting 
more intensive use, assuming sufficient (excluding luxury) living 
space or car ownership providing appropriate service levels  – 
housing days or miles driven and life-time extension (Hertwich et al. 
2019, 2020). This approach focuses on dematerialisation of society 
(Lechtenböhmer and Fischedick 2020), where a  ‘dematerialisation 
multiplier’ (Pauliuk et al. 2021) limits both material stock and GDP 
growth, as progressively fewer materials are required to build and 
operate the physical in-use stock to deliver sufficient services. 
According to the IRP (2020), reducing floor space demand by 20% 
via shared and smaller housing compared to the reference scenario 
would decrease Group of Seven (G7) countries’ GHG emissions from 
the material-cycle of residential construction up to 70% in 2050. 
The narrower concept ignores demand and sufficiency aspects and 
focuses on supply chains considering ME as less basic materials 
use to produce a certain final product, for example, a car or a metre 
squared of living space (OECD 2019a; IEA 2020a). No matter if the 
broader or the narrower concept of ME is applied, in 1970–2019 it 
did not contribute much to the decoupling of industrial emissions 
from GDP . This is expected to change in the future (Figure 11.2).
Material efficiency analysis mostly uses material intensity 
or  productivity indicators, which compare material extraction or 
consumption with GDP (Oberle et al. 2019; Hertwich et al. 2020). 
Those indicators are functions of material stock intensity of GDP 
(tonnes per dollar) and material intensity of building and operating 
accumulated in-use stock. Coupling services or GDP with the built 
stock allows for a  better evaluation of demand for primary basic 
materials (Müller et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2013; Liu and Müller 2013; 
Pauliuk et al. 2013a; Cao et al. 2017; Wiedenhofer et al. 2019; Hertwich 
et al. 2020; Krausmann et al. 2020). Since 1970 material stock growth 
driven by industrialisation and urbanisation slightly exceeded that of 
GDP and there was no decoupling,3 so in Kaya-like identities material 
stock may effectively replace GDP . There are different methods to 
estimate the former (see reviews in Pauliuk et al. (2015, 2019) and 
Wiedenhofer et al. (2019), the results of which are presented for major 
basic materials with some geographical resolution (Liu and Müller 
2013; Pauliuk et al. 2013a) or globally (Graedel et al. 2011; Geyer 
et al. 2017; Krausmann et al. 2018; Pauliuk et al. 2019; Wiedenhofer 
et al. 2019; International Aluminium Institute 2021a).
For a  subset of materials, such as solid wood, paper, plastics, 
iron/steel, aluminium, copper, other metals/minerals, concrete, 
asphalt, bricks, aggregate, and glass, total in-use stock escalated 
from 36 Gt back in 1900 to 186 Gt in 1970, 572 Gt in 2000, and 

per capita (Krausmann et al. 2018, 2020; Wiedenhofer et al. 2019). 
In 1900–2019, the stock grew 31-fold, which is strongly coupled 
with GDP growth (36-fold). As the UK experience shows, material 
stock intensity of GDP may ultimately decline after services 
fully dominate GDP , and this allows for material productivity 




as stock expansion slows down (Streeck et al. 2020). While the 
composition of basic materials within the stock of manufactured 
capital was evolving significantly, overall stock use associated 
with a unit of GDP has been evolving over the last half-century in 
a quite narrow range of 7.7–8.6 t per USD1000 (2017 purchasing 
power parity (PPP))  showing neither signs of decoupling from 
GDP , nor saturation as of yet. Mineral building materials (concrete, 
asphalt, bricks, aggregate, and glass) dominate the stock volume by 
mass (94.6% of the whole stock, with the share of concrete alone 
standing at 43.5%), followed by metals (3.5%) and solid wood 
(1.4%). The largest part of in-use stock of our ‘cementing societies’ 
(Cao et al. 2017) is constituted by concrete: about 417 Gt in 2015; 
Krausmann et al. (2018) extrapolated this to 478 Gt (65 tonnes 
per capita) in 2018, which contains about 88 Gt of cement.4 The 
iron and steel stock is assessed at 25–35 Gt (Wiedenhofer et al. 
2019; Gielen et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2021), while the plastics stock 
reached 2.5–3.2 Gt (Geyer et al. 2017; Wiedenhofer et al. 2019; 
Saygin and Gielen 2021) and the aluminium stock approached 
1.1 Gt (International Aluminium Institute 2021a), or just 0.1% of 
the total. In sharp contrast to global energy intensity, which has 
more than halved since 1900 (Bashmakov 2019), in 2019 material 
stock intensity (in-use stock of manufactured capital per GDP) was 
only 14% below the 1900 level, but 15% above the 1970 level. 
In-use stock per capita has been growing faster than GDP per 
capita since 2000 (Figure  11.3). The growth rate of total in-use 
stock of manufactured capital was 3.8% in 1971–2000 and 3.5% 
in 2000–2019, or 32–35 Gt yr–1, to which concrete and aggregates 
contributed 88%. Recent demand for stockbuilding materials was 
51–54 Gt yr–1, to which recycled materials recently contributed 
only about 10% of material input. About 46–49 Gt yr–1 was virgin 
inputs, which after accounting for processing waste and short-
lived products (over 8 Gt yr–1) scale up to 54–58 Gt yr–1 of primary 
extraction (Krausmann et al. 2017, 2018; UNEP and IRP 2020). The 
above indicates that we have only begun to exploit the potential 
for recycling and circularity more broadly.
Total extraction of all basic materials (including biomass and 
fuels) in 2017 reached 92 Gt yr–1, which is 13 times above the 

material inputs exceed 100 Gt (Circle Economy 2020). In Equation 
11.1 MPR represents only material inputs to the stock, excluding 
dissipative use – biomass (food and feed) and combusted fuels. Total 
extraction of stock building materials (metal ores and non-metallic 
minerals) in 2017 reached 55 Gt yr–1.6 In 1970–2018, it grew 4.3-fold 
and the ratio of MPR to accumulated in-use capital has nearly been 
constant since 1990 along with ratio to GDP (Figure 11.3).
End-of-life waste from accumulated stocks along with  
(re)-manufacturing and construction waste is assessed at 16 Gt yr–1 in 

2018; Wiedenhofer et al. 2019), or 1.8% from stock of manufactured 
Chapter 11 Industry11
capital. Less than 6 Gt yr–1 was recycled and used to build the stock 
(about 10% of inputs).7 While the circularity gap is still large, and 
limited circularity was engineered into accumulated stocks,8 material 
recycling mitigated some GHG emissions by replacing energy-
intensive virgin materials.9 When the stock saturates, in closed material 



but to enable and mobilise circularity benefits it requires social system and industrial designing transformation (Oberle et al. 2019).loops the end-of-life materials waste has to be equal to material input, 
and primary production therefore has to be equal to end-of-life waste 
multiplied by unity minus recycling rate. When the latter grows, as 
the linear metabolism is replaced with the circular one, the share of 
primary materials production in total material input declines.Non-metallic minerals –

Industry  Chapter 1111Recycling rates for metals are higher than for other materials: the 
end-of-life scrap input ratio for 13 metals is over 50%, and stays in 
the range of 25–50% for another ten, but even for metals recycling 
flows fail to match the required inputs (Graedel et al. 2011). Globally, 
despite overall recycling rates being at 85%, the all-scrap ratio for 
steel production in recent years stays close to 35–38% (Gielen et al. 
2020; IEA 2021b) ranging from 22% in China (only 10% in 2015) to 
69% in the US and to 83% in Turkey (BIR 2020). For end-of-life scrap 
this ratio declined from 30% in 1995–2010 to 21–25% after 2010 
(Gielen et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2021).
For aluminium, the share of scrap-based production grew from 17% 
in 1962 to 34% in 2010 and stabilised at this level until 2019, while 
the share of end-of-life scrap grew from 1.5% in 1962 to nearly 
20% in 2019 (International Aluminium Institute 2021a). The global 
recycling (mostly mechanical) rate for plastics is only 9–10%10 
(Geyer et al. 2017; Saygin and Gielen 2021), and that for paper 
progressed from 34% in 1990 to 44% in 2000 and to over 50% in 
2014–2018 (IEA 2020b).
The limited impacts of material efficiency factors on industrial 
GHG emissions trends reflect the lack of integration of material 
efficiency in energy and climate policies which partly results from the 
inadequacy of monitored indicators to inform policy debates and set 
targets;11 lack of high-level political focus and industrial lobbying; 
uncoordinated policy across institutions and sequential nature of 
decision-making along supply chains; carbon pricing policy lock-in 
with upstream sectors failing to pass carbon costs on to downstream 
sectors (due to compensation mechanisms to reduce carbon leakage) 
and so have no incentives to exploit such options as light-weighting, 
reusing, remanufacturing, recycling, diverting scrap, extending 
product lives, using products more intensely, improving process yields, 
and substituting materials (Skelton and Allwood 2017; Gonzalez 
Hernandez et al. 2018b; Hilton et al. 2018). Poor progress with 
material efficiency is part of the reason why industrial GHG emissions 
are perceived as ‘hard to abate’, and many industrial low-carbon 
trajectories to 2050 leave up to 40% of emissions in place (Material 
Economics 2019; IEA 2021a). The importance of this factor activation 
rises as in-use material stock is expected to scale up by a factor of 
2.2–2.7 to reach 2215–2720 Gt by 2050 (Krausmann et al. 2020). 
Material extraction in turn is expected to rise to 140–200 Gt yr–1 by 

pressure on climate and environment and calling for fundamental 
improvements in material productivity.
In 2014–2019, the average annual growth rate (AAGR) of global 
industrial energy use was 0.4% compared to 3.2% in 2000–2014, 
following new policies and trends, particularly demonstrated by 



reaching about a third in 2018 (IEA 2020d).

transformation, mining, quarrying, manufacturing and construction) 
driven mostly by material production, dominates global energy 
consumption. About two fifths of energy produced globally goes to 
industry, directly or indirectly. Direct energy use (including energy 
used in coal transformation) accounts for nearly 30% of total final 
energy consumption. When supplemented by non-energy use, the 
share for the post-AR5 period (2015–2019) stands on average close 
to 40% of final energy consumption, and at 28.5% of primary energy 
use.13 With an account of indirect energy use for the generation 
of power and centralised heat to be consumed in industry, the 
latter scales up to 37%. Industrial energy use may be split by: 
material production and extraction (including coal transformation): 
51% on average for 2015–2019; non-energy use (mostly chemical 
feedstock): 22%14; and other energy use (equipment, machinery, 
food and tobacco, textiles, leather, etc.): 27%. Energy use for material 
production and feedstock15 makes about three quarters (73%) of 
industrial energy consumption and is responsible for 77% of its 
increment in 2015–2019 (based on IEA 2021a).
For over a  century, industrial energy efficiency improvements 
have partially offset growth in GHG emissions. Industrial energy 
use per tonne of extracted materials (ores and building materials as 
a proxy for materials going through the whole production chain to 
final products) fell by 20% in 2000–2019 and by 15% in 2010–2019, 
accelerated driven by high energy prices to 2.4% yr–1 in 2014–2019, 
matching the values observed back in 1990–2000 (Figure  11.2). 
Assessed per value added using market exchange rates, industrial 
energy intensity globally dropped by 12% in 2010–2018, after its 
4% decline in 2000–2010, resulting in 2000–2018 decline by 15% 
(IEA 2020b,a). The 2020 COVID crisis slowed down energy intensity 
improvements by shifting industrial output towards more energy-
intensive basic materials (IEA 2020e). Specific energy consumption 
per tonne of iron and steel, chemicals and cement production in 2019 
was about 20% below the 2000 level (IEA 2020b,a). This progress 
is driven by moving towards best available technologies (BATs) for 
each product through new and highly efficient production facilities 
in China, India and elsewhere, and by the contribution from recycled 
scrap metals, paper and cardboard.
Physical energy intensity for the production of materials typically 
declines and then stabilises at the BAT level once the market is 
saturated, unless a transformative new technology enters the market 
(Gutowski et al. 2013; Crijns-Graus et al. 2020; IEA 2021a). Thus, the 
energy saving effect of switching to secondary used material comes 
to the forefront, as energy consumption per tonne for many basic 
primary materials approach the BATs. This highlights the need to push 
towards circular economy, materials efficiency, reduced demand, and 
Chapter 11 Industry11fundamental process changes (e.g., towards electricity and hydrogen-
based steel making). Improved recycling rates allow for a substantial 
reduction in energy use along the whole production chain – material 
extraction, production, and assembling  – which is in great excess 
of energy used for collection, separation, treatment, and scrap 
recycling minus energy used for scrap landfilling. The International 
Energy Agency (IEA 2019b) estimates that by increasing the recycling 
content of fabricated metals, average specific energy consumption 
(SEC) for steel and aluminium may be halved by 2060. Focusing on 
whole systems ‘integrative design’ expands efficiency resource much 
beyond the sum of potentials for individual technologies. Material 
efficiency coupled with energy efficiency can deliver much greater 
savings than energy efficiency alone. Gonzalez Hernandez et al. 
(2018b) stress that presently about half of steel or aluminium are 
scrapped in production or oversized for targeted services. They show 
that resource efficiency expressed in exergy as a single metric for both 
material and energy efficiency for the global iron and steel sector is 
only 33%, while secondary steel-making is about twice as efficient 
(66%) as ore-based production (29%). While shifting globally in ore-
based production from the average to the best available level can 
save 6.4 EJ yr–1, the saving potential of shifting to secondary steel-
making is 8 EJ yr–1, and is limited mostly by scrap availability and 
steel quality requirements.
11.2.2 New Trends in Emissions
GHG emissions attributable to the industrial sector (see Chapter 2) 
in 2019 originate from industrial fuel combustion (7.1 GtCO 2-eq 
directly and about 5.9 Gt indirectly from electricity and heat 
generation16); industrial processes (4.5 GtCO 2-eq) and products 
use (0.2 Gt), as well as from waste (2.3 Gt) (Figure  11.4a,b). 
Overall industrial direct GHG emissions amount to 14.1 GtCO 2-eq 
(Figure 11.4c and Table 11.1), and scales up to 20 GtCO 2-eq after 
indirect emissions are added,17 putting industry (24%, direct 
emissions) second after the energy sector in total GHG emissions 
and lifting it to the leading position after indirect emissions are 
allocated (34% in 2019).18 The corresponding shares for 1990–2000 
were 21% for direct emissions and 30% for both direct and indirect 
(Crippa et al. 2021; Lamb et al. 2021; Minx et al. 2021). As the 
industrial sector is expected to decarbonise slower than other 
sectors it will keep this leading position for the coming decades 
(IEA 2021a). In 2000–2010, total industrial emissions grew faster 
(3.8% yr–1) than in any other sector (see Chapter 2), mostly due to 


(IPPU) coverage exceeds the CO 2 emission assessed by the IEA (2021a) at 8.9 Gt for 2019 and at 8.4–8.5 Gt for 2020.

accounted for 43% in 2018.


Hertwich (2021) updated estimates for the global cradle-to-gate material-production-related GHG emissions for 2018 at 11.8 Gt (5.1 Gt for metals, 3.7 Gt for non-metallic 
minerals, 1.8 Gt for plastics and rubber, 1 Gt for wood) – which is about 69% of direct and indirect industrial emissions (waste excluded). These assessments are consistent 
as transportation of basic materials contributes around 1 GtCO 2-eq. to GHG emissions.

in machinery, vehicles, and electronics.the dynamics shown by basic materials extraction and production. 
Industry contributed nearly half (45%) of overall incremental global 
GHG emissions in the 21st century.
Industrial sector GHG emissions accounting is complicated by carbon 
storage in products (Levi and Cullen 2018). About 35% of chemicals’ 
mass is CO 2, which is emitted at use stage  – decomposition of 
fertilisers, or plastic waste incineration (Saygin and Gielen 2021), 
and sinks. Recarbonation and mineralisation  of alkaline industrial 
materials and wastes (also known as the ‘sponge effect’) provide 
0.6–1 GtCO 2 yr–1 uptake by cement-containing products19 (Cao et al. 
2020; Guo et al. 2021); see Section 11.3.6 for further discussion in 
decarbonisation context.
In 1970–1990, industrial direct combustion-related emissions were 
growing modestly, and in 1990–2000 even switched to a  slowly 
declining trend, steadily losing their share in overall industrial 
emissions. Electrification was the major driver behind both indirect 
and total industrial emissions in those years. This quiet evolution was 
interrupted in the beginning of the 21st century, when total emissions 
increased by 60–68% depending on the metric applied (the fastest 
growth ever seen). In 2000–2019 iron, steel and cement absolute 
GHGs increased more than any other period in history (Bashmakov 
2021). Emissions froze temporarily in 2014–2016, partly in the wake 
of the financial crisis, but returned to their growth trajectory in 
2017–2019 (Figure 11.4a).
The largest incremental contributors to industrial emissions in 
2010–2019 were industrial processes at 40%, then indirect emissions 
(25%), and only then direct combustion (21%), followed by waste 
(14%; Figure 11.4). Therefore, to stop emission growth and to switch 
to a zero-carbon pathway more mitigation efforts should be focused 
on industrial processes, product use and waste decarbonisation, along 
with the transition to low-carbon electrification (Hertwich et al. 2020).
Basic materials production dominates both direct industrial GHG 
emissions (about 62%, waste excluded)20 as well as direct industrial 
CO2 emissions (70%), led by iron and steel, cement, chemicals, and 
non-ferrous metals (Figure  11.4e). Basic materials also contribute 
60% to indirect emissions. In a  zero-carbon power world, with 
industry lagging behind in the decarbonisation of high-temperature 
processes and feedstock, it may replace the energy sector as the 
largest generator of indirect emissions embodied in capital stock.21

Figure 11.5 | Industrial sector greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 10 world regions (1990–2019).  Source: calculated based on emissions data from Crippa et al. 
(2021). Indirect emissions were assessed using IEA (2021b).
emissions embodied in buildings and infrastructure, machinery and 
transport equipment exceed 50% of their present carbon footprint.
In 1970–2000, direct GHG emissions per unit of energy showed 
a  steady decline interrupted by noticeable growth in 2001–2018 
driven by the fast expansion of steel and cement production 
(Figure  11.5; IEA 2021a). Non-energy-related GHG emissions per 
unit of extracted materials decline continuously, as the share of not 
carbon intensive building materials (aggregates and sand) grows.
|Iron and steel carbon intensity stagnated in 1995–2015 due to 
rapid growth in carbon-intensive production in some countries 
(Wang et al. 2021). For aluminium carbon intensity declined in 
2010–2019 by only 2% (International Aluminium Institute 2021a). The carbon intensity of cement-making since 2010 is down by only 
4%. In 1990–2019 it fell by 19.5%, mostly due to energy efficiency 
improvements (by 18.5%) as the carbon intensity of the fuel mix 
declined only by 3% (GCCA 2021b). Historical analysis shows the 
carbon intensity of steel production has declined with ‘stop and 
go’ patterns in 50–60-year cycles, reflective of the major jumps in 
best available technology (BAT). From 1900 to 1935 and from 1960 
to 1990 specific scope 1 + 2 + 3 emissions fell by 1.5–2.5 tCO 2 
per tonne, or as much as needed now to achieve net zero. While 
historical declines were mostly due to commissioning large 
capacities with new technologies, with total emissions growing, by 

low emission capacity replacements pushing absolute emissions to 
net zero (Bataille et al. 2021b).
Industry  Chapter 1111
11.2.3 Industrial Development Patterns and Supply 
Chains (Regional)
The dramatic increase in industrial emissions after 2000 is clearly 
associated with economic growth in Asia, which dominated both 
absolute and incremental emissions (Figure 11.5a,b).
More recent 2010 to 2019 trends show that regional contributions to 
additional emissions are distributed more evenly, while a large part 
still comes from Asian countries, where both rates of economic growth 
and the share of industrial emissions much exceed the global average. 
All other regions also contributed to total industrial GHG emissions. 
Structural shifts towards emissions from industrial processes and 
products use are common for many regions (Figure 11.5a).
Economic development. Regional differences in emission 
trends are determined by the differences observed in economic 
development, trade and supply chain patterns. The major source of industrial emissions is production of energy-intensive materials, 
such as iron and steel, chemicals and petrochemicals, non-ferrous 
metals and non-metallic products. Steel and cement are key inputs 
to urbanisation and infrastructure development (buildings and 
infrastructure are responsible for about three fourths of the steel 
stock). Application of a  ‘services-stock-flow-emissions’ perspective 
(Wiedenhofer et al. 2019; Bashmakov 2021; Haberl et al. 2021) shows 
that relationship patterns between stages of economic development, 
per capita stocks and flows of materials are not trivial with some 
clear transition points. Cao et al. (2017) mapped countries by four 
progressive stages in cement stock per capita S-shape evolution as 
a function of income and urbanisation: initial stage for developing 
countries with a  low level and slow linear growth; take-off stage 
with accelerated growth; slowdown stage; and finally a  shrinking 
stage (represented by just a few countries with very high incomes 
exceeding 40,000 USD2010 per capita) and urbanisation levels 
above 80%. Bleischwitz et al. (2018) use a similar approach with five 
stages to study material saturation effects for apparent consumption Table 11.1 | Dynamics and structure of industrial greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

Chapter 11 Industry11and stocks per capita for steel, cement, aluminium, and copper. This 
logic may be generalised to other materials from which in-use stock 
is built. While globally cement in-use stock is about 12 tonnes per 
capita, in developed countries it is 15–30 tonnes per capita, but the 
order of magnitude is lower in developing states with high per capita 
escalation rates (Cao et al. 2017). When stocks for some materials 
saturate – per capita stock peaks – the ‘scrap age’ is coming (Pauliuk 
et al. 2013a). Steel in-use stock has already saturated in advanced 
economies at 14 ±  2 tonnes per capita due to largely completed 
urbanisation and infrastructure developments, and a switch towards 
services-dominated economy. This saturation level is three to four 
times that of the present global average, which is below 4 tonnes 
per capita (Pauliuk et al. 2013a; Graedel et al. 2011; Wiedenhofer 
et al. 2019). China is entering the maturing stage of steel and cement 
consumption, resulting in a moderate projection of additional demand 
followed by expected industrial emissions peaking in the next 

Wu et al. 2019; Zhou et al. 2020). But many developing countries 
are still urbanising, and the growing need for infrastructure services 
results in additional demand for steel and cement. Materials intensity 
of the global economy is projected by OECD (2019a) to decline at 
1.3% yr–1 until 2060, driven by improving resource efficiency and 
the switch to circular economy, but with a projected tripling of global 
GDP it means a doubling of projected materials use (OECD 2019a). 
Under the business-as-usual scenario, India’s demand for steel may 
more than quadruple over the next 30 years (de la Rue du Can et al. 
2019; Dhar et al. 2020). In the IEA (2021a) net-zero-energy scenario, 
the saturation effect along with material efficiency counterbalances 
activity effects and keeps demand growth for basic materials modest 
while escalate demand for critical materials (copper, lithium, nickel, 
graphite, cobalt and others).
International trade and supply chain. In Equation 11.1 the share 
of allocated emissions (Dm) equals unity when territorial emission is 
considered, and to the ratio of domestically used materials to total 
material production for consumption-based emission accounting. 
Tracking consumption-based emissions provides additional insights 
in the global effectiveness of national climate policies. Carbon 
emissions embodied in international trade are estimated to account 
for 20–30% of global carbon emissions (Meng et al. 2018; OECD.Stat 
2019) and are the reason for different emissions patterns of OECD 
versus non-OECD countries (Chapter 2).
Based on OECD.Stat (2019) datasets, 2015 CO 2 emissions embodied 
in internationally traded industrial products (manufacturing and 
mining, excluding fuels) by all countries are assessed at 3  GtCO 2, 
or 30% of direct CO 2 emissions in the industrial sector as reported 
by Crippa et al. (2021). OECD countries collectively have reduced 
territorial emissions (shares of basic materials in direct emissions in 
those regions decline (Figure 11.5b), but demonstrated no progress 
in reducing outsourced emissions embedded in imported industrial 
products (Arto and Dietzenbacher 2014; OECD.Stat 2019). Accounting 
for net carbon emissions embodied in international trade of only 
industrial products (1283 million tCO 2 in 2015) escalates direct OECD 
industrial CO 2 emissions (1333 million tCO 2 of energy-related and 

1.5-fold for the EU, and more than triples it for the UK, while cutting (Dm) by a third for China and Russia (OECD.Stat 2019; IEA 2020f). In 
most OECD economies, the amount of CO 2 embodied in net import 
from non-OECD countries is equal to, or even greater than, the size 
of their Paris 2030 emissions reduction commitments. In the UK, the 
Parliament Committee on Energy and Climate Change requested that 
a consumption-based inventory be complementarily used to assess 
the effectiveness of domestic climate policy in delivering absolute 
global emissions reductions (Barrett et al. 2013; UKCCC 2019a). It 
should be noted that the other side of the coin is that exports from 
countries with lower production carbon intensities can lead to overall 
less emissions than if production took place in countries with high 
carbon intensities, which may become critical in the global evolution 
toward lower emissions. The evolution of Dm to the date was driven 
mostly by factors other than carbon regulation often equipped with 
carbon leakage prevention tools. Empirical tests have failed to date 
to detect meaningful ‘carbon leakage’ and impacts of carbon prices 
on net import, direct foreign investments, volumes of production, 
value added, employment, profits, and innovation in industry (Sartor 
2013; Branger et al. 2016; Saussay and Sato 2018; Ellis et al. 2019; 
Naegele and Zaklan 2019; Acworth et al. 2020; Carratù et al. 2020; 
Pyrka et al. 2020; Zachmann and McWilliams 2020). In the coming 
years, availability of large low-cost renewable electricity potential 
and cheap hydrogen may become a  new driver for relocation of 
such carbon intensive industries as steel production (Bataille 2020a; 
Gielen et al. 2020; Bataille et al. 2021a; Saygin and Gielen 2021).
11.3 Technological Developments and Options
The following overview of technical developments and mitigation 
options which relate to the industrial sector is organised in six 
equally important strategies: (i) demand for materials, (ii) materials 
efficiency, (iii) circular economy and industrial waste, (iv) energy 
efficiency, (v) electrification and fuel switching, and (vi) CCUS, 
feedstock and biogenic carbon. Each strategy is described in detail, 
followed by a  discussion of possible overlaps and interactions 
between strategies and how conflicts and synergies can be addressed 
through integration of the approaches.
11.3.1 Demand for Materials
Demand for materials is a  key driver of energy consumption and 
CO2 emissions in the industrial sector. Rapid growth in material 
demand over the last quarter century has seen demand for key 
energy-intensive materials increase 2.5- to 3.5-fold (Figure  11.6), 
with growth linked to, and often exceeding, population growth 
and economic development. The International Energy Agency (IEA) 
explains, ‘as economies develop, urbanise, consume more goods and 
build up their infrastructure, material demand per capita tends to 
increase considerably. Once industrialised, an economy’s material 
demand may level off and perhaps even begin to decline’ (IEA 2019b).
The Kaya-like identity presented earlier in the chapter (Equation 
11.1) suggests that material demand can be decoupled from 
population and economic development by two means: (i) reducing 
the accumulated material stock (MStock) used to deliver material 
Industry  Chapter 1111services; and (ii) reducing the material (MPR +  MSE) required to 
maintain material stocks (MStock). Such material demand reduction 
strategies are linked upstream to material efficiency strategies (the 
delivery of goods and services with less material demand, and thus 
energy and emissions) and to demand reduction behaviours, through 
concepts such as sufficiency, sustainable consumption and social 
practice theory (Spangenberg and Lorek 2019). Materials demand 
can also be influenced through urban planning, building codes 
and related socio-cultural norms that shape the overall demand 
for square metres per capita of floor space, mobility and transport 
infrastructures (Chapter 5).
Modelling suggests that per capita material stocks saturate (level 
off) in developed countries and decouple from GDP .  Pauliuk et al. 
(2013b) demonstrated this saturation effect in an analysis of in-use 
steel stocks in 200 countries, showing that per capita steel in stocks 
in countries with a long industrial history (e.g., USA, UK, Germany) 
had saturation levels between 11 and 16 tonnes. More recently, 
Bleischwitz et al. (2018) confirmed the occurrence of a  saturation 
effect for four materials (steel, cement, aluminium and copper) in 
four industrialised countries (Germany, Japan, UK and USA) together 
with China. These findings have led to the revision of some material 
demand forecasts, which previously had been based solely on 
population and economic trends.
The saturation effect for material stocks is critical for managing 
material demand in developed countries. Materials are required 
to meet demand for the creation of new stocks and the maintenance 
of existing stocks (Gutowski et al. 2017). Once saturation is attained 
the need for new stocks is minimised, and materials are only required for replacing old stocks and maintenance. Saturation allows material 
efficiency strategies (such as light-weight design, longer lifetimes, and 
more intense use) to reduce the required per capita level of material 
stocks, and material circularity strategies (closing material loops 
through remanufacture, reuse and recycling) to lessen the energy and 
carbon impacts required to maintain the material stock. However, 
it should be noted that some materials still show little evidence of 
saturation (i.e., plastics, see Box 11.2). Furthermore, meeting climate 
change targets in developed countries will require the construction 
of new low-carbon infrastructures (i.e., renewable energy generation, 
new energy distribution and storage systems, electric vehicles and 
building heating systems) which may increase demand for emissions 
intensive materials (i.e., steel, concrete and glass).
For developing countries, who are still far from saturation levels, 
strong growth for new products and the creation of new infrastructure 
capacity may still drive global material demand. However, there is an 
expectation that economic development can be achieved at lower 
per capita material stock levels, based on the careful deployment of 
material efficiency and circularity by design (Grubler et al. 2018).
11.3.2 Material Efficiency
Material efficiency (ME) – the delivery of goods and services with 
less material  – is increasingly seen as an important strategy for 
reducing GHG emissions in industry (IEA 2017, 2019b). Options to 
improve ME exist at every stage in the lifecycle of materials and 
products, as shown in Figure 11.7. This includes: designing products 
which are lighter, optimising to maintain the end-use service while 1990=100Steel

Chapter 11 Industry11minimising material use, designing for circular principles (i.e., longer 
life, reusability, repairability, and ease of high-quality recycling); 
pushing manufacturing and fabrication process to use materials and 
energy more efficiently and recover material wastes; increasing the 
capacity, intensity of use, and lifetimes of product in use; improving 
the recovery of materials at the end of life, through improved 
remanufacturing, reuse and recycling processes. For more specific 
examples see Allwood et al. (2012); Lovins (2018); Hertwich et al. 
(2019); Scott et al. (2019); and Rissman et al. (2020).
ME provides plentiful options to reduce emissions, yet because 
interventions are dispersed across supply chains and span many 
different stakeholders, this makes assessing mitigation potentials 
and costs more challenging. For this reason, ME interventions have 
traditionally been under-represented in climate change scenario 
modelling and integrated assessment models (IAMs) (Grubler et al. 
2018; Allwood 2018). However, two advances in the modelling of 
materials flows have underpinned the recent emergence of ME 
options being included in climate scenario modelling.
Firstly, over many years, the academic community has built up 
detailed global material-flow maps of the processing steps involved 
in making energy-intensive materials. Some prominent recent 
examples include: steel (Gonzalez Hernandez et al. 2018b), pulp 
and paper (Van Ewijk et al. 2018), petrochemicals (Levi and Cullen 
2018). In addition, material-flow maps at the regional and sectoral 
levels have flourished, for example: steel (Serrenho et al. 2016) and 
cement (Shanks et al. 2019) in the UK; automotive sheet-metal 
(Horton et al. 2019); and steel-powder applications (Azevedo et al. 
2018). The detailed and transparent physical mapping of material 
supply chains in this manner enables ME interventions to be traced 
back to where emissions are released, and allows these options to be 
compared against decarbonisation and traditional energy efficiency 
measures (Levi and Cullen 2018). For example, a recent analysis by Hertwich et al. (2019) makes the link between ME strategies and 
reducing GHG emissions in buildings, vehicles and electronics, while 
Gonzalez Hernandez et al. (2018a) examines leveraging ME as 
a climate strategy in European Union (EU) policy. Research to explore 
the combined analysis of materials and energy, using exergy analysis 
(for steel: Gonzalez Hernandez et al. 2018b) allows promising 
comparisons across industrial sectors.
Secondly, many ME interventions result in immediate GHG emissions 
savings (short-term), for example, light-weighting products, reusing 
today’s product components, and improving manufacturing yields. 
Yet, for other ME actions emissions savings are delayed temporally 
(long-term). For example, designing a  product for future reuse, or 
with a  longer life, only reaps emissions savings at the end of the 
product life, when emissions for a replacement product are avoided. 
Many durable products have long lifetimes (cars >10 years, buildings 
>40 years) which requires dynamic modelling of material stocks, over 
time, to enable these actions to be included in scenario modelling 
activities. Consequently, much effort has been invested recently 
to model material stocks in use, to estimate their lifetimes, and 
anticipate the future waste and replenishment materials to maintain 
existing stocks and grow the material stock base. Dynamic material 
models have been applied to material and product sectors, at the 
country and global level. These include, for example: vehicles stocks 
in the UK (Serrenho et al. 2017; Craglia and Cullen 2020) and in 
China (Liu et al. 2020); buildings stocks in the UK (Cabrera Serrenho 
et al. 2019), China (Hong et al. 2016; Cao et al. 2018, 2019) and 
the European Union (Sandberg et al. 2016); electronic equipment 
in Switzerland (Thiébaud et al. 2017); specific material stocks, such 
as cement (Cao et al. 2020, 2017), construction materials (Sverdrup 
et al. 2017; Habert et al. 2020), plastics (Geyer et al. 2017), copper 
(Daehn et al. 2017), and all metals (Elshkaki et al. 2018); all materials 
in China (Jiang et al. 2019), Switzerland (Heeren and Hellweg 2019) 
and the world (Krausmann et al. 2017).DESIGN

Figure 11.7 | Material efficiency (ME) strategies across the value chain.  Source: derived from strategies in Allwood et al. (2012).
Industry  Chapter 1111These two advances in the knowledge base have allowed the initial 
inclusion of some ME strategies in energy and climate change 
scenario models. The International Energy Agency (IEA) first created 
a ME scenario (MES) in 2015, with an estimated 17% reduction 
in industrial energy demand in 2040 (IEA 2015). The World Energy 
Outlook report includes a  dedicated sub-chapter with calculations 
explicitly on industrial material efficiency (IEA 2019c). They also 
include ME options in their modelling frameworks and reporting, 
for example for petrochemicals (IEA 2018a), and in the Material 
Efficiency in Clean Energy Transitions report (IEA 2019b). In Grubler 
et al. (2018) 1.5°C Low Energy Demand (LED) scenario, global 
material output decreases by 20% from today, by 2050, with one-
third due to dematerialisation, and two-thirds due to ME, resulting 
in significant emissions savings. Material Economics’ analysis of 
Industrial Transformation 2050 (Material Economics 2019), found 
that resource efficiency and circular economy measures (i.e.,  ME) 
could almost halve the 530 MtCO 2 yr–1emitted by the basic materials 
sectors in the EU by 2050. Finally, the Emissions Gap Report, UNEP 
(2019) includes an assessment of potential material efficiency 
savings in residential buildings and cars.
Clearly, more work is required to fully integrate ME strategies into 
mainstream climate change models and future scenarios. Efforts 
are focused on endogenising ME strategies within climate change 
modelling, assessing the synergies and trade-offs which exist 
between energy efficiency and ME interventions, and building up 
data for the assessment of emissions saved and the cost of mitigation 
from real ME actions. This requires analysts to work in cross-
disciplinary teams and to engage with stakeholders from across the 
full breadth of material supply chains. Efforts should be prioritised to 
foster engagement between the IAM community and emerging ME 
models based in the Life Cycle Assessment, Resource Efficiency, and 
Industrial Ecology communities (see also Sharmina et al. 2021).
11.3.3 Circular Economy and Industrial Waste
Circular economy (CE) is another effective approach to mitigate 
industrial GHG emissions and has been widely promoted worldwide 
since the fourth IPCC assessment report (AR4). From an industrial 
point of view, CE focuses on closing the loop for materials and energy 
flows by incorporating policies and strategies for more efficient 
energy, materials and water consumption, while emitting minimal 
waste to the environment (Geng et al. 2013). Moving away from 
a linear mode of production (sometimes referred to as an ‘extract-
produce-use-discard’ model), CE promotes the design of durable 
goods that can be easily repaired, with components that can be 
reused, remanufactured, and recycled (Wiebe et al. 2019). In particular, 
since CE promotes reduction, reuse and recycling, a large amount of 
energy and GHG-intense virgin material processing can be reduced, 
leading to significant carbon emission reductions. For example, in 
the case of aluminium, the energy efficiency of primary production 
is relatively close to best available technology (Figure 11.8), while 
switching to production using recycled materials requires only about 
5% as much energy (Section 11.4.1.4). However, careful evaluation 
is needed from a lifecycle perspective since some recycling activities may be energy- and emission-intensive, for example, the chemical 
recycling of plastics (Section 11.4.1.3).
As one systemic approach, CE can be seen as conducted at different 
levels, namely, at the micro level (within a single company, such as 
process integration and cleaner production), meso level (between 
three or more companies, such as industrial symbiosis or eco-
industrial parks) and macro level (cross-sectoral cooperation, such 
as urban symbiosis or a regional eco-industrial network). Each level 
requires different tools and policies, such as CE-oriented incentive 
and tax policies (macro level), and eco-design regulations (micro 
level). This section is focused on industry and a broader discussion of 
the CE concept is found in Box 12.2 and Section 5.3.4.2.
Micro level: More firms have begun to implement the concept of CE, 
particularly multi-national companies, since they believe that multiple 
benefits can be obtained from CE efforts, and it has become common 
across sectors (D’Amato et al. 2019). Typical CE tools and policies 
at this level include cleaner production, eco-design, environmental 
labelling, process synthesis, and green procurement. For instance, 
leading chemical companies are incorporating CE into their industrial 
practices, for example, through the design of more recyclable 
plastics, a differentiated and market-driven portfolio of resins, films 
and adhesives that deliver a total package that is more sustainable, 
cost-efficient and capable of meeting new packaging and plastics 
preferences. Problematically, at the same time the plastics industry 
is improving recyclability, it has, for example, been expanding into 
markets without recycling capacity (Mah 2021). Similarly, automakers 
are pursuing strategies to increase the portion of new vehicles that 
are fully recyclable when they reach the end of life, with increasing 
ambitions for using recycled material, largely motivated by end-of-
life vehicle regulations. This will require networks that are available 
to collect and sort all the materials in vehicles, and policy incentives 
to do it (Wiebe et al. 2019; Soo et al. 2021).
Meso level: Industrial parks first appeared in Manchester, UK, 
at the end of the 19th century and they have been implemented 
in industrialised countries for maximising energy and material 
efficiency, which also has merit for CO 2-emissions reduction, as stated 
in AR5. Industrial parks reduce the cost of infrastructure and utilities 
by concentrating industrial activities in planned areas, and  
are typically founded around large, long-term anchor companies. 
Complementary industries and services provided by industrial parks 
can entail diversified effects on the surrounding region and stimulate 
regional development (Huang et al. 2019a). This is crucial for small 
and medium enterprises (SMEs) because they often lack access to 
information and funds for sophisticated technologies.
Typical CE tools and policies at this level include sustainable 
supply chains and industrial symbiosis. A  common platform 
for sharing information and enhancing communication among 
industrial stakeholders through the application of information and 
telecommunication technologies is helpful for facilitating the creation 
of industrial symbiosis. The main benefit of industrial symbiosis is 
the overall reduction of both virgin materials and final wastes, as 
well as reduced/avoided transportation costs from by-product 
Chapter 11 Industry11exchanges among tenant companies, which can specifically help 
small- and medium-sized enterprises to improve their growth and 
competitiveness. From a climate perspective, this indicates significant 
industrial emission mitigation since the extraction, processing 
of virgin materials and the final disposal of industrial wastes are 
more energy intensive. Also, careful site selection of such parks can 
facilitate the use of renewable energy. Due to these advantages, 
eco-industrial parks have been actively promoted, especially in East 
Asian countries, such as China, Japan and the Republic of Korea 
(South Korea), where national indicators and governance exist (Geng 
et al. 2019). For instance, the successful implementation of industrial 
symbiosis at Dalian Economic and Technological Development 
Zone has achieved significant co-benefits, including GHG-emission 
reduction, economic and social benefits, and improved ecosystem 
functions (Liu et al. 2018). Another case at Ulsan industrial park, 
South Korea, estimated that 60,522 tonnes of CO 2 were avoided 
annually through industrial symbiosis between two companies 
(Kim et al. 2018b). The case of China shows the great potential of 
implementing these measures, estimating 111 million tonnes of CO 2 
equivalent will be reduced in 213 national-level industrial parks in 

national eco-industrial park project has reduced over 4.7 million 
tonnes of CO 2 equivalent through their industrial symbiosis efforts 
(Park et al. 2019). Meso-level CE solutions have been identified as 
essential for industrial decarbonisation (Section  11.4.3). Moreover, 
waste prevention as the top of the so-called ‘waste hierarchy’ can be 
promoted on the meso level for specific materials or product systems. 
For instance, the European Environment Agency published a report 
on plastic waste prevention approaches in all 28 EU-member states 
(Wilts and Bakas 2019). However, challenges exist for industrial 
symbiosis activities, such as inter-firm contractual uncertainties, 
the lack of synergy infrastructure, and the regulations that hamper 
reuse and recycling. Therefore, necessary legal reforms are needed to 
address these implementation barriers.
Macro level: The macro level uses both micro- and meso-level 
tools within a  broader policy strategy, addressing the specific 
challenge of CE as a cross-cutting policy (Wilts et al. 2016). More 
synergy opportunities exist beyond the boundary of one industrial 
park. This indicates the necessity of scaling up industrial symbiosis 
to urban symbiosis. Urban symbiosis is defined as the use of by-
products (waste) from cities as alternative raw materials for energy 
sources for industrial operations (Sun et al. 2017). It is based on 
synergistic opportunity arising from geographic proximity through 
the transfer of physical sources (waste materials) for environmental 
and economic benefits. Japan is the first country to promote urban 
symbiosis. For instance, the Kawasaki urban symbiosis efforts can 
save over 114,000 tonnes of CO 2 emissions annually (Ohnishi 
et al. 2017). Another simulation study indicates that Shanghai (the 
largest Chinese city) has the potential to save up to 16.8 MtCO 2 
through recycling all the available wastes (Dong et al. 2018). 
As such, the simulation of urban-energy-symbiosis networks in 
Ulsan, South Korea, indicates that 243,396 tCO 2–1 yr–1 emission 
and USD48 million yr–1 fuel cost can be saved (Kim et al. 2018a). 
Moreover, Wiebe et al. (2019) estimate that the adoption of the 
CE can lead to a  significantly lower global material extraction 
compared to a baseline. Their global results range from a decrease of about 27% in metal extraction to 8% in fossil fuel extraction 
and use, 8% in forestry products, and about 7% in non-metallic 
minerals, indicating significant climate change benefits. A macro-
perspective calculation on the circulation of iron in Japan’s future 
society shows that CO 2 emissions from the steel sector can be 
reduced by 56% as per the following assumptions: the amount 
recovered from social stock is the same as the amount of inflow, 
and all scrap was used domestically, and the export of steel 
products is halved (LCS 2018). A  key challenge is to go beyond 
ensuring proper waste management to setting metrics, targets 
and incentives to preserve the incorporated value in specific waste 
streams. Estimations for Germany have shown that despite recycling 
rates of 64% for all solid-waste streams, these activities only lead 
to a  resource-use reduction of only 18% (Steger et al. 2019). In 
general, the identification of the most appropriate CE method 
for different countries requires understanding and information 
exchange on background conditions, local policies and myriad 
other factors influencing material flows from the local up to the 
global level (Tapia Carlos et al. 2019). Also, an information platform 
should be created at the national level so that all the stakeholders 
can share their CE technologies and expertise, information (such 
as materials/energy/water consumption data), and identify the 
potential synergy opportunities.
11.3.4 Energy Efficiency
Energy efficiency in industry is an important mitigation option and 
central in keeping 1.5°C within reach (IPCC SR1.5). It has long been 
recognised as the first mitigation option in industry (Yeen Chan and 
Kantamaneni 2016; Nadel and Ungar 2019; IEA 2021a). It allows 
reduction of the necessary scale of deployment for low-carbon 
energy supplies and associated mitigation costs (Energy Transitions 
Commission 2018). The efficiency potentials are greatest in the non-
energy-intensive industries and are often relatively limited in energy-
intensive ones, such as steel (Pardo and Moya 2013; Kuramochi 2016; 
Arens et al. 2017). Deep decarbonisation in these subsectors requires 
fundamental process changes but energy efficiency remains important 
to reduce costs and the need for low-carbon energy supplies.
Below, we focus mainly on the technical progress and on new 
options that are reflected in the literature since AR5 and refer the 
reader there for a broader and deeper treatment of energy efficiency. 
Digitalisation and the development of industrial high-temperature 
heat pumps are two notable technology developments that can 
facilitate energy efficiency improvements.
Industrial energy efficiency can be improved through multiple 
technologies and practices (Tanaka 2011; Fawkes et al. 2016; Lovins 
2018; Crijns-Graus et al. 2020; IEA 2020a). There are two parallel 
processes in improvement of specific energy consumption (SEC): 
progress in energy-efficient BAT and moving the SEC of industrial 
plants towards BAT. Both slow down as theoretical thermodynamic 
minimums are approached (Gutowski et al. 2013). For the last 
several decades the focus has been on effective spreading of BAT 
technologies through application of policies for worldwide diffusion 
of energy-saving technologies (Section 11.6). As a result the SEC for 
Industry  Chapter 1111many basic primary materials is approaching BAT and there are signs 
that energy efficiency improvements have been slowing down over 
recent decades (IEA 2019d, 2020a, 2021a) (Figure 11.8).
11.3.4.1 Heat-use Energy Efficiency Improvement
While about 10% of global GHG emissions originate from combustion 
to produce high-temperature heat for basic material production 
processes (Sandalow et al. 2019), limited efforts have been made 
to decarbonise heat production. There is still a  large potential for 
using various grades of waste heat and the development of high-
temperature heat pumps facilitates its use. NEDO (2019) applies 
a ‘Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle’ concept for improved energy efficiency, 
and we use this frame our discussion of heat efficiency.
Reduce refers to reducing heat needs via improved thermal insulation, 
for example, where porous type insulators have been developed 
with thermal conductivity half of what is traditionally achieved by 
heat-resistant bricks under conditions of high compressive strength 
(Fukushima and Yoshizawa 2016). Reuse refers to waste heat 
recovery. A  study for the EU identified a  waste heat potential of 
about 300 TWh yr–1, corresponding to about 10% of total energy 
use in industry. About 50% of this was below 200°C, about 25% at 
temperatures 200°C–500°C, and 25% at temperatures of 500°C and 
above (Papapetrou et al. 2018). A survey conducted in Japan showed 
that 9% of the input energy is lost as waste heat, of which heat below 
199°C accounts for 68% and that below 149°C was 29% (NEDO 
2019). McBrien et al. (2016) identified that in the steel sector process 
heat recovery presently saves 1.8 GJ per tonne of hot rolled steel, 
while integrated across all production processes heat recovery with 
conventional heat exchange could save 2.5 GJ t–1, and it scales up to 3.0 GJ t–1 using an alternative heat exchange that recovers energy 
from hot steel. High-temperature industrial heat pumps represent 
a  new and important development for upgrading waste heat and 
at the same time they facilitate electrification. One recent example 
is a high-temperature heat pump that can raise temperatures up to 
165°C at a  coefficient of performance (COP) of 3.5 by recovering 
heat from unused hot water (35°C–65°C) (Arpagaus et al. 2018). 
Commercially available heat pumps can deliver 100°C–150°C but 
at least up to 280°C is feasible (Zühlsdorf et al. 2019). Mechanical 
vapour recompression avoids the loss of latent heat by condensation, 
then it acts as a  highly efficient heat pump with a  5–10 COP 
(Philibert 2017a).
Waste heat to power (WHP), or Recycle in NEDO’s terms, is also an 
under-utilised option. For example, a study for the cement, glass and 
iron industries in China showed that current technology enables only 
7–13% of waste heat to be used for power generation. With improved 
technologies, potentially 40–57% of waste heat with temperatures 
above 150°C could be used for power generation via heat recovery. 
Thermal power fluctuations can be a challenge and negatively affect 
the operation and economic feasibility of heat recovery power 
systems such as steam and/or organic Rankine cycle. In such cases, 
latent heat storage technology and intermediate storage units 
may be applied (Jiménez-Arreola et al. 2018). The development of 
thermoelectric conversion materials that produce power from unused 
heat and energy harvested from a higher temperature environment 
is also progressing, with several possible applications in industrial 
processes (Gayner and Kar 2016; Jood et al. 2018; Lv et al. 2018; 
Ohta et al. 2018). A potential early application in industry is to power 
wireless sensors, a  niche that uses microwatts or milliwatts, and 
avoid power cables (Champier 2017).GJ t–1MaxBAT

Chapter 11 Industry1111.3.4.2 Smart Energy Management
Energy management systems to reduce energy costs in an integrated 
and systematic manner were first developed in the 1970s, mainly in 
low-energy-resource countries, for example, by establishing energy 
managers and institutionalising management targets (Tanaka 2011). 
Strategic energy management has since then evolved and been 
promoted through the establishment of dedicated organisational 
infrastructures for energy-use optimisation, such as ISO-50001 
which specifies the requirements for establishing, implementing, 
maintaining, and improving an energy management system (Biel and 
Glock 2016; Tunnessen and Macri 2017). Digitalisation, sometimes 
referred to as Industry 4.0, facilitates further improvements in process 
control and optimisation through technology development involving 
sensors, communications, analytics, digital twins, machine learning, 
virtual reality, and other simulation and computing technologies 
(Rogers 2018), all of which can improve energy efficiency. One 
example is combustion control systems, where big data analysis of 
factors affecting boiler efficiency, operation optimisation and load 
forecasting have shown that it can lead to energy savings of 9% 
(Wang et al. 2017).
Smart energy systems with real-time monitoring allow for 
optimisation of innovative technologies, energy demand response, 
balancing of energy supply and demand including that on real-
time pricing, and product quality management, and prediction and 
reduction of idle time for workers and robots (ERIA 2016; Pusnik 
et al. 2016; ISO 2018; Legorburu and Smith 2018; Ferrero et al. 2020; 
Nimbalkar et al. 2020). The IEA estimated that smart manufacturing 
could deliver 15 EJ in energy savings between 2014 and 2030 (IEA 
2019d). Smart manufacturing systems that integrate manufacturing 
intelligence in real time through the entire production operation 
have not been yet widely spread in the industry. Examples have 
been demonstrated and integrated in real operation in the electrical 
appliance assembly industry (Yoshimoto 2016). Combining process 
controls and automation allows cost optimisation and improved 
productivity (Edgar and Pistikopoulos 2018).
11.3.5 Electrification and Fuel Switching
The principle of electrification and fuel switching as a GHG mitigation 
strategy is that industries, to the extent possible, switch their end uses 
of energy from a high GHG intensity energy carrier to a lower or zero 
intensity one, including both its direct and indirect production and 
end-use GHG emissions. In general, and non-exclusively, this implies 
a transition from coal (about 0.09 tCO 2 GJ–1 on combustion), refined 
petroleum products (about 0.07 tCO 2 GJ–1), and natural gas (about 
0.05 tCO 2 GJ–1) to biofuels, direct solar heating, electricity, hydrogen, 
ammonia, or net zero synthetic hydrocarbon fuels. Switching to these 
energy carriers is not necessarily lower emitting, however; how they 
are made matters.
Fuel switching has already been observed to reduce direct combustion 
CO2 emissions in many jurisdictions. There are significant debates 
about the net effect of upstream fossil fuel production and fugitive 
emissions, but observers have noted that in the case of US power generation it would take a leakage rate of about 2.7% from natural 
gas production to undo the direct fuel switching from coal mitigation 
effect, and the value is likely higher in most cases (Alvarez et al. 2012; 
Hausfather 2015). Coal mine methane emissions are also estimated 
to be substantially higher than previously assessed (Kholod et al. 
2020). Alvarez et al. (2018) estimated US fugitive emissions (not 
including the Permian) at 2.3% of supply, 60% more than previously 
estimated, while recent Canadian papers indicate fugitive emissions 
are at least 50% more than reported (Chan et al. 2020; MacKay et al. 
2021). However, given the potential for energy supply infrastructure 
lock-in effects (Tong et al. 2019), purely fossil fuel to fossil fuel 
switching is a limited and potentially dangerous strategy unless it is 
used very carefully and in a limited way.
Biofuels come in many forms, including ones that are nearly identical 
to fossil fuels but sourced from biogenic sources. Solid biomass, either 
direct from wood chips, lignin or processed pellets, is the most  commonly 
used renewable fuel in industry today and  is occasionally used in 
cement kilns and boilers. Biomethane, biomethanol, and bioethanol 
are all commercially made today using fermentation and anaerobic 
digestion techniques and are mostly ‘drop-in’ compatible with 
fossil fuel equivalents. In principle they cycle carbon in and out of 
the atmosphere, but their lifecycle GHG intensities are typically not 
GHG neutral due to land-use changes, soil carbon depletion, fertiliser 
use, and other dynamics (Hepburn et al. 2019), and are highly case 
specific. Most commercial biofuel feedstocks come from agricultural 
(e.g.,  corn) and food waste sources, and the feedstock is limited; 
to meet higher levels of biomass use a  transition to using higher 
cellulose feedstocks like straw, switchgrass and wood waste, available 
in much larger quantities, must be fully commercialised and deployed. 
Significant efforts have been made to make ethanol from cellulosic 
biomass, which promises much higher quantities, lower costs, and 
lower intensities, but commercialisation efforts, with a few exceptions, 
have largely not succeeded (Padella et al. 2019). The IEA estimates, 
however, that up to 20% of today’s fossil methane use, including by 
industry, could be met with biomethane (IEA 2020g) by 2040, using 
a mixture of feedstocks and production techniques. Biofuel use may 
also be critical for producing negative emissions when combined with 
carbon capture and storage (i.e., bioenergy with carbon capture and 
storage – BECCS). Most production routes for biofuels, biochemicals 
and biogas generate large side streams of concentrated CO 2 which 
is easily captured, and which could become a  source of negative 
emissions (Sanchez et al. 2018) (Section 11.3.6). Finally, it should be 
noted that biofuel combustion can, if inadequately controlled, have 
substantial negative local air quality effects, with implications for 
SDGs 3, 7 and 11.
There is a  large identified potential for direct solar heating in 
industry, especially in regions with strong solar insolation and sectors 
with lower heat needs (<180°C), for example, food and beverage 
processing, textiles, and pulp and paper (Schoeneberger et al. 
2020). The key challenges to adoption are site and use specificity, 
capital intensity, and a lack of standardised mass manufacturing for 
equipment and a supply chain to provide them.
Switching to electricity for end uses, or ‘direct electrification’, is 
a  highly discussed strategy for net zero industrial decarbonisation 
Industry  Chapter 1111(Lechtenböhmer et al. 2016; Palm et al. 2016; Åhman et al. 2017; 
Axelson et al. 2018; Bataille et al. 2018a; Davis et al. 2018; UKCCC 
2019b; Material Economics 2019). Electricity is a flexible energy carrier 
that can be made from many forms of primary energy, with high 
potential process improvements in terms of end-use efficiency (Eyre 
2021), quality and process controllability, digitisability, and no direct 
local air pollutants (McMillan et al. 2016; Jadun et al. 2017; Deason 
et al. 2018; Mai et al. 2018). The net-GHG effect of electrification 
is contingent on how the electricity is made, and because total 
output increases can be expected, for full effect it should be made 
with a very low GHG intensity primary source (i.e., <50 g  CO2 kWh–1: 
e.g.,  hydroelectricity, nuclear energy, wind, solar photovoltaics, or 
fossil fuels with 95+% carbon capture and storage (IPCC 2014)). This 
has strong implications for the electricity sector and its generation 
mix when the goal is a net-zero-emissions electricity system. Despite 
their falling costs, progressively higher mixes of variable wind and 
solar on a given grid will require support from grid flexibility sources, 
including demand response, more transmission, storage on multiple 
time scales, or firm low-to-negative emissions generation sources 
(e.g., nuclear energy, hydrogen fuel cells or turbines, biofuels, fossil or 
biofuels with CCS, and geothermal) to moderate costs (Jenkins et al. 
2018; Sepulveda et al. 2018; Williams et al. 2021). Regions that may 
be slower to reduce the GHG intensity of their electricity production 
will likely need to consider more aggressive use of other measures, 
like energy and material efficiency or bioenergy.
The long-term potential for full-process electrification is a  very 
sector-by-sector and process-by-process phenomenon, with differing 
energy and capacity needs, load profiles, stock turnover, capacity for 
demand response, and characteristics of decision-makers. Industrial 
electrification is most viable in the near term in cases with: minimal 
retrofitting and rebuild in processes; with relatively low local 
electricity costs; where the degree of process complexity and process 
integration is more limited and extensive process re-engineering 
would not be required; where combined heat and power is not used; 
where induction heating technologies are viable; and where process 
heating temperatures are lower (Deason et al. 2018).
For these reasons, lighter, manufacturing-orientated industries are 
more readily electrifiable than heavier industry like steel, cement, 
chemicals and other sectors with high heat and feedstock needs. 
Steam boilers, curing, drying and small-scale process heating, with 
typically lower maximum heat temperature needs (<200°C–250°C) 
are readily electrifiable with appropriate fossil-fuel-to-electricity 
price ratios (accounting for capital costs and efficiencies), and direct 
induction and infrared heating are available for higher temperature 
needs. These practices are uncommon outside regions with ample 
hydroelectric power due to the currently relatively low cost of 
coal, natural gas and heating oil, and especially when there is no 
carbon combustion cost. Madeddu et al. (2020) argue up to 78% of 
Europe’s industrial energy requirements are electrifiable through 
existing commercial technologies. In contrast, Mai et al. (2018) 
saw only a  moderate industrial heat supply electrification in their 
high-electrification scenario for the US. Electrification has also been 
explored in: raw and recycled steel (Fischedick et al. 2014b; Vogl et al. 
2018); ammonia (Bazzanella and Ausfelder 2017; Philibert 2017a); 
and chemicals (Palm et al. 2016; Bazzanella and Ausfelder 2017). While most chemical production of feedstock chemicals (e.g.,  H 2, 
NH3, CO, CH 3OH, C 2H4, C2H6 and C 2H5OH ) is done thermo-catalytically 
today, it is feasible to use direct electrocatalytic production, by itself 
or in combination with utilisation of previously captured carbon 
sources if a fossil fuel feedstock is used, or well-known bio-catalytic 
(e.g., fermentation) and thermo-catalytic processes (Bazzanella and 
Ausfelder 2017; De Luna et al. 2019; Kätelhön et al. 2019). It may even 
be commercially possible to electrify cement sintering and calcination 
through plasma or microwave options (Material Economics 2019).
Increased electrification of industry will result in increased overall 
demand for electricity. For example, 75 TWh of electricity was 
used by steel in the EU in 2015 (out of the 1000 TWh total used 
by industry), Material Economics (2019), varying between their new 
process, circularity and CCUS scenarios, projects increased demand 
to 355 (+373%), 214 (+185%) and 238 (+217%) TWh. These values 
are consistent with Vogl et al. (2018), which projects a  tripling of 
electricity demand in the German or Swedish steel industries if 
hydrogen-direct reduced iron and electric arc furnace steel-making 
(DRI EAFs) replaces BF-BOFs. Material Economics (2019) was 
conservative with its use of electricity in chemical production, making 
preferential use of biofeedstocks and some CCUS, and electricity 
demand still rose from 118 TWh to 510, 395 and 413 TWh in their 
three scenarios. Bazzanella and Ausfelder (2017), exploring deeper 
reductions from the chemical sector using more electrochemistry, 
projected scenarios with higher electricity demands of 960–4900 TWh 
(140% of the projected available clean electricity at the time) with 
maximum electricity use. In counterpoint, however, with revised 
wind capabilities and costs, the IEA (2019e) Offshore Wind Outlook 
indicates that ten times the current EU electricity use could be 
produced if necessary. Greater use of electro-catalytic versus thermo-
catalytic chemistry, as projected by De Luna et al. (2019), could 
greatly reduce these electricity needs, but the technology readiness 
levels are currently low. Finally, the UKCCC (2019b), which focused 
primarily on CCS for industry in its ‘Further Ambition’ scenario (the 
UK currently consumes about 300 TWh), in its supplementary ‘Further 
Electrification’ scenario projects an additional 300 TWh for general 
electrolysis needs and another 200 TWh for synthetic fuel production.
While it has been demonstrated that almost any heating end use 
can be directly electrified, this would imply very high instantaneous 
thermal loads for blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) steel 
production, limestone calcination for cement and lime production, and 
other end uses where flame-front (1000°C–1700°C) temperatures are 
currently needed. This indicates a possible need for another energy 
carrier to minimise instantaneous generation and transmission needs. 
These needs can be met at varying current and potential future costs 
using: bioliquids or gases hydrogen, ammonia, or net zero synthetic 
hydrocarbons or alcohols.
Broadly speaking, hydrogen can contribute to a  cleaner energy 
system in two ways: (i) existing applications of hydrogen 
(e.g.,  nitrogen fertiliser production, refinery upgrading) can use 
hydrogen produced using alternative, cleaner production methods; 
(ii) new applications can use low-GHG hydrogen as an alternative 
to current fuels and inputs, or as a complement to the greater use 
of electricity in these applications. In these cases – for example, in 
Chapter 11 Industry11transport, heating, industry (e.g., hydrogen-direct reduced iron and 
steel production) and electricity – hydrogen can be used in its pure 
form, or be converted to hydrogen-based fuels, including ammonia, 
or synthetic net zero hydrocarbons and alcohols such as methane 
or methanol (IEA 2019f). The IEA states that hydrogen could be 
used to help integrate more renewables, including by enhancing 
storage options and ‘exporting sunshine and wind’ from places 
with abundant resources; decarbonise steel, chemicals, trucks, ships 
and planes; and boost energy security by diversifying the fuel mix and 
providing flexibility to balance grids (IEA 2019f).
Around 70 Mt yr–1 of pure hydrogen is produced today: 76% from 
natural gas and 23% from coal, resulting in emissions of roughly 

direct and indirect emissions (waste excluded; Table  11.1). Fuels 
refining (about 410 MtCO 2 yr–1) and production of ammonia 
(420 MtCO 2 yr–1) largely dominate its uses. Another 45 Mt hydrogen is 
being produced along with other gases, on purpose or as by-products, 
and used as fuel, to make methanol or as a chemical reactant (IEA 
2019f). Very low and potentially zero GHG (depending on the energy 
source) hydrogen can be made via: electrolysis separation of water 
into hydrogen and oxygen (Glenk and Reichelstein 2019), also known 
as ‘green H 2’; electrothermal separation of water, as done in some 
nuclear plants (Bicer and Dincer 2017); partial oxidation of coal or 
naphtha or steam/auto methane reforming (SMR/ATR) combined 
with CCS (Leeson et al. 2017), or ‘blue H 2’; methane pyrolysis, where 
the hydrogen and carbon are separated thermally and the carbon 
is left as a solid (Abbas and Wan Daud 2010; Ashik et al. 2015), or 
via biomass gasification (Ericsson 2017), which could be negative 
emissions if the CO 2 from the gasification process is sequestered. All these processes would in turn need to be run using very low or 
zero GHG energy carriers for the resulting hydrogen to also be low 
in GHG emissions.
Ammonia production, made from hydrogen and nitrogen using 
the Haber-Bosch process, is the most voluminous chemical produced 
from fossil fuels, being used as feedstock for nitrogen fertilisers and 
explosives, as well as a cleanser, a refrigerant, and for other uses. 
Most ammonia is made today using methane as the hydrogen 
feedstock and heat source but has been made using electrolysis-
based hydrogen in the past, and there are several announced 
investments to resume doing so. If ammonia is used as a combustion 
fuel, care must be taken to avoid N 2O as a GHG and NO x in general 
as a local air pollutant.
Hydrogen can also be combined with low-to-zero net GHG carbon 
(Section  11.3.6) and oxygen and made into methane, methanol 
and other potential net zero synthetic hydrocarbons and alcohol 
energy carriers using methanation, steam reforming and Fischer-
Tropsch processes, all of which can provide higher degrees of storable 
and shippable high-temperature energy using known industrial 
processes in novel combinations (Bataille et al. 2018a; Davis et al. 
2018). If the hydrogen and oxygen is accessed via electrolysis, the 
terms ‘power-to-fuel’ or ‘e-fuels’ are often used (Ueckerdt et al. 
2021). Given their carbon content, if used as fuels, their carbon will 
eventually be oxidised and emitted as CO 2 to the atmosphere. This 
makes their net-GHG intensity dependent on the carbon source 
(Hepburn et al. 2019), with recycled fossil fuels, biocarbon and direct 
air capture carbon all having very different net-CO 2 impacts – see 
section 11.3.6 on CCS and CCU for elaboration.
Box 11.1 | Hydrogen in Industry
The ‘hydrogen economy’ is a long-touted vision for the energy and transport sectors, and one that has gone through hype-cycles 
since the energy crises in the 1970s (Melton et al. 2016). The widely varying visions of hydrogen futures have mainly been associated 
with fuel cells in vehicles, small-scale decentralised cogeneration of heat and electricity, and to a  certain extent energy storage 
for electricity (Eames et al. 2006; Syniak and Petrov 2008). However, nearly all hydrogen currently produced is used in industry, mainly for  
hydrotreating in oil refineries, to produce ammonia, and in other chemical processes, and it is mostly made using fossil fuels.
In the context of net zero emissions, new visions are emerging in which hydrogen has a central role to play in decarbonising industry. 
Near-term industrial applications for hydrogen include feeding it into ammonia production for fertilisers, while a more novel application 
would be as a replacement for coal as the reductant in steel-making, being piloted by the HYBRIT project in Sweden 2020–2021, 
and many companies have initiated hydrogen steel-making projects. As shown in Sections 11.3.5 and 11.3.6, there are many other 
potential applications of hydrogen, some of which are still relatively unexplored. Hydrogen can also be used to produce various lower-
GHG hydrocarbons and alcohols for fuels and chemical feedstocks using carbon from biogenic sources or direct air capture of CO 2 
(Ericsson 2017; Huang et al. 2020).
The geographical distribution of the potential for hydrogen from electrolysis powered by renewables like solar and wind, nuclear 
electrothermally produced hydrogen, and hydrogen from fossil gas with CCS may reshape where heavy industry is located, how 
value chains are organised, and what gets transported in international shipping (Bataille 2020a; Gielen et al. 2020; Bataille et al. 
2021a; Saygin and Gielen 2021). Regions with bountiful renewables resources, nuclear, or methane co-located with CCS geology may 
become exporters of hydrogen or hydrogen carriers such as methanol and ammonia, or home to the production of iron and steel, 
organic platform chemicals, and other energy-intensive basic materials. This in turn may generate new trade patterns and needs for 
bulk transport.
Industry  Chapter 111111.3.6 CCS, CCU, Carbon Sources, Feedstocks, and Fuels
Carbon is an important and highly flexible building block for a wide 
range of fuels, organic chemicals and materials including methanol, 
ethanol, olefins, plastics, textiles, and wood and paper products. In this 
chapter we define CCS as requiring return of CO 2 from combustion 
or process gases or ambient air to the geosphere for geological time 
periods (i.e., thousands of years) (IPCC 2005; IEA 2009; Bruhn et al. 
2016; IEA 2019g). CCU is defined as being where carbon (as CO or 
CO2) is captured from one process and reused for another, reducing 
emissions from the initial process, but is then potentially but not 
necessarily released to the atmosphere in following processes (Bruhn 
et al. 2016; Detz and van der Zwaan 2019; Tanzer and Ramírez 2019). 
In both cases the net effect on atmospheric emissions depends on the 
initial source of the carbon, be it from a fossil fuel, from biomass, or 
from direct air capture (Cuéllar-Franca and Azapagic 2015; Hepburn 
et al. 2019) and the duration of storage or use, which can vary from 
days to millennia.
While CCS and CCU share common capture technologies, what 
happens to the CO 2 and therefore the strategies that will employ 
them can be very different. CCS can help maintain near-CO 2 neutrality 
for fossil CO 2 that passes through the process, with highly varying 
partially negative emissions if the source is biogenic (Hepburn et al. 
2019), and fully negative emissions if the source is air capture, all 
not considering the energy used to drive the above processes. CCS 
has been covered in other IPCC publications at length, for example, 
IPCC (2005), and in most mitigation-oriented assessments since, 
for example, the IEA’s Energy Technology Perspectives (ETP) 2020 
and Net Zero scenario reports (IEA 2021a, 2020a). The potentials and 
costs for CCS in industry vary considerably due to the diversity of 
industrial processes (Leeson et al. 2017), as well as the volume and 
purity of different flows of CO 2 (Naims 2016); Kearns et al. (2021) 
provide a recent review. As a general rule it is not possible to capture 
all the CO 2 emissions from an industrial plant. To achieve zero or 
negative emissions, CCS would need to be combined with some use of 
sustainably sourced biofuel or feedstock, or the remaining emissions 
would need to be offset by carbon dioxide removal (CDR) elsewhere.
For concentrated CO 2 sources (e.g., cleaning of wellhead formation 
gas to make it suitable for the pipeline network, hydrogen 
production using steam methane reforming, ethanol fermentation, 
or from combustion of fossil fuels with oxygen in a  nitrogen-free 
environment, i.e.,  ‘oxycombustion’) CCS is already amenable to 
commercial oil and gas reinjection techniques used to eliminate 
hydrogen sulphide gas and brines at prices of USD10–40 tCO 2-eq–1 
sequestered (Wilson et al. 2003; Leeson et al. 2017). Most currently 
operating CCS facilities take advantage of concentrated CO 2 flows, 
for example, from formation gas cleaning on the Snoevit and Sleipner 
platforms in Norway, from syngas production for the Al Reyadah 
DRI steel plant in Abu Dhabi, and from SMR hydrogen production 
on the Quest upgrader in Alberta. Since concentrated process CO 2 
emissions are often exempted from existing cap and trade systems, 
these opportunities for CCS have largely gone unexploited. Many 
existing projects partially owe their existence to the utilisation of 
the captured CO 2 for enhanced oil recovery, which in many cases 
counts as both CCS and CCU because of the permanent nature of the CO 2 disposal upon injection if sealed properly (Mac Dowell et al. 
2017). There are several industrial CCS strategies and pilot projects 
working to take advantage of the relative ease of concentrated CO 2 
disposal (e.g.,  LEILAC for limestone calcination process emissions 
from cement production, HISARNA direct oxycombustion smelting 
for steel) (Bataille 2020a). An emerging option for storing carbon is 
methane pyrolysis by which methane is split into hydrogen and solid 
carbon that may subsequently be stored (Schneider et al. 2020).
There are several post-combustion CCS projects underway globally 
(IEA 2019g), generally focused on energy production and processing 
rather than industry. Their costs are higher but evolving downward – 
Giannaris et al. (2020) suggest USD47 tCO 2–1 for a  follow-up 
90% capture power generation plant based on learnings from the 
Saskpower Boundary Dam pilot – but crucially these costs are higher 
than implicit and explicit carbon prices almost everywhere, resulting 
in limited investment and learning in these technologies. A  key 
challenge with all CCS strategies, however, is building a gathering 
and transport network for CO 2, especially from dispersed existing 
sites; hence most pilot projects are  built near EOR/geological storage 
sites, and the movement towards industrial clustering in the EU and 
UK (UKCCC 2019b), and as suggested in IEA (2019f).
In the case of CCU, CO and CO 2 are captured and subsequently 
converted into valuable products (e.g., building materials, chemicals 
and synthetic fuels) (Styring et al. 2011; Bruhn et al. 2016; Artz et al. 
2018; Brynolf et al. 2018; Daggash et al. 2018; Breyer et al. 2019; 
Kätelhön et al. 2019; Vreys et al. 2019). CCU has been envisioned as part 
of the ‘circular economy’ but conflicting expectations on CCU and its 
association or not with CCS leads to different and contested framings 
(Palm and Nikoleris 2021). The duration of the CO 2 storage in these 
products varies from days to millennia according to the application, 
potentially but not necessarily replacing new fossil, biomass or direct 
air capture feedstocks, before meeting one of several possible fates: 
permanent burial, decomposition, recycling or combustion, all with 
differing GHG implications. While the environmental assessment 
of CCS projects is relatively straightforward, however, this is not 
the case for CCU technologies. The net-GHG mitigation impact of 
CCU depends on several factors (e.g., the capture rate, the energy 
requirements, the lifetime of utilisation products, the production 
route that is substituted, and associated room for improvement 
along the traditional route) and has to be determined by lifecycle CO 2 
or GHG analysis (e.g., Nocito and Dibenedetto 2020; and Bruhn et al. 
2016). For example, steel-mill gases containing carbon monoxide and 
carbon dioxide can be used as feedstock together with hydrogen for 
producing chemicals. In this way, the carbon originally contained in 
the coke used in the blast furnace is used again, or cascaded, and 
emissions are reduced but not brought to zero. If fossil-sourced CO 2 
is only reused once and then emitted, the maximum reduction is 50% 
(Tanzer and Ramírez 2019). The logic of using steel-mill CO and CO 2 
could equally be applied to gasified biomass, however, with a  far 
lower net-GHG footprint, likely negative, which CCU fed by fossil 
fuels cannot be if end-use combustion is involved.
Partly because of the complexity of the lifecycle analysis accounting, 
the literature on CCU is not always consistent in terms of the net-
GHG impacts of strategies. For example, Artz et al. (2018), focused not 
Chapter 11 Industry11just on GHG mitigation but multi-attribute improvements to chemical 
processes from reutilisation of CO 2, suggests the largest reduction 
in the absolute amount of GHGs from CO 2 reutilisation could be 
achieved by the coupling of highly concentrated CO 2 sources with 
carbon-free hydrogen or electrons from low GHG power in so called 
‘power-to-fuel’ scenarios. From the point of view of maximising 
GHG mitigation using surplus ‘curtailed’ renewable power, however, 
Daggash et al. (2018) instead indicates the best use would be for 
direct air capture and CCS. These results depend on what system is 
being measured, and what the objective is.
There are several potential crucial transitional roles for synthetic 
hydrocarbons and alcohols (e.g.,  methane, methanol, ethanol, ethylene, 
diesel and jet fuel) constructed using fossil, biomass or direct carbon 
capture (DAC) and CCU (Breyer et al. 2015; Dimitriou et al.  2015; 
Sternberg and Bardow 2015; Fasihi et al. 2017; Bataille et al. 2018a; 
Bataille 2020a). They can allow reductions in the GHG intensity of 
high-value legacy transport, industry and real estate that currently 
runs on fossil fuels but cannot be easily or readily retrofitted. They can 
be used by existing long-lived energy and feedstock infrastructure, 
transport and storage, which can compensate for seasonal supply 
fluctuations and contribute to enhancing energy security (Ampelli 
et al. 2015). Finally, they can reduce the GHG intensity of end uses 
that are very difficult to run on electricity, hydrogen or ammonia 
(e.g.,  long-haul aviation). However, their equivalent mitigation 
cost today would be very high (USD960–1440 tCO 2-eq–1), with 
the potential to fall to USD24–324 tCO 2-eq–1) with commercial 
economies of scale, with very high uncertainty (Hepburn et al. 2019; 
IEA 2020a; Ueckerdt et al. 2021).
A very large and important uncertainty is the long-term demand 
for hydrocarbon and alcohol fuels (whether fossil-, biomass- or 
DAC-based), chemical feedstocks (e.g.,  methanol and ethylene) 
and materials, and competition for biomass feedstock with other 
priorities, including agriculture, biodiversity and other proximate 
land-use needs, as well as need for negative emissions through 
BECCS. The current global plastics production of around 350 Mt yr–1 
is almost entirely based on petroleum feedstock and recycling rates 
are very low. If this or future demand were to be 100% biomass-
based it would require tens of exajoules of biomass feedstock (Meys 
et al. 2021). If demand can be lowered and recycling increased 
(mechanical as well as chemical) the demand for biomass feedstock 
can be much lower (Material Economics 2019). Promising routes in 
the short-term would be to utilise CO 2 from anaerobic digestion for 
biogas and fermentation for ethanol in the production of methane or 
methanol (Ericsson 2017); methanol can be converted into ethylene 
and propylene in a  methanol-to-olefins process and used in the 
production of plastics (Box 11.2). New process configurations where 
hydrogen is integrated into biomass conversion routes to increase 
yields and utilise all carbon in the feedstock are relatively unexplored 
(Ericsson 2017; De Luna et al. 2019).
There are widely varying estimates of the capacity of CCU to reduce 
GHG emissions and meet the net zero objective. According to Hepburn 
et al. (2019), the estimated potential for the scale of CO 2 utilisation in 
fuels varies widely, from 1 to 4.2 GtCO 2 yr–1, reflecting uncertainties 
in potential market penetration, requiring carbon prices of around USD40 to 80 tCO 2–1, increasing over time. The high end represents 
a future in which synthetic fuels have sizeable market shares, due 
to cost reductions and policy drivers. The low end – which is itself 
considerable – represents very modest penetration into the methane 
and fuels markets, but it could also be an overestimate if CO 2-
derived products do not become cost competitive with alternative 
clean energy vectors such as hydrogen or ammonia, or with direct 
sequestration. Brynolf et al. (2018) indicates that a key cost variable 
will be the cost of electrolysers for producing hydrogen. Kätelhön 
et al. (2019) estimate that up to 3.5 GtC yr–1 could be displaced from 
chemical production by 2030 using CCU, but this would require clean 
electricity equivalent to 55% of estimated global power production, 
at the same time other sectors’ demand would also be rising. 
Mac Dowell et al. (2017) suggest that while CCU, and specifically 
CO2-based enhanced oil recovery, may be an important economic 
incentive for early CCS projects (up to 4–8% of required mitigation 
by 2050), it is unlikely the chemical conversion of CO 2 for CCU will 
account for more than 1% of overall mitigation.
Finally, there is another class of CCU activities associated with 
carbonation of alkaline industrial wastes (including iron and steel 
slags, coal fly ash, mining and mineral processing wastes, incinerator 
residues, cement and concrete wastes, and pulp and paper mill 
wastes) using waste or atmospheric CO 2. Given the large volume 
of alkaline wastes produced by industry, capture estimates are as 
high as 4 GtCO 2 yr−1 (Cuéllar-Franca and Azapagic 2015; Ebrahimi 
et al. 2017; Kaliyavaradhan and Ling 2017; Pasquier et al. 2018; 
Huang et al. 2019c; Pan et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020) However, as 
some alkaline wastes are already used directly as supplementary 
cementitious materials to reduce clinker-to-cement ratios, and their 
abundant availability in the future is questionable (e.g., steel blast 
furnace slag and coal fly ash), there will be a  strong competition 
between mitigation uses (Section  11.4.2), and the potential for 
direct removal by carbonation is estimated at about 1  GtCO 2 yr−1 
(Renforth 2019).
The above CCU literature has identified that there may be a highly 
unpredictable competition between fossil, biogenic and direct air 
capture carbon to provide highly uncertain chemical feedstock, 
material and fuel needs. Fossil waste carbon will likely initially be 
plentiful but will add to net atmospheric CO 2 when released. Biogenic 
carbon is variably, partially net-negative, but the available stock will 
be finite and compete with biodiversity and agriculture needs for 
land. Direct air capture carbon will require significant amounts of 
low-GHG electricity or methane with high-capture rate CCS (Keith 
et al. 2018). There are clearly strong interactive effects between low-
carbon electrification, switching to biomass, hydrogen, ammonia, 
synthetic hydrocarbons via CCU, and CCS. 
11.3.7 Strategy Interactions and Integration
In this section we conceptually address interactions between service 
demand, service product intensity, product material efficiency, energy 
efficiency, electrication and fuel switching, CCU and CCS, and what 
conflicts and synergies may exist. Post AR5 a substantial literature 
has emerged, see Rissman et al. (2020), that addresses integrated 
Industry  Chapter 1111and interactive technical deep decarbonisation pathways for GHG-
intense industrial sectors, and how they interact with the rest of the 
economy (Denis-Ryan et al. 2016; Åhman et al. 2017; Wesseling et al. 
2017; Axelson et al. 2018; Davis et al. 2018; Bataille et al. 2018a; 
Bataille 2020a). It is a  common finding across this literature and 
a  related scenario literature (Energy Transitions Commission 2018; 
Material Economics 2019; UKCCC 2019a,b; IEA 2019b, 2020a; CAT 
2020; IEA 2021a) that deep decarbonisation of industry requires 
integrating all available options. There is no ‘silver bullet’ and so 
all behavioural and technological options have to be mobilised, 
with more emphasis required on the policy mechanisms necessary 
to engage a challenging transition in the coming decades in highly 
competitive, currently GHG-intense, price-sensitive sectors with 
long-lived capital stock (Wesseling et al. 2017; Bataille et al. 2018a; 
Bataille 2020a), discussed in the final section of this chapter.
While the strategies are not sequential and interact strongly, we 
discuss them in the order given. Reduced demand through reduced 
service demand and product intensity per service unit (Grubler 
et al. 2018; van Vuuren et al. 2018) reduces the need for the next six 
strategies. Greater material efficiency (see earlier sections) reduces 
the need for the next five, and so on – see Figure 11.9 above.
Circular economy introduces itself throughout, but mainly at the front 
end when designing materials and processes to be more materially 
efficient, efficient in use, and easy to recycle, and at the back end, 
when a material or product’s services life has come to end, and it 
is time for recycling or sustainable disposal (Murray et al. 2017; 
Korhonen et al. 2018). The entire chain’s potential will be maximised 
when these strategies are designed in ahead of time instead of 
considered on assembly, or as a retrofit (Allwood et al. 2012; Gonzalez 
Hernandez et al. 2018a; IEA 2019b; Material Economics 2019; Bataille 
2020a). For example, when designing a building: (i) Is the building 
shell, interior mass and ducting orientated for passive heating and 
cooling, and can the shell and roof have building-integrated solar PV 
or added easily, with hard-to-retrofit wiring already incorporated? 
(ii) Are steel and high-quality concrete only used where really needed 
(i.e., for shear, tension and compression strength), can sections be 
prefabricated off-site, can other materials be substituted, such as 
wood? (iii) Can the interior fittings be built with easy-to-recycle 
plastics or other sustainably disposable materials (e.g.,  wood)? 
(iv) Can this building potentially serve multiple purposes through its 
anticipated lifetime, are service conduits oversized and easy to access 
for retrofitting? (v) When it is time to be taken apart, can pieces 
be reused, and all componnents recycled at high purity levels, for 
example, can all the copper wiring be easily be found and removed, are the steel beams clearly tagged with their content? The answers to 
these questions will be very regionally and site specific, and require 
revision of educational curricula for the entire supply chain, as well 
as revision of building codes.
Energy efficiency is a  critical strategy for net zero transitions and 
enabling clean electrification (IEA 2021a). Improving the efficiency 
of energy services provision reduces the need for material intensive 
energy supply, energy storage, CCU and CCS infrastructure, and 
limits generation and transmission expansion to reduce an ever-
higherdemand, with associated generation, transmission, and 
distribution losses. Using electricity efficiently can help reduces peak 
demand and the need for peaking plants (currently often powered by 
fossil fuels), and energy storage systems.
Electrification and final energy efficiency are deeply entangled, 
because switching to electricity from fossil fuels in most cases 
improves GJ for GJ end-use energy efficiency: resistance heaters 
are almost 100% efficient, heat pumps can be 300–400% efficient, 
induction melting can improve mixing and temperature control, and 
electric vehicle motors typically translate 90–95% of input electricity 
to motor drive in contrast to 35–45% for a large, modern internal 
combustion engine. Overall, the combined effect could be 40% lower 
global final energy demand assuming renewable electricity is 
used (Eyre 2021).
There are potentially complicated physical and market fuel switching 
relationships between low-GHG electricity, bioliquids and gases, 
hydrogen, ammonia, and synthetic hydrocarbons constructed 
using CCU, with remaining CO2 potentially being disposed of 
using CCS. Whether or not they compete for a  wide range of end 
uses and primary demand needs will be regional and whether or 
not infrastructure is available to supply them. Regions with less 
than optimal renewable energy resources, or not sufficient to meet 
growing needs, could potentially indirectly import them as liquid or 
compressed hydrogen, ammonia or synthetic hydrocarbon feedstocks 
made in regions with abundant resources (Armijo and Philibert 2020; 
Bataille 2020a). Large-scale CCU and CCS applications need additional 
basic materials to build corresponding infrastructure and energy to 
operate it, thus reducing overall material and energy efficiencies.
There are different roles for different actors in relation to the different 
mitigation strategies (exemplified in Table 11.2), with institutions and 
supply chains developed to widely varying levels, for example, while 
energy efficiency is a relatively mature strategy with an established 
supply chain, material efficiency is not.Service

11.4 Sector Mitigation Pathways  
and Cross-sector Implications
This section continues the discussion of the various mitigation 
options and strategy elements introduced in Section 11.3 and makes 
them explicit for the most relevant industry sectors. For the various 
sectors, Section  11.4.1 concludes with a  tabular overview of key 
technologies and processes, their technology readiness level (TRL), 
potential timing of market penetration, mitigation potential and 
assessment of associated mitigation costs.
An integrated sequencing of mature short-term actions and less 
mature longer-term actions is crucial to avoid lock-in effects. Temporal 
implementation and discussion of the general quantitative role of 
the different options to achieve net zero emissions in the industrial 
sectors is core to the second part of the section (Section 11.4.2), where 
industry-wide mitigation pathways are analysed. This comprises 
the collection and discussion of mitigation scenarios available in the 
literature with a high technological resolution for the industry sector 
in addition to a set of illustrative global and national GHG mitigation scenarios selected from chapters  3 and 4, representing different 
GHG mitigation ambitions and different pathways to achieve 
certain mitigation targets. Comparing technology-focused sector-
based scenarios with more top-down-oriented scenario approaches 
allows for a  reciprocal assessment of both perspectives and helps 
to identify robust elements for the transformation of the sector. 
Comparison of real-world conditions within the sector (e.g., industry 
structure and logics, investment cycles, market behaviour, power, and 
institutional capacity) and the transformative pathways described 
in the scenarios helps researchers, analysts, governments, and all 
stakeholders understand the need not only for technological change, 
but for structural (e.g.,  new value chains, markets, infrastructures, 
and sectoral couplings) and behavioural (e.g., design practices and 
business models) change at multiple levels.
When undergoing a  transformative process, it is obvious that 
interactions occur within the sector but also on a  cross-sectoral 
basis. Relevant interactions are identified and discussed in the third 
and fourth part of the subsection. Changes are induced along the 
whole value chain, i.e., switching to an alternative (climate-friendly, Table 11.2 | Examples of the potential roles of different actors in relation to different mitigation strategies indicating the importance of engaging a wide

Industry  Chapter 1111e.g., low-GHG hydrogen-based) steel-making process has substantial 
impacts on the value chain, associated sub-suppliers, and electricity 
and coal outputs. In addition, cross-sectoral interactions are 
discussed. This includes feedback loops with other end-use chapters, 
for example, higher material demand through market penetration 
of some GHG mitigation technologies or measures (e.g., insulation 
materials for buildings, steel for windmills) and lower demand 
through others (e.g., less steel for fossil fuel extraction, transport and 
processing), or substantial additional demand of critical materials 
(e.g., the widely varying demands for copper, lithium, nickel, cobalt 
and rare earths for producing windmills, solar panels, and batteries). 
Generally, if consumption- (or behaviour-) driven additional material 
demand creates scarcity it becomes important to increase efforts 
on material efficiency, substitution, recycling/reuse, and sustainable 
consumption patterns.
11.4.1 Sector-specific Mitigation Potential and Costs
Based on the general discussion of strategies across industry 
in Section 11.3, this subsection focuses on the sector perspective and 
provides insights into the sector-specific mitigation technologies 
and potentials. As industry is comprised of many different subsectors, 
the discussion here has its focus on the most important sources 
of GHG emissions, that is, steel, cement and concrete, as well as 
chemicals, before other sectors are discussed.
11.4.1.1 Steel
For the period leading up to 2020, in terms of end-use allocation 
globally, approximately 40% of steel is used for structures, 
20%  for industrial equipment, 18% for consumer products, 
13% for infrastructure, and 10% for vehicles (Bataille 2020b). The 
global production of crude steel increased by 41% between 2008 
and 2020 (World Steel Association 2021) and its GHG emissions, 
depending on the scope covered, is 3.7–4.1 GtCO 2-eq. It represented 
20% of total global direct industrial emissions in 2019 accounting 
for coke oven and blast furnace gases use (Crippa et al. 2021; Lamb 
et al. 2021; Minx et al. 2021; Olivier and Peters 2018; World Steel 
Association 2021; IEA 2020a) (Figure  11.4 and Table  11.1). 
Steel production can be divided into primary production based on iron 
ore and secondary production based on steel scrap. The blast furnace-
basic oxygen furnace route (BF-BOF) is the main primary steel route 
globally, while the electric arc furnace (EAF) is the preferred process 
for the less energy and emissions-intensive melting and alloying of 
recycled steel scrap. The direct reduced iron (DRI) route is a lesser-
used route that replaces BFs for reducing iron ore, usually followed by 
an EAF . In 2019, 73% of global crude steel production was produced 
in BF-BOFs, while 26% was produced in EAFs, a nominal 5.6% of 
which is DRI (World Steel Association 2021).
An estimated 15% energy efficiency improvement is possible within 
the BF-BOF process (Figure  11.8). Several options exist for deep-
GHG emissions reductions in steel-production processes (Fischedick 
et al. 2014b; Leeson et al. 2017; Axelson et al. 2018; Vogl et al. 
2018; Bataille 2020a; Holappa 2020; Rissman et al. 2020; Fan and 
Friedmann 2021; Wang et al. 2021).Each could reduce specific CO 2 emissions of primary steel production by 80% or more relative to 
today’s dominant BF-BOF route if input streams are based on carbon-
free energy and feedstock sources or if they deploy high-capture CCS:
• Increasing the share of the secondary route can bring 
down emissions quickly and potential emissions savings are 
significant, from a global average 2.3 tCO 2–1 per tonne steel in 
BF-BOFs down to 0.3 (or less) tCO 2–1 per tonne steel in EAFs 
(Pauliuk et al. 2013a; Zhou et al. 2019), the latter depending on 
scrap preheating and electricity GHG intensity. However, realising 
this potential is dependent on the availability of regional and 
global scrap supplies and requires careful sorting and scrap 
management, especially to eliminate copper contamination 
(Daehn et al. 2017). There is significant uncertainty about how 
much new scrap will be available and usable (Xylia et al. 2018; 
IEA 2019b; Wang et al. 2021). Most steel is recycled already; 
the gains are mainly to be made in quality (i.e., separation from 
contaminants like copper). End-of-life scrap availability and its 
contribution to steel production will increase as in use stock 
saturates in many countries (Xylia et al. 2016).
• BF-BOFs with CCU or CCS. Abdul Quader et al. (2016) and Fan 
and Friedmann (2021) indicate that it would be difficult to retrofit 
BF-BOFs beyond 50% capture, which is insufficient for long-term 
emission targets but may be useful in some cases for avoiding 
cumulative emissions where other options are not available. 
However, BF-BOFs need their furnaces relined every 15–25 years 
(IEA 2021a; Vogl et al. 2021b), at a cost of 80–100% of a new 
build, and this would be an opportunity to build a new facility 
designed for 90%+ capture (e.g., fewer CO 2 outlets). This would 
depend upon access to transport to geology appropriate for CCS. 
• Methane-based syngas (hydrogen and carbon monoxide) 
direct reduced iron (DRI) with CCS.  Most DRI facilities 
currently use a  methane-based syngas of H 2 and CO as both 
reductant and fuel (some use coal). A  syngas DRI-EAF steel-
making facility has been operating in Abu Dhabi since 2016 that 
captures carbon emitted from the DRI furnace (where it is a co-
reductant with hydrogen) and sends it to a nearby oil field for 
enhanced oil recovery.
• Hydrogen-based direct reduced iron (H-DRI) is based on 
the already commercialised DRI technology but using only 
hydrogen as the reductant; pure hydrogen has already been used 
commercially by Circored in Trinidad 1999–2008. The reduction 
process of iron ore is typically followed by an EAF for smelting. 
During a  transitional period, DRI could start with methane or 
a  mixture of methane and hydrogen as some of the methane 
(≤30% hydrogen can be substituted with green or blue hydrogen 
without the need to change the process). If the hydrogen is 
produced based on carbon-free sources, this steel-production 
process can be nearly CO 2 neutral (Vogl et al. 2018).
• In the aqueous electrolysis route (small-scale piloted as 
Siderwin during the EU ULCOS programme), the iron ore is 
bathed in an electrolyte solution and an electric current is used 
to remove the oxygen, followed by an electric arc furnace for 
melting and alloying. 
• In the molten oxide electrolysis route, an electric current is 
used to directly reduce and melt the iron ore using electrolysis 
in one step, followed by alloying. These processes both promise 
Chapter 11 Industry11a significant increase in energy efficiency compared with the direct 
reduced iron (DRI) and blast furnace routes (Cavaliere 2019). If 
the electricity used is based on carbon-free sources, this steel-
production process can be nearly CO 2 neutral. Both processes 
would require supplemental carbon, but this is typically only up 
to 0.05% per tonne steel, with a  maximum of 2.1%. Aqueous 
electrolysis is possible with today’s electrode technologies, 
while molten oxide electrolysis would require advances in high-
temperature electrodes.
• The HIsarna® process is a  new type of coal-based smelting 
reduction process, which allows certain agglomeration stages 
(coking plant, sintering/pelletising) to be dispensed with. The 
iron ore, with a certain amount of steel scrap, is directly reduced 
to pig iron in a  single reactor. This process is suitable to be 
combined with CCS technology because of its relatively easy to 
capture and pure CO 2 exhaust gas flow. CO 2 emission reductions 
of 80% are believed to be realisable relative to the conventional 
blast furnace route (Abdul Quader et al. 2016). The total GHG 
balance also depends on further processing in a  basic oxygen 
furnace or in an EAF . The HIsarna process was small-scale piloted 
under the EU ULCOS program.
• Hydrogen co-firing in BF-BOFs can potentially reduce emission 
by 30–40%, referring to experimental work by the Course50 
projects and Thyssen Krupp, but coke is required to maintain 
stack integrity beyond that.
Reflecting the different conditions at existing and potential future 
plant sites, when choosing one of the above options a combination 
of different measures and structural changes (including electricity, 
hydrogen and CCU or CCS infrastructure needs) will likely be 
necessary in the future to achieve deep reductions in CO 2 emissions 
of steel production.
In addition, increases in material efficiency (e.g., more targeted steel 
use per vehicle, building or piece of infrastructure) and increases in 
the intensity of product use (e.g., sharing cars instead of owning them) 
can contribute significantly to reduce emissions by reducing the need 
for steel production. The IEA (2019b) suggested that up to 24% of 
cement and 40% of steel demand could be plausibly reduced through 
strong material efficiency efforts by 2060. Potential material efficiency 
contribution for the EU is estimated to be much higher – 48% (Material 
Economics 2019). Recycling would cut the average CO 2 emissions 
per tonne of steel produced by 60% (Material Economics 2019), but 
globally by 2050 secondary steel production is limited to 40–56% in 
various scenarios (IEA 2019b), with 46% in the IEA (2021a) and up 
to 56% in 2050 in Xylia et al. (2016). It may scale up to 68% by 2070 
(Xylia et al. 2016). CCU and more directly CCS are other options to 
reduce GHG emissions but depend on the full lifecycle net GHGs that 
can be allocated to the process (Section 11.3.6). Bio-based fuels can 
also substitute for some of the coal input, but due to other demands for 
biomass this strategy is likely to be limited to specific cases.
Abatement costs for these strategies vary considerably from case 
to case and for each a plausible cost range is difficult to establish; 
compare this with Table  11.3 (Fischedick et al. 2014b; Leeson 
et al. 2017; Axelson et al. 2018; Vogl et al. 2018; Fan and Friedmann 
2021; Wang et al. 2021). A key point is that while cost of production increases are significant, the effect on final end uses is typically 
very small (Rootzén and Johnsson 2016), with significant policy 
consequences (see Section 11.6 on public and private lead markets 
for cleaner materials).
11.4.1.2 Cement and Concrete
The cement sector is regarded as a sector where mitigation options 
are especially narrow (Energy Transitions Commission 2018; Habert 
et al. 2020). Cement is used as the glue to hold together sand, 
gravel and stone aggregates to make concrete, the most consumed 
manufactured substance globally. The production of cement has been 
increasing faster than the global population since the middle of the 
last century (Scrivener et al. 2018). Despite significant improvements 
in energy efficiency over the last couple of decades (e.g., a systematic 
move from wet to dry kilns with calciner preheaters feeding off the 
kilns), the direct emissions of cement production (the sum of energy 
and process emissions) are estimated to be 2.1–2.5 GtCO 2-eq in 2019 
or 14–17% of total global direct industrial GHG emissions (Lehne 
and Preston 2018; Bataille 2020a; Sanjuán et al. 2020; Crippa et al. 
2021; Hertwich 2021; Lamb et al. 2021) (Figure 11.4). Typically, about 
40% of these direct emissions originate from process heating (e.g., for 
calcium carbonate (limestone) decomposition into calcium oxide at 
850°C or higher, directly followed by combination with cementitious 
materials  at about 1450°C to make clinker), while 60% are process 
CO2 emissions from the calcium carbonate decomposition (Kajaste 
and Hurme 2016; IEA and WBCSD 2018; Andrew 2019). Some of the 
CO2 is reabsorbed into concrete products and can be seen as avoided 
during the decades-long life of the products; estimates of this flux 
vary between 15 and 30% of the direct emissions (Stripple et al. 
2018; Andersson et al. 2019; Schneider 2019; Cao et al. 2020; GCCA 
2021a). Some companies are mixing CO 2 into hardening concrete, 
both to dispose of the CO 2 and more importantly reduce the need for 
binder (Lim et al. 2019).
One of the simplest and most effective ways to reduce cement and 
concrete emissions is to make stronger concrete through better 
mixing and aggregate sizing and dispersal; poorly and well-made 
concrete can vary in strength by a factor of four for a given volume 
(Fechner and Kray 2012; Habert et al. 2020). This argues for a refocus 
of the market away from ‘one size fits all’, often bagged cements to 
professionally mixed clinker, cementitious material and filler mixtures 
appropriate to the needs of the end use.
Architects, engineers and contractors also tend to overbuild with 
cement because it is cheap as well as corrosion- and water-resistant. 
Buildings and infrastructure can be purposefully designed to 
minimise cement use to its essential uses (e.g., compression strength 
and corrosion-resistance), and replace its use with other materials 
(e.g., wood, stone and other fibres) for non-essential uses. This could 
reduce cement use by 20–30% (Imbabi et al. 2012; Brinkerhoff and 
GLDNV 2015; D’Alessandro et al. 2016; Lehne and Preston 2018; IEA 
2019b; Shanks et al. 2019; Habert et al. 2020).
Because so much of the emissions from concrete come from the 
limestone calcination to make clinker, anything that reduces use of 
clinker for a  given amount of concrete reduces its GHG intensity. 
Industry  Chapter 1111While 95% Portland cement is common in some markets, it is typically 
not necessary for all end-use applications, and many markets will add 
blast furnace slag, coal fly ash, or natural pozzolanic materials to 
replace cement as supplementary cementitious materials; 71% was 
the global average clinker content of cement in 2019 (IEA 2020a). 
All these materials are limited in volume, but a  combination of 
roughly two to three parts ground limestone and one part specially 
selected, calcined clays can also be used to replace clinker (Fechner 
and Kray 2012; Lehne and Preston 2018; Habert et al. 2020). Local 
building codes determine what mixes of cementitious materials are 
allowed for given uses and would need to be modified to allow these 
alternative mixtures where appropriate.
Ordinary Portland cement process CO 2 emissions cannot be 
avoided or reduced through the use of non-fossil energy sources. 
For this reason, CCS technology, which could capture just the 
process emissions (e.g., the EU LEILAC project, which concentrates 
the process emissions from the limestone calciner, see following 
paragraph) or both the energy and process-related CO 2 emissions, is 
often mentioned as a potentially important element of an ambitious 
mitigation strategy in the cement sector. Different types of CCS 
processes can be deployed, including post-combustion technologies 
such as amine scrubbing and membrane-assisted CO 2-liquefation, 
oxycombustion in a  low-to-zero nitrogen environment (full or 
partial) to produce a  concentrated CO 2 stream for capture and 
disposal, or calcium-looping (Dean et al. 2011). The IEA puts cement 
CCS technologies at the technology readiness level (TRL) 6–8 (IEA 
2020h). These approaches have different strengths and weaknesses 
concerning emission abatement potential, primary energy 
consumption, costs and retrofittability (Hills et al. 2016; Gardarsdottir 
et al. 2019; Voldsund et al. 2019). Use of biomass energy combined 
with CCS has the possibility of generating partial negative emissions, 
with the caveats introduced in Section 11.3.6 (Hepburn et al. 2019).
The energy-related emissions of cement production can also be reduced 
by using bioenergy solids, liquids or gases (TRL 9) (IEA and WBCSD 
2018), hydrogen or electricity (TRL 4  according to IEA (2020h)) for 
generating the high-temperature heat at the calciner – hydrogen and 
bioenergy co-burning could be complementary due to their respective 
fast-vs-slow combustion characteristics. In an approach pursued by the 
LEILAC research project, the calcination process step is carried out in 
a  steel vessel that is heated indirectly using natural gas (Hills et al. 
2017). The LEILAC approach makes it possible to capture the process-
related emissions in a comparatively pure CO 2 stream, which reduces 
the energy required for CO 2 capture and purification. This technology 
(LEILAC in combination with CCS) could reduce total furnace emissions 
by up to 85% compared with an unabated, fossil fuelled cement plant, 
depending on the type of energy sources used for heating (Hills et al. 
2017). In principle, the LEILAC approach allows the eventual potential 
electrification of the calciner by electrically heating the steel enclosure 
instead of using fossil burners.
In the long run, if some combination of material efficiency, better 
mixing and aggregate sizing, cementitious material substitution and 
90%+ capture CCS with supplemental bioenergy are not feasible in 
some regions or at all to achieve near-zero emissions, alternatives 
to limestone-based ordinary Portland cement may be needed. There are several highly regional alternative chemistries in use that provide 
partial reductions (Fechner and Kray 2012; Lehne and Preston 2018; 
Habert et al. 2020), for example, carbonatable calcium silicate clinkers, 
and there have been pilot projects with magnesium-oxide-based 
cements, which could be negative emissions. Lower carbon cement 
chemistries are not nearly as widely available as limestone deposits 
(Material Economics 2019), and would require new materials testing 
protocols, codes, pilots and demonstrations.
Any substantial changes in cement and concrete material efficiency 
or production decarbonisation, however, will require comprehensive 
education and continuing re-education for cement producers, 
architects, engineers, contractors and small, non-professional users 
of cements. It will also require changes to building codes, standards, 
certification, labeling, procurement, incentives, and a  range of 
polices to help create the market will be needed, as well as those 
for information disclosure, and certification for quality. Even an end-
of-pipe solution like CCS will require infrastructure for transport and 
disposal. Abatement costs for these strategies vary considerably 
from case to case and for each a plausible cost range is difficult to 
establish, but they are summarised in Table 11.3 from the following 
literature and other sources (Wilson et al. 2003; Fechner and Kray 
2012; Leeson et al. 2017; Moore 2017; Lehne and Preston 2018; IEA 
2019f; Habert et al. 2020).
11.4.1.3 Chemicals
The chemical industry produces a broad range of products that are 
used in a  wide variety of applications. The products range from 
plastics and rubbers to fertilisers, solvents, and specialty chemicals 
such as food additives and pharmaceuticals. The industry is the 
largest industrial energy user and its direct emissions were about 
1.1–1.7 GtCO 2-eq or about 10% of total global direct industrial 
emissions in 2019 (Olivier and Peters 2018; IEA 2019f; Crippa et al. 
2021; Lamb et al. 2021; Minx et al. 2021) (Figure 11.4 and Table 11.1). 
With regard to energy requirements and CO 2 emissions, ammonia, 
methanol, olefins, and chlorine production are of great importance 
(Boulamanti and Moya Rivera 2017). Ammonia is primarily used for 
nitrogen fertilisers, methanol for adhesives, resins, and fuels, whereas 
olefins and chlorine are mainly used for the production of polymers, 
which are the main components of plastics.
Technologies and process changes that enable the decarbonisation 
of chemicals production are specific to individual processes. Although 
energy efficiency in the sector has steadily improved over the past 
decades (Boulamanti and Moya Rivera 2017; IEA 2018a) (Figure 11.8), 
a significant share of the emissions is caused by the need for heat 
and steam in the production of primary chemicals (Bazzanella and 
Ausfelder 2017) (Box 11.2). This energy is currently supplied almost 
exclusively through fossil fuels which could be substituted with 
bioenergy, hydrogen, or low or zero carbon electricity, for example, 
using electric boilers or high-temperature heat pumps (Bazzanella 
and Ausfelder 2017; Thunman et al. 2019; Saygin and Gielen 2021). 
The chemical industry has among the largest potentials for industrial 
energy demand to be electrified with existing technologies, indicating 
the possibility for a  rapid reduction of energy-related emissions 
(Madeddu et al. 2020).
Chapter 11 Industry11The production of ammonia causes most CO 2 emissions in the 
chemical industry, about 30% according to the IEA (2018a) and 
nearly one third according to Crippa et al. (2021), Lamb et al. (2021) 
and Minx et al. (2021). Ammonia is produced in a catalytic reaction 
between nitrogen and hydrogen  – the latter most often produced 
through natural gas reforming (Stork et al. 2018; Material Economics 
2019) and in some regions through coal gasification, which has 
several times higher associated CO 2 emissions. Future low-carbon 
options include hydrogen from electrolysis using low- or zero-carbon 
energy sources (Philibert 2017a), natural gas reforming with CCS, or 
methane pyrolysis, a process in which methane is transformed into 
hydrogen and solid carbon (Bazzanella and Ausfelder 2017; Material 
Economics 2019; (Section 11.3.5 and Box 11.1). Electrifying ammonia 
production would lead to a decrease in total primary energy demand 
compared to conventional production, but a  significant efficiency 
improvement potential remains in novel synthesis processes (Wang 
et al. 2018; Faria 2021). Combining renewable energy sources 
and flexibility measures in the production process could allow for 
low-carbon ammonia production on all continents (Fasihi et al. 
2021). Steam cracking of naphtha and natural gas liquids for the 
production of olefins (i.e.,  ethylene, propylene and butylene), and 
other high-value chemicals is the second most CO 2-emitting process 
in the chemical industry, accounting for another almost 20% of the emissions from the subsector (IEA 2018a). Future lower-carbon 
options include electrifying the heat supply in the steam cracker as 
described above, although this will not remove the associated process 
emissions from the cracking reaction itself or from the combustion 
of the by-products. Further in the future, electrocatalysis of carbon 
monoxide, methanol, ethanol, ethylene and formic acid could allow 
direct electric recombination of waste chemical products into new 
intermediate products (De Luna et al. 2019).
A ranking of key emerging technologies with likely deployment dates 
from the present to 2025 relevant for the chemical industry identified 
different carbon capture processes together with electrolytic hydrogen 
production as being of very high importance to reach net zero 
emissions (IEA 2020a). Methane pyrolysis, electrified steam cracking, 
and the biomass-based routes for ethanol-to-ethylene and lignin-to-
BTX were ranked as being of medium importance. While macro-level 
analyses show that large-scale use of carbon circulation through CCU 
is possible in the chemical industry as primary strategy, it would be 
very energy intensive and the climate impact depends significantly 
on the source of and process for capturing the CO 2 (Artz et al. 2018; 
Kätelhön et al. 2019; Müller et al. 2020). Significant synergies can be 
found when combining circular CCU approaches with virgin carbon 
feedstocks from biomass (Bachmann et al. 2021; Meys et al. 2021).

carbon plastics.  Source: From Meys et al., “Achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emission plastics by a  circular carbon economy”. Science, 374(6563), 71–76,

Industry  Chapter 1111In a net zero world carbon will still be needed for many chemical 
products, but the sector must also address the lifecycle emissions of 
its products which arise in the use phase, for example, CO 2 released 
from urea fertilisers, or at the end of life, for example, the incineration 
of waste plastics which was estimated to emit 100 Mt globally in 

be achieved by closing the material cycles starting with material and 
product design planning for reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling of 
products – ending up with chemical recycling which yields recycled 
feedstock that substitutes virgin feedstocks for various chemical 
processes (Rahimi and García 2017; Smet and Linder 2019).However, 
the chemical recycling processes which are most well-studied are 
pyrolytic processes which are energy intensive and have significant 
losses of carbon to off-gases and solid residues (Dogu et al. 2021; 
Davidson et al. 2021). They are thus associated with significant CO 2 
emissions, which can even be larger in systems with chemical recycling 
than energy recovery (Meys et al. 2020). Further, the products from 
many pyrolytic chemical recycling processes are primarily fuels, 
which then in their subsequent use will emit all contained carbon 
as CO 2 (Vollmer et al. 2020). Achieving carbon neutrality would thus 
require this CO 2 either to be recirculated through energy-consuming 
synthesis routes or to be captured and stored (Geyer et al. 2017; 
Lopez et al. 2018; Material Economics 2019; Thunman et al. 2019). 
As all chemical products are unlikely to fit into chemical recycling 
systems, CCS can be used to capture and store a large share of their 
end-of-life emissions when combined with waste combustion plants 
or heat-demanding facilities like cement kilns (Leeson et al. 2017; 
Tang and You 2018).
Reducing emissions involves demand-side measures, for example, 
efficient end use, materials efficiency and slowing demand growth, 
as well as recycling where possible to reduce the need for primary 
production. The following strategies for primary production of 
organic chemicals which will continue to need a carbon source are 
key in avoiding the GHG emissions of chemical products throughout 
their lifecycles:
Recycled feedstocks:  Chemical recycling of plastics unsuitable 
for mechanical recycling was already mentioned. Through pyrolysis 
of old plastics, both gas and a  naphtha-like pyrolysis oil can 
be generated, a  share of which could replace fossil naphtha as 
a feedstock in the steam cracker (Honus et al. 2018a,b). Alternatively, 
waste plastics could be gasified and combined with low-carbon 
hydrogen to a  syngas, for example, the production and methanol 
and derivatives (Lopez et al. 2018; Stork et al. 2018). Other chemical 
recycling options include polymer selective chemolysis, catalytic 
cracking, and hydrocracking (Ragaert et al. 2017). Carbon losses and 
process emissions must be minimised and it may thus be necessary 
to combine chemical recycling with CCS to reach near-zero emissions 
(Thunman et al. 2019; Smet and Linder 2019; Meys et al. 2021).Biomass feedstocks: Substituting fossil carbon at the inception of 
a product lifecycle for carbon from renewable sources processed in 
designated biotechnological processes (Lee et al. 2019; Hatti-Kaul 
et al. 2020) using specific biomass resources (Isikgor and Becer 2015) 
or residual streams already available (Abdelaziz et al. 2016). Routes 
with thermochemical and catalytic processes, such as pyrolysis and 
subsequent catalytic upgrading, are also available (Jing et al. 2019).
Synthetic feedstocks: Carbon captured with direct air capture 
or from point sources (bioenergy, chemical recycling, or during 
a  transition period from industrial-processes-emitting fossil CO 2) 
can be combined with low-GHG hydrogen into a syngas for further 
valorisation (Kätelhön et al. 2019). Thus, low-carbon methanol can 
be produced and used in methanol-to-olefins/aromatics (MTO/MTA) 
processes, substituting the steam cracker (Gogate 2019) or Fischer-
Tropsch processes could produce synthetic hydrocarbons.
Reflecting the diversity of the sector, the listed options can only be 
illustrative. The above-listed strategies all rely on low-carbon energy 
to reach near-zero emissions. In considering mitigation strategies for 
the sector it will be key to focus on those for which there is a clear 
path towards (close to) zero emissions, with high (carbon) yields over 
the full product value chain and minimal fossil resource use for both 
energy and feedstocks (Saygin and Gielen 2021), with CCU and CCS 
employed for all remnant carbon flows. The necessity of combining 
mitigation approaches in the chemicals industry with low-carbon 
energy was recently highlighted in an analysis (Figure 11.10) which 
showed how the combined use of different recycling options, carbon 
capture, and biomass feedstocks was most effective at reducing 
global lifecycle emissions from plastics (Meys et al. 2021). While most 
of the chemical processes for doing all the above are well known 
and have been used commercially at least partly, they have not been 
used at large scale and in an integrated way. In the past, external 
conditions (e.g., availability and price of fossil feedstocks) have not 
set the necessary incentives to implement alternative routes and to 
avoid emitting combustion- and process-related CO 2 emissions to the 
atmosphere. Most of these processes will very likely be more costly 
than using fossil fuels and full-scale commercialisation would require 
significant policy support and the implementation of dedicated 
lead markets (Wesseling et al. 2017; Bataille et al. 2018a; Material 
Economics 2019; Wyns et al. 2019). As in other subsectors, abatement 
costs for the various strategies vary considerably across regions and 
products, making it difficult to establish a plausible cost range for 
each (Bazzanella and Ausfelder 2017; Philibert 2017a; Philibert 
2017b; Axelson et al. 2018; IEA 2018a; De Luna et al. 2019; Saygin 
and Gielen 2021).
Chapter 11 Industry11Box 11.2 | Plastics and Climate Change
The global production of plastics has increased rapidly over the past 70 years, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.4%, 
about 2.5 times the growth rate for global GDP (Geyer et al. 2017) and higher than other materials since 1970 (IEA 2019b). Global 
production of plastics is now more than 400 million tonnes, including synthetic fibres (IEA 2019b) The per capita use of plastics 
is still up to 20 times higher in developed countries than in developing countries with low signs of saturation and the potential 
for an increased use is thus still very large (IEA 2018a). Plastics is the largest output category from the petrochemical industry, 
which as a  whole currently uses about 14% of petroleum and 8% of natural gas (IEA 2018a). Forecasts for plastic production 
assuming continued growth at recent rates of about 3.5% point towards a doubled production by 2035, following record-breaking 
investments in new and increased production capacity based on petroleum and gas in recent years (CIEL 2017; Bauer and Fontenit 
2021). IEA forecasts show that even in a world where transport demand for oil falls considerably by 2050 from the current about 

plastic production as well as petroleum use, together with the lack of investments in breakthrough low-emission technologies, do not 
align with necessary emission reductions.
About half of the petroleum that goes into the chemical industry is used for producing plastics, and a significant share of this is 
combusted or lost in the energy-intensive production processes, primarily the steam cracker. GHG emissions from plastic production 
depend on the feedstock used (ethane-based production is associated with lower emissions than naphtha-based), the type of plastic 
produced (production of simple polyolefins is associated with lower emissions than more complex plastics such as polystyrene), 
and the contextual energy system (e.g., the GHG intensity of the electricity used) but weighted averages have been estimated to 
be 1.8 tCO 2-eq t–1 for North American production (Daniel Posen et al. 2017) and 2.3 tCO 2-eq t–1 for European production (Material 
Economics 2019). In regions more dependent on coal electricity production the numbers are likely to be higher, and several times 
higher for chemical production using coal as a feedstock – coal-based MTO has seven times higher emissions than olefins from steam 
cracking (Xiang et al. 2014). Coal-based plastic and chemicals production has over the past decade been developed and deployed 
primarily in China (Yang et al. 2019). The production of plastics was thus conservatively estimated to emit 1085 MtCO 2-eq yr–1 in 2015 
(Zheng and Suh 2019). Downstream compounding and conversion of plastics was estimated to emit another 535 MtCO 2-eq yr–1, while 
end-of-life treatment added 161 MtCO 2-eq yr–1. While incineration of plastic waste was the cause of only 5% of global plastic lifecycle 
emissions, in regions with waste-to-energy infrastructures this share is significantly larger, for example, 13% of lifecycle emissions 
in Europe (Ive Vanderreydt et al. 2021). The effective recycling rate of plastics remains low relating to a wide range of issues such as 
insufficient collection systems, sorting capacity, contaminants and quality deficiencies in recycled plastics, design of plastics integrated 
in complex products such as electronics and vehicles, heterogenous plastics used in packaging, and illegal international trade.
11.4.1.4  Other Industry Sectors
The other big sources of direct global industrial combustion and 
process CO 2 emissions are light manufacturing and industry (9.7% 
in 2016), non-ferrous metals like aluminium (3.1%), pulp and paper 
(1.1%), and food and tobacco (1.9%) (Bataille 2020a; Crippa et al. 
2021; Lamb et al. 2021).
Light manufacturing and industry
Light manufacturing and industry represent a very diverse sector in 
terms of energy service needs (e.g., motive power, ventilation, drying, 
heating, compressed air, etc.) and it comprises both small and large 
plants in different geographical contexts. Most of the direct fossil 
fuel use is for heating and drying, and it can be replaced with low-
GHG electricity through direct resistance, high-temperature heat 
pumps and mechanical vapour recompression, induction, infrared, 
or other electrothermal processes (Lechtenböhmer et al. 2016; 
Bamigbetan et al. 2017). Madeddu et al. (2020) argue up to 78% 
of Europe’s industrial energy requirements are electrifiable through 
existing commercial technologies and 99% with the addition of new 
technologies currently under development. Direct solar heating is possible for low temperature needs (<100°C) and concentrating solar 
for higher temperatures. Commercially available heat pumps can 
deliver 100°C–150°C but at least up to 280°C is feasible (Zühlsdorf 
et al. 2019). Plasma torches using electricity can be used where high 
temperatures (>1000°C) are required, but hydrogen, biogenic or 
synthetic combustible hydrocarbons (methane, methanol, ethanol, 
LPG, etc.) can also be used (Bataille et al. 2018a).
There is also a large potential for energy savings through cascading 
in industrial clusters similar to the one at Kalundborg, Denmark. 
Waste heat can be passed at lower and lower temperatures from 
facility to facility or circulated as low-grade steam or hot water, and 
boosted as necessary using heat pumps and direct heating. Such 
geographic clusters would also enable lower-cost infrastructure for 
hydrogen production and storage as well as CO 2 gathering, transport 
and disposal (IEA 2019f).
Aluminium and other non-ferrous metals
Demand for aluminium comes from a  variety of end uses where 
a reasonable cost, light-weight metal is desirable. It has historically 
been used in aircraft, window frames, strollers, and beverage 
Industry  Chapter 1111containers. As fuel economy has become more desirable and 
design improvements have allowed crush bodies made of 
aluminium instead of steel, aluminium has become progressively 
more attractive for cars. Primary aluminium demand is total 
demand (100 Mt yr–1 in 2020) net of manufacturing waste reuse 
(14% of virgin and recycled input) and end-of-life recycling (about 
20% of what reaches market). Primary aluminium consumption 
rose from under 20 Mt yr–1 in 1995 to over 66 Mt primary ingot 
production in 2020 (International Aluminium Institute change to 
2021c). The International Aluminium Institute (2021a) expects total 
aluminium consumption to reach 150–290 Mt yr–1 by 2050 with 
primary aluminium contributing 69–170 Mt and secondary recycled 
91–120 Mt (as in-use stock triples or quadruples). The OECD 
forecasts increases in demand by 2060 for primary aluminium to 

2019a).  Primary (as opposed to recycled) aluminium is generally 
made in a  two-stage process, often geographically separated. In 
the first stage aluminium oxide is extracted from bauxite ore (often 
with other trace elements) using the Bayer hydrometallurgical 
process, which requires up to 200°C heat when sodium hydroxide 
is used to leach the aluminium oxide, and up to 1000°C for kilning. 
This is followed by electrolytic separation of the oxygen from the 
elemental aluminium using the Hall-Héroult process, by far the most 
energy-intense part of making aluminium. This process has large 
potential emissions from the electricity used (12.5 MWh per tonne 
aluminium BAT, 14–15 MWh per tonne average). From bauxite mine 
to aluminium ingot, reported total global average emissions are 
between 12 and 17.6 tCO 2-eq per tonne of aluminium, depending 
on estimates and assumptions made22 (Saevarsdottir et al. 2020). 
About 10% of this, 1.5 tonnes of direct CO 2 per tonne of aluminium 
are currently emitted as the graphite electrodes are depleted and 
combine with oxygen, and if less than optimal conditions are 
maintained, perfluorocarbons can be emitted with widely varying 
GHG intensity, up to the equivalent of 2  tCO 2-eq per tonne of 
aluminium. PFC emissions, however, have been greatly reduced 
globally and almost eliminated in well-run facilities. Aluminium, if 
it is not contaminated, is highly recyclable and requires 1/20 of the 
energy required to produce virgin aluminium; increasing aluminium 
recycling rates from the 20–25% global average is a key emissions 
reduction strategy (Haraldsson and Johansson 2018).
The use of low- and zero-GHG electricity (e.g.,  historically from 
hydropower) can reduce the indirect emissions associated with 
making aluminium. A  public-private partnership with financial 
support from the province of Québec and the Canadian federal 
government has recently announced a  fundamental modification 
to the Hall-Héroult process by which the graphite electrode process 
emissions can be eliminated by substitution of inert electrodes. 
This technology is slated to be available in 2024 and is potentially 
retrofittable to existing facilities (Saevarsdottir et al. 2020).
Smelting and otherwise processing of other non-ferrous metals 
like nickel, zinc, copper, magnesium and titanium with less overall 
emissions have relatively similar emissions reduction strategies 

17.6 tCO 2-eq per tonne of primary aluminium. In the Beyond 2°C Scenario (B2DS) it is expected to be reduced to 2.5 tCO 2-eq per tonne.(Bataille and Stiebert 2018): (i) Increase material efficiency; 
(ii)  Increase recycling of existing stock; (iii) Pursue ore-extraction 
processes (e.g., hydro- and electro-metallurgy) that allow more use 
of low-carbon electricity as opposed to pyrometallurgy, which uses 
heat to melt and separate the ore after it has been crushed. These 
processes have been used occasionally in the past but have generally 
not been used due to the relatively inexpensive nature of fossil fuels.
Pulp and paper
The pulp and paper industry (PPI) is a  small net-emitter of CO 2, 
assuming the feedstock is sustainably sourced (Chapter 7), but it has 
large emissions of biogenic CO 2 from feedstock (700–800 Mt yr–1) 
(Tanzer et al. 2021). It includes pulp mills, integrated pulp and paper 
mills, and paper mills using virgin pulpwood and other fibre sources, 
residues and co-products from wood products manufacturing, and 
recycled paper as feedstock. Pulp mills typically have access to 
bioenergy in the chemical pulping processes to cover most or all of 
heat and electricity needs, for example, through chemicals recovery 
boilers and steam turbines in the kraft process. Mechanical pulping 
mainly uses electricity for energy; decarbonisation thus depends on 
grid emission factors. With the exception of the lime kiln in kraft 
pulp mills, process temperature needs are typically less than or 
equal to 150°C to 200°C, mainly steam for heating and drying. This 
means that this sector can be relatively easily decarbonised through 
continued energy efficiency, fuel switching and electrification, 
including use of high-temperature heat pumps (Ericsson and Nilsson 
2018). Electrification of pulp mills could, in the longer term, make 
bio-residues currently used internally for energy, available as 
a carbon source for chemicals (Meys et al. 2021). The PPI also has the 
capabilities, resources and knowledge, to implement these changes. 
Inertia is mainly caused by equipment turnover rates, relative fuel 
and electricity prices, and the profitability of investments.
A larger and more challenging issue is how the forestry industry 
can contribute to the decarbonisation of other sectors and how 
biogenic carbon will be used in a  fossil-free society, for example, 
through developing the forest-based bioeconomy (Pülzl et al. 2014; 
Bauer 2018). In recent years the concept of biorefineries has gained 
increasing traction. Most examples involve innovations for taking by-
products or diverting small streams to produce fuels, chemicals and 
bio-composites that can replace fossil-based products, but there is 
little common vision on what really constitutes a biorefinery (Bauer 
et al. 2017). Some of these options have limited scalability and the 
cellulose fibre remains the core product even in the relatively large 
shift from paper production to textiles fibre production.
Pulp mills have been identified as promising candidates for post-
combustion capture and CCS (Onarheim et al. 2017), which could allow 
some degree of net-negative emissions. For deep decarbonisation 
across all sectors, notably switching to biomass feedstock for fuels, 
organic chemicals and plastics, the availability of biogenic carbon (in 
biomass or as biogenic CO 2; Chapter 7) becomes an issue. A scenario 
where biogenic carbon is CCU as feedstock implies large demands 
Chapter 11 Industry11for hydrogen, completely new value chains and more closed carbon 
loops, all areas which are as yet largely unexplored (Ericsson 2017; 
Meys et al. 2021).
11.4.1.5 Overview of Estimates of Specific Mitigation Potential 
and Abatement Costs of Key Technologies and 
Processes for Main Industry Sectors
Climate-policy-related literature focusing on deep industrial emission 
reductions has expanded rapidly since AR5. An increasing body of 
research proposes deep decarbonisation pathways for energy-
intensive industries (Figure 11.13). Bataille et al. (2018a) address the 
question of whether it is possible to reduce GHG emissions to very 
low, zero, or negative levels, and identifies preliminary technological 
and policy elements that may allow the transition, including 
the use of policy to drive technological innovation and uptake. 
Material Economics (2019), the IEA (2019b), the Energy Transitions 
Commission (2018) and Climate Action Tracker (CAT; 2020) take 
steps to identify pathways integrating energy efficiency, material 
efficiency, circular economy and innovative technologies options to 
cut GHG emissions across basic materials and value chains. The key 
conclusion is that net zero CO 2 emissions from the largest sources 
(steel, plastics, ammonia, and cement) could be achieved by 2050 by 
deploying already available multiple options packaged in different 
ways (Davis et al. 2018; Material Economics 2019; UKCCC 2019b). 
The studies assume that for those technologies that have a kind of 
breakthrough technology status further technological development 
and significant cost reduction can be expected.
Table 11.3, modified from Bataille (2020a) and built from McMillan 
et al. (2016); Bazzanella and Ausfelder (2017); Philibert (2017a); 
Wesseling et al. (2017); Axelson et al. (2018); Bataille et al. (2018a) 
Davis et al. (2018); Energy Transitions Commission (2018); IEA 
(2019f, 2020c); Material Economics (2019); and UKCCC (2019b), 
presents carbon intensities that could be achieved by implementing 
mitigation options in major basic material industries, mitigation 
potential, estimates for mitigation costs, TRL and potential year of 
market introduction (Figure 11.13).
Table  11.3 acknowledges that for many carbon-intensive products 
a large variety of novel processes, inputs and practices capable of 
providing very deep emission reductions are already available and 
emerging. However, their application is subject to different economic 
and structural limitations, therefore in the scenarios assuming deep 
decarbonisation by 2050–2060 different technological mixes can be 
observed (Section 11.4.2).
While deep GHG emissions reduction potential is assessed for 
various regions, assessment of associated costs is limited to only 
a few regions; nevertheless those analyses may be illustrative at the 
global scale. UKCCC (2019b) provides costs assessments for different 
industrial subsectors (Table  11.3) for the UK.  They provide three 
ranges: core, more ambitious, and when energy and material efficiency 
are limited. The core options range from 2–85 GBP2019 tCO 2-eq–1 
(e.g., reduction in GHG emissions by about 50% by 2050 applying 
energy efficiency (EE), ME, CCS, biomass and electrification). The 
more ambitious options are estimated  at 32–119 GBP2019 tCO 2-eq–1 (e.g.,  90% emissions reduction via widespread deployment of 
hydrogen, electrification or bioenergy for stationary industrial heat/
combustion). Finally, costs range from 33–299 GBP tCO 2-eq–1 when 
energy and material efficiency are limited.
In Material Economics (2019), costs are provided for separate 
technologies and subsectors, and also by pathways, each including 
new industrial processes, circular economy and CCS components 
in different proportions, allowing for the transition to net zero 
industrial emission in the EU by 2050. That means that the study 
provides information about the three main mid- to long-term 
options which could enable a  wide abatement of GHG emissions. 
Given different electricity-price scenarios, average abatement costs 
associated with the circular economy-dominated pathway are:  
12–75  EUR2019 tCO 2-eq–1; for the carbon capture-dominated 
pathway 79 EUR2019 tCO 2-eq–1; and for the new processes-
dominated scenario 91 EUR2019 tCO 2-eq–1. Consequently, net-
zero-emission pathways are about 3–25% costlier compared to 
the baseline (Material Economics 2019). According to the Energy 
Transitions Commission (2018), cement decarbonisation would cost 
on average USD110–130 tCO 2–1 depending on the cost scenario. 
Rootzén and Johnsson (2016) state that CO 2 avoidance costs for 
the cement industry vary from 25 to 110 EUR tCO 2–1, depending on 
the capture option considered and on the assumptions made with 
respect to the different cost items involved. According to the Energy 
Transitions Commission (2018), steel can be decarbonised on average 
at USD60 tCO 2–1, with highly varying costs depending on low-carbon 
electricity prices.
For customers of final products, information on the potential 
impact of supply-side decarbonisation on final prices may be more 
useful than that of CO 2 abatement costs. A different approach has 
been developed to assess the costs of mitigation by estimating 
the potential impacts of supply-side decarbonisation on final 
product prices. Material Economics (2019) shows that with deep 
decarbonisation, depending on the pathway, steel costs grow by 
20–30%; plastics by 20–45%; ammonia by 15–60%; and cement 
(not concrete) by 70–115%. While these are large and problematic 
cost increases for material producers working with low margins in 
a competitive market, final end-use product price increases are far 
less, for example, a  car becomes 0.5% more expensive, supported 
by both Rootzén and Johnsson (2016) and the Energy Transitions 
Commission (2018). For comparison, Rootzén and Johnsson (2017) 
found that decarbonising cement-making, while doubling the cost 
of cement, would add <1% to the costs of a  residential building; 
the Energy Transitions Commission (2018) found concrete would be 
10–30% more expensive, adding USD15,000 or 3% to the price of 
a house including land value. Finally, the IEA (2020a) estimated the 
impact on end-use prices are rather small, even in a net zero scenario; 
they find price increases of 0.2% for a car and 0.6% for a house, 
based on higher costs for steel and cement respectively.
Thus, the price impact scales down going across the value chain and 
might be acceptable for a significant share of customers. However, 
it has to be reflected that the cumulative price increase could be 
more significant if several different zero-carbon materials (e.g., steel, 
plastics and aluminium) in the production process of a certain product

11.4.2 Transformation Pathways
To discuss the general role and temporal implementation of the 
different options for achieving a net zero GHG emissions industry, 
mitigation pathways will be analysed. This starts with showing the results of IAM-based scenarios followed by specific studies which 
provide much higher technological resolution and allow a  much 
deeper look into the interplay of different mitigation strategies. The 
comparison of more technology-focused sector-based scenarios 
with top-down-oriented scenarios provides the opportunity for 
a reciprocal assessment across different modelling philosophies and 
helps to identify robust elements for the transformation of the sector.

11.4.2.1 Central Results From (Top-down) Scenarios Analysis 
and Illustrative Mitigation Pathways Discussion
Chapter 3 conducted a comprehensive analysis of scenarios based 
on IAMs. The resulting database comprises more than 1000 model-
based scenarios published in the literature. The scenarios span 
a broad range along temperature categories from rather baseline-like 
scenarios to the description of pathways that are compatible with 
the 1.5°C target. Comparative discussion of scenarios allows some 
insights with regard to the relevance of mitigation strategies for the 
industry sector (Figure 11.11).
The main results from the Chapter  3  analysis from an industry 
perspective are:
• While all scenarios show a decline in energy and carbon intensity 
over time, final energy demand and associated industry-related 
CO2 emissions increase in many scenarios. Only ambitious 
scenarios (category C1) show significant reduction in final 
energy demand in 2030, more or less constant demand in 2050, but increasing demand in 2100, driven by growing material use 
throughout the 21st century. While carbon intensity shrinks over 
time, energy related CO 2-emissions decline after 2030 even in 
less ambitious scenarios, but particularly in those pursuing 
a temperature increase below 2°C. Reduction of CO 2 emissions 
in the sector are achieved through a combination of technologies 
which includes nearly all options that have been discussed in 
this chapter (Sections 11.3 and 11.4.1). However, there are big 
differences with regard to the intensity by which the various 
options are implemented in the scenarios.  This is particularly 
true for CCS for industrial applications and material efficiency 
and material demand management (i.e., service demand, service 
product intensity). The latter options are still under-represented 
in many global IAMs.
• There are only a  few scenarios which allow net-negative CO 2 
emissions for the industry for the second half of the century, 
while most scenarios assessed (including the majority of 1.5°C 
scenarios) end up with still significant positive CO 2 emissions. In 
comparison to the whole system most scenarios expect a slower 
decrease of industry-related emissions.
• There is a great – up to a factor of two – difference in assumptions 
about the GHG mitigation potential associated with different

Chapter 11 Industry11detailed. Due to their top-down perspective IAMs to date have not 
been able to represent the high complexity of industries in terms 
of the broad variety of technologies and processes (particularly 
circularity aspects) and to fully reflect the dynamics of the sector. 
In addition, as energy and carbon price elasticities are still not 
completely understood, primarily cost-driven models have their 
limitations. However, there are several ongoing activities to bring 
more engineering knowledge and technological details into the 
IAM models (Kermeli et al. 2021).
In addition to the more aggregated discussion, the IAMs illustrative 
mitigation pathways (IMPs) allow a deeper look into the transformation 
pathways related to the scenarios. For the illustrative mitigation 
pathways (IMPs) approach, sets of scenarios have been selected which 
represent different levels of GHG mitigation ambitions, scenarios 
which rely on different key strategies or even exclude some mitigation 
options, represent delayed actions or SDG-oriented pathways. For more 
detailed information about the selection see Section 3.3.2. Figure 11.12 
compares for a selected number of key variables the results of IMPs 
and puts them in the context of the whole sample of IAMs scenario 
results for three temperature categories.With growing mitigation ambition final energy demand is significantly 
lower in comparison of a current policy pathway (CurPol) and a scenario 
that explores the impact of further moderate actions (ModAct). Based 
on the underlying assumptions, scenarios IMP-SP and IMP-LD are 
characterised by the lowest final energy demand, triggered by high 
energy efficiency improvement rates as well as additional demand side 
measures, while a scenario with extensive use of CDR in the industry 
and the energy sectors to achieve net-negative emissions (IMP-Neg) 
leads to a significant increase in final energy demand. Scenario IMP-GS 
represents a pathway where mitigation action is gradually strengthened 
by 2030 compared to pre-COP 26 Nationally Determined Contributions 
(NDCs) shows the lowest final energy demand. All ambitious IMPs show 
substantially increasing contributions from electricity, with electricity’s 
end-use share more than doubling for some of them by 2050 and more 
than tripling by 2100. The share of hydrogen shows a flatter curve for 
many scenarios, reaching 5% (IMP-Ren) in 2050 and up to 20% in 2100 
for some scenarios (Ren, LD). Those scenarios that have a strong focus 
on renewable energy electrification show high shares of hydrogen in 
the sector. In comparison to sector-specific and national studies which 
show typically a range between 5 and 15% by 2050, many IAM IMPs 
expect hydrogen to play a less important role. Results for industrial CCS

Indicators in the Illustrative Mitigation Pathways (lines) and the 5–95% range of reference, 1.5°C and 2°C scenarios (shaded areas). The selected IMPs reflect the following 
characteristics: opportunities for reducing demand (IMP-LD; low demand), the role of deep renewable energy penetration and electrification (IMP-Ren; renewables), extensive 
use of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) in the industry and the energy sectors to achieve net-negative emissions (IMP-Neg), insights into how shifting development can lead 
to deep emission reductions and achieve sustainable development goals (IMP-SP; shifting pathways), and insights into how slower short-term emissions reductions can be 
compensated by very fast emission reductions later on (IMP-GS; gradual strengthening). Furthermore, two scenarios were selected to illustrate the consequences of current 
policies and pledges; these are CurPol (Current Policies) and ModAct (Moderate Action), and are referred to as Pathways Illustrative of Higher Emissions. Source: data are from 
the AR6 database; only scenarios that pass the vetting criteria are included (Section 3.2).
Industry  Chapter 1111show a  broad variety of contributions, with the GS scenario (where 
hydrogen is not relevant as a mitigation option) representing the upper 
bound to 2050, with almost 2 GtCO 2 yr–1 captured and stored by 2050. 
Beyond 2050 the upper bound is associated with scenario IMP-Neg 
associated with extensive use of CDR in the industry and energy 
sectors to achieve net-negative emissions in the second half of the 
century – more than 6 GtCO 2 yr–1 is captured and stored in 2100 (this 
represents roughly 60% of 2018 direct CO 2 emissions of the sector).
11.4.2.2 In-depth Discussion and ‘Reality’ Check of Pathways 
From Specific Sector Scenarios
Since AR5 a number of studies providing a high technological level 
of detail for the industry sector have been released which describe 
how the industry sector can significantly reduce its GHG emissions 
until the middle of the century. Many of these studies try to 
specifically reflect the particular industry sector characteristics and 
barriers that hinder industry to follow an optimal transformation 
pathway. They vary in respect to different characteristics. In respect 
to their geographical scope, some studies analyse the prospects 
for industry sector decarbonisation on a global level (IEA 2017a; 
Energy Transitions Commission 2018; Grubler et al. 2018; IEA 2020a, 
2019b, 2020c; Tchung-Ming et al. 2018); regional level, for example, 
European Commission (2018) and Material Economics (2019); or 
country level – studies for China, from where most industry-related 
emissions come (e.g.,  Zhou et al. 2019).23 In regard to sectoral 
scope, some studies include the entire industry sector, while others 
focus on selected GHG emission intensive sectors, such as steel, 
chemicals and/or concrete. Most of the scenarios focus solely on 
CO2 emissions, that is non-CO 2 emissions of the industrial sector 
are neglected.24
Industry sector mitigation studies also differ in regard to whether 
they develop coherent scenarios or whether they focus on discussing 
and analysing selected key mitigation strategies, without deriving full 
energy and emission scenarios. Coherent scenarios are developed 
in IEA (2017); Energy Transitions Commission (2018); Grubler et al. 
(2018); Tchung-Ming et al. (2018); IEA (2019b, 2020a,c); IEA (2021a); 
and IRENA (2021) on the global level, and in Climact (2018); 
European Commission (2018); and Material Economics (2019) on the 
European level. Recent literature analysing selected key mitigation 
strategies, for example IEA (2019b) and Material Economics (2019) 
has focused either exclusively or to a large extent on analysing the 
potential of materials efficiency and circular economy measures to 
reduce the need for primary raw materials relative to a  business-
as-usual development. The IEA (2021a, 2020a) also provides deep 
insights in  to single mitigation strategies for the industry sector, 
particularly the role of CCS.  The following discussion mainly 

et al. 2018) and a  few which have investigated the decarbonisation prospects of individual industrial clusters (Schneider 2019), but these types of studies are not 
discussed here.

and include N 2O emissions (e.g., from nitric and adipic acid production), CH 4 emissions (e.g., from chemical production and iron and steel production) and various F-gases 
(such as perfluorocarbons from primary aluminium production and semiconductor manufacturing) (USEPA and ICF 2012; Gambhir et al. 2017). Mitigation options for these 
non-CO 2 emissions are discussed in Gambhir et al. (2017).

If CO 2 emissions were to fall below net zero after 2070, then this would increase the possibility of reaching 1.5°C by the end of the century (IEA 2020c).concentrates on scenarios from the IEA. It has to be acknowledged 
that they only represent a small segment of the huge scenario family 
(see the scenario database in Chapter 3), but this approach enables 
to show the chronological evolution of scenarios coming from the 
same institution, using the same modelling approach (which allows 
a  technology-rich analytical backcasting approach), but reflect 
additional requests that emerge over time (Table 11.5). In the 2DS 
scenario from the ‘Energy Technology Perspectives (ETP)’ study (IEA 
2017), which intends to describe in great technological detail how 
the global energy system could transform by 2060 so as to be in line 
with limiting global warming to below 2°C, total CO 2 emissions are 
74% lower in 2060 than in 2014, while only 39% lower in the industry 
sector. The Beyond 2°C Scenario (B2DS) of the same study intends 
to show how far known clean energy technologies (including those 
that lead to negative emissions) could go if pushed to their practical 
limits, allowing the future temperature increase to be limited to ‘well 
below’ 2°C and lowering total CO 2 emissions by 100% by 2060 and 
by 75% relative to 2014 in the industry sector.
Technologies penetration assumed in the CTS scenario by 2060 allows 
for an industrial emission cut of 45% from 2017 levels and a 50% 
cut against projected 2060 emissions in the Reference Technology 
Scenario (RTS) from the same study (IEA 2019b), similar to IEA’s 
2DS scenario. Energy efficiency improvements and deployment 
of BATs contribute 46% to cumulative emission reduction in 
2018–2060, while fuel switching  (15%), material efficiency (19%) 
and deployment of innovative processes (20%) provide the rest. 
IEA (2020a,c) which continues the Energy Technology Perspectives 
series include the new Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) 
to describe a  trajectory for emissions consistent with reaching 
global ‘net zero’ CO 2 emissions by around 2070.25 In 2070 the net 
zero balance is reached through a compensation of the remaining 
CO2 emissions (fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes 
still lead to around 3 GtCO 2) by a combination of BECCS and to 
a lesser degree direct air capture and storage. In IEA (2020c) the 
Faster Innovation Case (FIC) shows a possibility to reach a net zero 
emissions level globally already in 2050, assuming that technology 
development and market penetration can be significantly 
accelerated. Innovation plays a major role in this scenario as almost 
half of all the additional emissions reductions in 2050 relative to 
the reference case would be from technologies that are in an early 
stage of development and have not yet reached the market today 
(IEA 2020c). The most ambitious IEA scenario NZE2050 (IEA 2021a) 
describes a pathway reaching net zero emissions at system level by 
2050. With 0.52 GtCO 2 industry-related CO 2 emissions (including 
process emissions) it ends up 94% below 2018 levels in 2050. 
Remaining emissions in the industry sector have to be compensated 
by negative emissions (e.g., via DAC).
Chapter 11 Industry11
Two studies complement the discussion of the IEA scenarios and 
are related to the IEA database.26 The ETC Supply Side scenario 
builds on the ETP 2017 study, investigating additional emission 
reduction potentials in the emissions-intensive sectors such as 
heavy industry and heavy-duty transport so as to be able to reach 
net zero emissions by the middle of the century. The LED scenario 
(Grubler et al. 2018) also builds on the ETP 2017 study, but focuses 
on the possible potential of very far-reaching efforts to reduce 
future material demand.

these studies’ energy and emission base year data on the industry sector deviates considerably from the other three studies included in the comparison, which all use IEA 
data. Furthermore, unlike the other studies, Tchung-Ming et al. (2018) do not provide detailed information on the steel, chemicals and concrete subsectors. Not included 
here but worth mentioning are many other sector-specific studies, for example Napp et al. (2019, 2014), which consider more technologically advanced decarbonisation 
routes for the sector.A comparison of the different mitigation scenarios shows that they 
depend on how individual mitigation strategies in the industry sector 
(Figure 11.13) are assessed. The use of CCS, for example, is in many 
scenarios assessed as very important, while other scenarios indicate 
that ambitious mitigation levels can be achieved without CCS in the 
industry sector. CCS plays a major role in the B2DS scenario (3.2 GtCO 2 
in 2050), the ETC Supply Side scenario (5.4 GtCO 2 in 2050) and the 
IEA (2020a, 2021a) scenarios (e.g., 2.8 Gt CO 2 in NZE2050 in 2050, 
roughly one half of the captured CO 2 is related to cement production), Table 11.4 | Perspectives on industrial sector mitigation potential (comparison of different IEA scenarios).

Industry  Chapter 1111while it is explicitly excluded in the LED scenario. In the latter scenario, 
on the other hand, considerable emission reductions are assumed to 
be achieved by far-reaching reductions in material demand relative 
to a baseline development. In other words, the analysed scenarios 
also suggest that to reach very strong emission reductions from the 
industry sector either CCS needs to be deployed to a great extent or 
considerable material demand reductions will need to be realised. 
Such demand reductions only play a minor role in the 2DS scenario 
and no role in the ETC Supply Side scenario. The SDS described in IEA 
(2020a) provides a pathway where both CCS and material efficiency 
contribute significantly. In SDS material efficiency is a relevant factor 
in several parts of industry, explicitly steel, cement, and chemicals. 
Combining the different material efficiency options including 
a substantial part lifetime extension (particularly of buildings) leads 
to 29% less steel production by 2070, 26% less cement production, 
and 25% less chemicals production respectively in comparison to 
the reference line used in the study (Stated Policy Scenario: STEPS). 
Sector- or subsector-specific analysis supports the growing role of 
material efficiency. For the global chemical and petrochemical sector, 
Saygin and Gielen (2021) point out that circular economy (including 
recycling) has to cover 16% of the necessary reduction that is needed 
for the implementation of a 1.5°C scenario.
In all scenarios, the relevance of biomass and electricity in industrial 
final energy demand increases, especially in the more ambitious 
scenarios NZE2050, SDS, ETC Supply Side and LED.  While in all 
scenarios, electrification becomes more and more important, hydrogen 
or hydrogen-derived fuels, on the other hand, do not contribute to 
industrial final energy demand by the middle of the century in 2DS 
and B2DS, while LED (1% final energy share in 2050) and particularly 
ETC Supply Side (25% final energy share in 2050) consider hydrogen 
or hydrogen-derived fuels as a significant option. In the updated IEA 
scenarios hydrogen and hydrogen-based fuels already play a  more 
important role. In the SDS share in industry, final energy is around 
10% (IEA 2020a) and in the Faster Innovation Case around 12% (IEA 
2020c) in 2050. In the latter case this is based on the assumption 
that by 2050 on average each year 22 hydrogen-based steel plants 
come into operation (IEA 2020c). In SDS around 60% of the hydrogen 
is produced on-site via water electrolysis while the remaining 40% is 
generated in fossil fuel plants (methane reforming) coupled with CCS 
facilities. In the NZE2050 scenario biomass/biomethane (13%/3%), 
hydrogen (3%), natural gas with CCUS (4%), and coal with CCUS 
(4%) are responsible for 27% of the final energy demand of the 
sector. This is much more than in 2018, starting here from roughly 6% 
(only biomass). Direct use of electricity still plays a bigger role in the 
analysis, as share of electricity increases in NZE2050 from 22% in 2018 
to 28% in 2030 and 46% in 2050 (with 15% a part of the electricity 
is used to produce hydrogen). This is reflecting the effect that since 
the publication of older IEA reports more direct electric applications 
for the sector become available. In NZE2050 approximately 25% of 
total heat used in the sector is electrified directly with heat pumps or 
indirectly with synthetic fuels already by 2030.
For B2DS it is assumed that most of the available abatement options 
in the industry sector are pushed to their feasible limits. That leads to 
cumulative direct CO 2 emissions reductions compared to 2DS which 
come from: energy efficiency improvements and BAT deployment (42%), innovative processes and CCS (37%), switching to lower 
carbon fuels and feedstocks (13%), and material efficiency strategies 
in manufacturing processes (8%). Energy efficiency improvements 
are particularly important in the first time period.
The IEA World Energy Outlook indicates energy efficiency improvement 
in the 2020 to 2030 period as a major basis to switch from STEPS 
(stated policies) to the SDS (net zero emissions by 2070) pathway 
(IEA 2020i, 2021c). For many energy-intensive industries annual 
efficiency gains have to be almost doubled (e.g., from 0.6% yr–1 to 
1.0% yr–1 for cement production) to contribute sufficiently to the 
overall goal. If net zero CO 2 emissions should be achieved already 
by 2050 as pursued in the NZE2050 scenario (IEA 2020i, 2021c) 
further accelerating energy efficiency improvements are necessary 
(e.g., for cement, annual efficiency gains of 1.75%), leading to the 
effect that in 2030 many processes are implemented closely to their 
technological limits. In total, sector final energy demand can be 
held nearly constant at 2018 levels until 2050 and decoupled from 
product demand growth.
The comparative analysis leads to the point that the relevance of 
individual mitigation strategies in different scenarios depends not 
only on a  scenario’s level of ambition. Instead, implicit or explicit 
assumptions about: (i) the costs associated with each strategy, 
(ii) future technological progress and availability of individual 
technologies, and (iii) the future public or political acceptance of 
individual strategies are likely to be main reasons for the observed 
differences between the analysed scenarios. For many energy-
intensive products, technologies capable of deep emission cuts are 
already available. Their application is subject to different economic 
and resources constraints (incremental investment needs, product 
prices escalation, requirements for escalation of new low-carbon 
power generation). To fully exploit potential availability of carbon-free 
energy sources (e.g., electricity or hydrogen and related derivates) is 
a fundamental prerequisite and marks the strong interdependencies 
between the industry and the energy sector.
Assessment of the scenario literature allows to conclude that under 
specific conditions strong CO 2-emission reductions in the industry 
sector by 2050–2070 and even net-zero-emission pathways are 
possible. However, there is no consensus on the most plausible or 
most desirable mix of key mitigation strategies to be pursued. In 
addition it has to be stressed that suitable pathways are very country-
specific and depend on the economic structure, resource potentials, 
technological competences, and political preferences and processes 
of the country or region in question (Bataille 2020a).
There is a  consensus among the scenarios that a  significant shift 
is needed from a  transition process in the past mainly based on 
marginal (incremental) changes (with a  strong focus on energy 
efficiency efforts) to one based on transformational change. To limit 
the barriers that are associated with transformational change, besides 
overcoming the valley of death for technologies or processes with 
breakthrough character, it is required to carefully identify structural 
change processes which are connected with substantial changes of 
the existing system (including the whole process chain). This has to 
be done at an early stage and has to be linked with considerations 
Chapter 11 Industry11about preparatory measures which are able to flank the changes 
and to foster the establishment of new structures (Section  11.6). 
The right sequencing of the various mitigation options and building 
appropriate bridges between the different strategies are important. 
Rissman et al. (2020) proposes three phases of technologies 
deployment for the industry sector: (i) energy/material efficiency 
improvement (mainly incremental) and electrification in combination 
with demonstration projects for new technologies potentially 
important in subsequent phases (2020–2035), (ii) structural shifts 
based on technologies which reach maturity in phase (i) such as CCS 
and alternative materials (2035–2050), (iii) widespread deployment 
for technologies that are nascent today like molten oxide electrolysis-
based steel-making. There are no strong boundaries between the 
different phases and all phases have to be accompanied by effective 
policies like R&D programmes and market pull incentives.
Taking the steel sector as an illustrative example, sector-specific 
scenarios examining the possibility to reach GHG reduction beyond 
80% (CAT 2020; Bataille et al. 2021b; IEA 2021a; Vogl et al. 2021b) 
indicate that robust measures comprise direct reduction of iron (DRI) 
with hydrogen in combination with efforts to further close the loops 
and increase availability of scrap metal (reducing the demand for 
primary steel). As hydrogen-based DRI might not be a fully mature 
technology before 2030 (depending on further developments of 
the policy framework and technological progress), risk of path 
dependencies has to be taken into consideration when reinvestments 
in existing production capacities will be required in the coming years. 
For existing plants, implementation of energy efficiency measures 
(e.g.,  utilisation of waste heat, improvement of high-temperature 
pumps) could build a  bridge for further mitigation measures but 
have only limited unexhausted potential. As many GHG mitigation 
measures are associated with high investment costs and missing 
operating experience, a  step-by-step implementing process might 
be an appropriate strategy to avoid investment leakage (given the 

as not to miss opportunities) and to gain experience. In the case 
of steel, companies can start with the integration of a natural gas-
based direct reduced iron furnace feeding the reduced iron to an 
existing blast furnace, blending and later replacing the natural gas by 
hydrogen in a second stage, and later transitioning to a full hydrogen 
DRI EAF or molten oxide electrolysis EAF , all without disturbing the 
local upstream and downstream supply chains.
It is worth mentioning the flexibility of implementing transformational 
changes not the least depends on the age profile and projected 
longevity of existing capital stock, especially the willingness to accept 
the intentional or market-based stranding of high GHG intensity 
investments. This is a relevant aspect in all producing countries, but 
particularly in those countries with a rather young industry structure 
(i.e., comparative low age of existing facilities on average). Tong et al. 
(2019) suggest that in China, using the survival rate as a proxy, less 
than 10% of existing cement or steel production facilities will reach 
their end of operation time by 2050. Vogl et al. (2021b) argue that 
the mean blast furnace campaign is considerably shorter than used 
in Tong et al.(2019), at only 17 years between furnace relining, which 
suggests there is more room for retrofitting with clean steel major 
process technologies than generally assumed. Bataille et al. (2021b) 
found if very low carbon intensity processes were mandatory starting 
in 2025, given the lifetimes of existing facilities, major steel process 
lifetimes of up to 27 years would still make a full retrofit cycle with 
low-carbon processes possible.
In general, early adoption of new technologies plays a major role. 
Considering the long operation time (lifetime) of industrial facilities 
(e.g., steel mills and cement kilns) early adoption of new technologies 
is needed to avoid lock-in. For the SDS 2020 scenario, the IEA (2020h) 
calculated the potential cumulative reduction of CO 2 emissions from 
the steel, cement and chemicals sector to be around 57 GtCO 2 if

EE – energy efficiency; ME – material efficiency; Circularity – material flows (clinker substituted by coal fly ash, blast furnace slag or other by-products and 
waste, steel scrap, plastic recycling, etc.); FeedCI – feedstock carbon intensity (hydrogen, biomass, novel cement, natural clinker substitutes); FSW+El – fuel 
switch and processes electrification with low-carbon electricity.  Ranges for mitigation options are shown based on bottom-up studies for grouped technologies packages, 
not for single technologies. In circles, contribution to mitigation from technologies based on their readiness are shown for 2050 (2040) and 2070. Direct emissions include fuel 
combustion and process emissions. Indirect emissions include emissions attributed to consumed electricity and purchased heat. For basic chemicals only methanol, ammonia and 
high-value chemicals are considered. The total for industry doesn’t include emissions from waste. Base values for 2020 for direct and indirect emissions were calculated using 2019 
GHG emission data (Crippa et al. 2021) and data for materials production from World Steel Association (2020a) and IEA (2021d). Negative mitigation costs for some options like 
Circularity are not reflected. Data from sources: Pauliuk et al. (2013a); Fawkes et al. (2016); WBCSD (2016); Bazzanella and Ausfelder (2017); IEA (2018a, 2019b,g,h, 2020a,c, 
2021a); Lehne and Preston (2018); Scrivener et al. (2018); EUROFER (2019); Friedmann et al. (2019); Material Economics (2019); Sandalow et al. (2019); CAT (2020); CEMBUREAU 
(2020); Gielen et al. (2020); Habert et al. (2020); World Steel Association (2020b); Bataille (2020a); GCCA (2021a); and Saygin and Gielen (2021).
Chapter 11 Industry11production technology is changed at its first mandatory retrofit, 
typically 25 years, rather than at 40 years (typical retrofitted lifetime) 
(Figure 11.14). Net zero pathways require that the new facilities 
are based on zero- or near-zero emissions technologies from 2030 
onwards (IEA 2021c).
Another important finding is that material efficiency and demand 
management are still not well represented in the scenario literature. 
Besides IEA (2020a) two of the few exceptions are Material 
Economics (2019) for the EU and Zhou et al. (2019) for China. Zhou 
et al. (2019) describe a consistent mitigation pathway (Reinventing 
Fire scenario) for China where in 2050 CO 2 emissions are at a level 
42% below 2010 emissions. Around 13% of the reduction is related 
to less material demand, mainly based on extension of building and 
infrastructure lifetime, as well as reduction of material losses in 
the production process and application of higher quality materials 
particularly high-quality cement (Zhou et al. 2019). For buildings 
and cars, Pauliuk et al. (2021) analysed the potential role of material 
efficiency and demand management strategies on material demand 
to be covered by the industry sector.
For the four subsectors in industry with high emissions, Table 11.5 
shows results from Material Economics (2019) for the EU.  The 
combination of circularity, material and energy efficiency, fossil and 
waste fuels mix, electrification, hydrogen, CCS and biomass use 
varies from scenario to scenario with none of these options ignored, 
but trade-offs are required.
The analysis of net zero emission pathways requires significantly 
higher investments compared to business as usual (BAU): 25–65% for 
steel, 6–26% for ammonia, 22–49% for cement, and with 122–199% 
the highest number for plastics (Material Economics 2019).
While sector-specific cost analyses  are rare in general, there are 
scenarios indicating that pathways to net zero CO 2 emissions in the 
emissions-intensive sectors can be realised with limited additional 
costs. According to the Energy Transitions Commission (2018), deep 
decarbonisation from four major industry subsectors (plastics, steel, 
aluminium and cement) is achievable on a global level with cumulative 
incremental capital investments (2015–2050) limited to about 0.1% 
of aggregate GDP over that period. UKCCC (2019a) assesses that 
total incremental costs (compared to a theoretical scenario with no 
climate change policy action at all) for cutting industrial emissions 
by 90% by 2050 is 0.2% of expected 2050  UK  GDP (UKCCC 
2019a). The additional investment is 0.2% of gross fixed capital 
formation (Material Economics 2019). The IEA (2020a) indicates the 
required annual incremental global investment in heavy industry is 
approximately 40 billion 2019USD yr–1 moving from STEPS to the 
SDS scenario (2020–2040), rising to USD55 billion yr–1 (2040–2070), 
effectively 0.05–0.07% of global annual GDP today.
Finally, a  new literature is emerging, based on the new sectoral 
electrification, hydrogen- and CCS- based technologies listed in 
previous sections, considering the possibility of rearranging standard 
supply and process chains using regional and international trade 
in intermediate materials like primary iron, clinker and chemical 
feedstocks, to reduce global emissions by moving production of these materials to regions with large and inexpensive renewable energy 
potential or CCS geology (Bataille 2020a; Gielen et al. 2020; Bataille 
et al. 2021a; Saygin and Gielen 2021).
In a  sequence of sectoral- and industry-wide figures above 
(Figure 11.13), it is shown – starting in the present on the left and 
moving through 2050 to 2070 on the right, how much separate 
mitigation strategies can contribute and how they are integrated 
in the literature to reach near-zero emissions. For cement, steel 
and primary chemicals GHG intensities are presented, and for 
all industry absolute GHG emissions are displayed. Effects of the 
following mitigation strategies are reflected: energy efficiency, 
material efficiency, circularity/recycling, feedstock carbon intensity, 
fuel switching, CCU and CCS. Contributions of technologies split by 
their readiness for 2050 and 2070 are provided along with ranges of 
mitigation costs for achieving near-zero emissions for each strategy, 
accompanied by ranges of associated basic materials cost escalations 
and driven by these final products’ prices increments.
11.4.3 Cross-sectoral Interactions and Societal 
Pressure on Industry
Mitigation involves greater integration and coupling between sectors. 
This is widely recognised, for example, in the case of electrification of 
transport (Sections 6.6.2 and 10.3.1), but it has been less explored for 
industrial decarbonisation. Industry is a  complex web of subsectors and 
intersectoral interaction and dependence, with associated mitigation 
opportunities and co-benefits and costs (OECD 2019b; Mendez-Alva 
et al. 2021). Implementation of the mitigation options assessed in 
Section 11.3 will result in new sectoral couplings, value chains, and 
business models but also in the phasing out of old ones. Notably, 
electrification in industry, hydrogen and sourcing of non-fossil carbon 
involves profound changes to how industry interacts with electricity 
systems and how industrial subsectors interact. For example, the 
chemicals and forestry industries will become much more coupled if 
various forms of biogenic carbon become an important feedstock for 
plastics (Figure 11.10). Clinker substitution with blast furnace slag 
in the cement industry is a  well-established way of reducing CO 2 
emissions (Fechner and Kray 2012), but this slag will no longer be 
available if blast furnaces are phased out. Furthermore, additional 
material demand resulting from mitigation in other sectors, as well as 
adaptation and the importance of material efficiency improvements, 
are issues that have attracted increasing attention since AR5 (IEA 
2019b; Bleischwitz 2020; Hertwich et al. 2020). How future material 
will be affected under different climate scenarios is underexplored 
and typically not accounted for in modelling (Bataille et al. 2021a).
Using industrial waste heat for space heating, via district heating, 
is an established practice that still has a large potential with large 
quantities of low-grade heat being wasted (Fang et al. 2015). For 
Denmark it is estimated that 5.1% of district heating demand could 
be met with waste heat (Bühler et al. 2017) and for four towns 
studied in Austria 3–35% of total heat demand could be met (Karner 
et al. 2016). A  European study shows that temporal heat demand 
flexibility could allow for up to 100% utilisation of excess heat 
from industry (Karner et al. 2018). A study of a Swedish chemicals 
Industry  Chapter 1111complex estimated that 30–50% of excess heat generated on-
site could be recovered with payback periods below three years 
(Eriksson et al. 2018).
A European study found that most of the industrial symbiosis or 
clustering synergies today are in the chemicals sector with shared 
streams of energy, water, and carbon dioxide (Mendez-Alva et al. 
2021). For future mitigation, the UKCCC (2019b) finds that industrial 
clustering may be essential for achieving the necessary efficiencies 
of scale and to build the infrastructure needed for industrial 
electrification; carbon capture, transport and disposal; hydrogen 
production and storage;  heat cascading between industries and to 
other potential heat users (e.g., residential and commercial buildings).
With increasing shares of renewable electricity production there is 
a growing interest in industrial demand response, storage and hybrid 
solutions with on-site PV and combined heat and power (CHP)  (Shoreh 
et al. 2016; Scheubel et al. 2017; Schriever and Halstrup 2018). With 
future industrial electrification, and in particular with hydrogen used 
as reduction agent in iron-making or as feedstock in the chemicals 
industry, the level of interaction between industry and power systems 
becomes very high. Large amounts of coking coal, or oil and gas as 
petrochemical energy and feedstock, are then replaced by electricity. 
For example, Meys et al. (2021) estimates a staggering future electricity 
demand of 10,000 TWh in a scenario for a net zero emissions plastics 
production of 1100 Mt in 2050 (see Section 11.3.5 for other estimates 
of electricity demand). Much of this electricity is used to produce 
hydrogen to allow for CCU and this provides a  very large potential 
flexible demand if electrolysers are combined with hydrogen storage. 
Vogl et al. (2018) describe how hydrogen DRI and EAF steel plants can 
be highly flexible in their electricity demand by storing hydrogen or hot-
briquetted iron and increasing the share of scrap in EAF . The IEA (2019f) 
Future of Hydrogen report suggests that hydrogen production and 
storage networks could be in locations with already existing hydrogen 
production and storage, for example, chemical industries, and that 
these could be ideal for system load balancing and demand response, 
and in the case of district heating systems – for heat cascading.
The climate awareness that investors, shareholders, and customers 
demand from companies has been increasing steadily. It is reflected 
in the growing number of environmental management, carbon 
footprint accounting, benchmarking and reporting schemes (e.g., the 
Carbon Disclosure Project, Task Force on Climate-Related Financial 
Disclosures, Environmental Product Declarations, and others, 
e.g.,  Qian et al. 2018) requiring companies to disclose both direct 
and indirect GHG emissions, and creating explicit (for regulatory 
schemes) as well as implicit GHG liabilities. This requires harmonised 
and widely accepted methods for environmental and carbon footprint 
accounting (Bashmakov et al. 2021b). From an investor perspective 
there are both physical risks (e.g., potential damages from climate 
change to business) and transition risks (e.g., premature devaluation 
of assets driven by new policies and technologies deployment and 
changes in public and private consumer preferences (NGFS 2019a)). 
Accompanied by reputational risks this leads to increased attention 
to Sustainable and Responsible Investment (SRI) principles and 
increased demands from investors, consumers and governments on 
climate and sustainability reporting and disclosure (NGFS 2019b). For example, Japan’s Keidanren promotes a  scheme by different 
industries to reduce GHG through the global value chain, including 
material procurement, product-use stages, and disposal, regardless 
of geographical origin, with provided quantitative visualisation 
(Keidanren (Japan Business Federation) 2018). The EU adopted 
a non-financial disclosure directive in 2014 (Kinderman 2020) and 
a Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance in 2019 (Section 15.6.1).
11.4.4 Links to Climate Change and Adaptation
Sectors that are particularly vulnerable to climate change include 
agriculture, forestry, fisheries and aquaculture, and their downstream 
processing industries (Bezner et al. 2021). Many of the energy-
intensive industries are located based on access to fresh water 
(e.g., pulp and paper) or sea transport (e.g., petrochemicals). Risks 
of major concern for industry include disrupted supply chains and 
energy supplies due to extreme weather events, as well as risks 
associated with droughts, floods with dirty water, sea level rise and 
storm surges (Dodman et al. 2021). Adaptation measures may in 
turn affect the demand for basic materials (e.g., steel and cement), 
for example, increased demand to build sea walls and protect 
infrastructure, but we have not found any estimates of the potential 
demand. Increased heat stress is unsafe for outdoor labourers and 
can reduce worker productivity, for example, in outdoor construction, 
resource extraction and waste handling (Ranasinghe et al. 2021).
11.5 Industrial Infrastructure, Policy, and 
Sustainable Development Goal Contexts
11.5.1 Existing Industry Infrastructures
Countries are at different stages of different economic development 
paths. Some are already industrialised, while developing and 
emerging economies are on earlier take-off stages or accelerated 
growth stages and have yet to build the basic infrastructure needed 
to allow for basic mobility, housing, sanitation, and other services 
(Section 11.2.3). The available in-use stock of material per capita and 
in each country therefore differs significantly, and transition pathways 
will require a different mix of strategies, depending on each country’s 
material demand to build, maintain, and operate stock of long-lived 
assets. Industrialised economies have much greater opportunities 
for reusing and recycling materials, while emerging economies have 
greater opportunities to avoid carbon lock-in. The IEA projected that 
more than 90% of the additional 2050 production of key materials 
will originate in non-OECD countries (IEA 2017). As incomes rise in 
emerging economies, the industry sector will grow in tandem to meet 
the increased demand for the manufactured goods and raw materials 
essential for infrastructure development. The energy and feedstocks 
needed to support this growth are likely to constitute a large portion 
of the increase in the emerging economies’ GHG emissions in the 
future unless new low-carbon pathways are identified and promoted.
Emissions are typically categorised by the territory, subsector or 
group of technologies from which they emanate. An alternative 
subdivision is that between existing sources that will continue to 
Chapter 11 Industry11generate emissions in the future, and those that are yet to be built 
(Erickson et al. 2015). The rate of emissions from existing assets will 
eventually tend to zero, but in a timeframe that is relevant to existing 
climate and energy goals, the cumulative contribution to emissions 
from existing infrastructure and equipment is likely to be substantial. 
Aside from the magnitude of the contribution, the distinction between 
emissions from existing and forthcoming assets is instructive because 
of the difference in approach to mitigation that may be necessary or 
desirable in each instance to avoid getting locked into decades of 
highly carbon-intensive operations (Lecocq and Shalizi 2014).
Details of the methodologies to assess ‘carbon lock-in’ or ‘committed 
emissions’ differ across studies but the core components of the 
approaches adopted are common to each: an account of the existing 
level of emissions for the scope being assessed is established; this 
level is projected forward with a  stylised decay function that is 
informed by assessments of the current age and typical lifetimes of 
the underlying assets. From this, a cumulative emissions estimate is  
calculated. The future emissions intensity of the operated assets 
is  usually assumed to remain constant, implying that nothing is 
done to retrofit with mitigating technologies (e.g., carbon capture) 
or alter the way in which the plant is operated (e.g., switching to 
an alternative fuel or feedstock). While the quantities of emissions 
derived are often referred to as ‘committed’ or ‘locked-in’, their 
occurrence is of course dependent on a suite of economic, technology 
and policy developments that are highly uncertain.
Data on the current age profile and typical lifetimes of emissions-
intensive industrial equipment are difficult to procure and verify and 
most of the studies conducted in this area contain little detail on 
the global industrial sector. Two recent studies are exceptions, both 
of which cover the global energy system, but contain detailed and 
novel analysis on the industrial sector (Tong et al. 2019; IEA 2020a). 
Tong et al. (2019) use unit-level data from China’s Ministry of Ecology 
and Environment to obtain a more robust estimate of the age profile 
of existing capacity in the cement and iron and steel sectors in the 
country. The IEA (2020a) uses proprietary global capacity datasets for 
the iron and steel, cement and chemicals sectors, and historic energy 
consumption data for the remaining industry sectors as a proxy for 
the rate of historic capacity build-up.Both studies come to similar estimates on the average age of cement 
plants and blast furnaces in China of around 10–12 years old, which 
are the figures for which they have overlapping coverage. Both studies 
also use the same assumption of the typical lifetime of assets in these 
sectors of 40 years, whereas the IEA (2020a) study uses 30 years for 
chemical sector assets and 25 years for other industrial sectors. The 
studies come to differing estimates of cumulative emissions by 2050 
from the industry sector; 196 GtCO 2 in the IEA (2020a) study, and 

to a differing scope of emissions, with the IEA (2020a) study including 
industrial process emissions (which for the cement sector in particular 
are substantial) in addition to the energy-related emissions quantities 
accounted for in the Tong et al. (2019) study. After correcting for this 
difference in scope, the emissions estimates compare favourably.
The IEA (2020a) study provides supplementary analysis for the industry 
sector, examining the impact of considering investment cycles alongside 
the typical lifetimes assumed in its core analysis of emissions from 
existing industrial assets. For three heavy industry sectors – iron and 
steel, cement, and chemicals – the decay function applied to emissions 
from existing assets is re-simulated using a 25-year investment cycle 
assumption (Figure  11.14). This is 15 years shorter than the typical 
lifetimes assumed for assets in the iron and steel and cement sectors, 
and five years shorter than that considered for the chemical sector. 
The shorter timeframe for the investment cycle is a simplified way of 
representing the intermediate investments that are made to extend the 
life of a plant, such as the re-lining of a blast furnace, which can occur 
multiple times during the lifetime of an installation. These investments 
can often be similar in magnitude to that of replacing the installation, 
and they represent key points for intervention to reduce emissions. 
The findings of this supplementary analysis are that around 40%, or 

are available to replace this capacity, or units are retired, retrofitted 
or refurbished in a  way that significantly mitigates emissions 
(e.g., retrofitting carbon capture, or fuel or process switching to utilise 
bioenergy or low-carbon hydrogen).
As this review was being finalised several papers were released that 
somewhat contradict the Tong et al. (2010) results (Bataille et al. 2021b; 
Vogl et al. 2021b). Broadly speaking, these papers argue that while 
Figure 11.14 | CO 2 emissions from existing heavy industrial assets in the NZE.  Source: International Energy Agency (2021), Net Zero by 2050, IEA, Paris.
Industry  Chapter 1111high-emitting facilities may last for a  long time, be difficult to shut 
down early, and are inherent to local boarder supply chains, individual 
major processes that are currently highly GHG intense, such as blast 
furnaces and basic oxygen smelters, could be retired and replaced 
during major retrofits on much shorter time cycles of 15 to 25 years.
The cost of retrofitting or retiring a plant before the end of its lifetime 
depends on plant-specific conditions as well as a range of economic, 
technology and policy developments. For industrial decarbonisation 
it may be a  greater challenge to accelerate the development and 
deployment of zero-emission technologies and systems than to 
handle the economic costs of retiring existing assets before end of 
life. The ‘lock-in’ also goes beyond the lifetime of key process units, 
such as blast furnaces and crackers, since they are typically part 
of large integrated plants or clusters with industrial symbiosis, as 
well as infrastructures with feedstock storage, ports, and pipelines. 
Individual industrial plants are often just a small part of a complex 
network of many facilities in an industrial supply chain. In that sense, 
current assessments of ‘carbon lock-in’ rely on simplifications due to 
the high the complexity of industry.
Conditions are also subsector and context specific in terms of 
mitigation options, industry structures, markets, value chains and 
geographical location. For example, the hydrogen steel-making joint 
venture in Sweden involves three different companies headquartered 
in Sweden (in mining, electricity and steel-making, respectively), two 
of which are state-owned, with a shared vision and access to iron ore, 
fossil-free electricity and high-end steel markets (Kushnir et al. 2020). 
In contrast, chemical clusters may consist of several organisations 
that are subsidiaries to large multinational corporations with 
headquarters across the world, that also compete in different 
markets. Even in the presence of a local vision for sustainability this 
makes it difficult to engage in formalised collaboration or get support 
from headquarters (Bauer and Fuenfschilling 2019).
Furthermore, it is relevant to consider also institutional and behavioural 
lock-in (Seto et al. 2016). On one side, existing high-emitting 
practices may be favoured through formal and informal institutions 
(e.g., regulations and social norms or expectations, respectively), for 
example, around building construction and food packaging. On the 
other side, mitigation options may face corresponding institutional 
barriers. Examples include how cars are conventionally scrapped 
(i.e.,  crushed, leading to copper contamination of steel) rather 
than being dismantled, or slow permitting procedures for new 
infrastructure and industrial installations for reducing emissions.
11.5.2 Current Industrial and Broader Policy Context
The basic motivation for industrial policy historically has been 
economic development and wealth creation. Industrial policy can be 
progressive and promote new developments or be protective to help 
infant or declining industries. It may also involve the phase-out of 
industries, including efforts to retrain workers and create new jobs. 
Industrial policy is not one policy intervention but rather the combined 
effects of many policy instruments that are coordinated towards an 
industrial goal. Industrial policies can be classified as being either vertical or horizontal depending on whether singular sectors or 
technologies are targeted (e.g., through R&D, tariffs and subsidies) 
or the whole economy (e.g., education, infrastructure, and general 
tax policies). The horizontal policies are not always thought of as 
industrial policy, although taking a  broad view, including policy 
coordination and institution building, is important for industrial 
policy to be effective (see e.g., Andreoni and Chang 2019).
In the past ten years there has been increasing interest and attention 
to industrial policy. One driver is the desire to retain industry or 
re-industrialise in regions within Europe and North America where 
industry has a long record of declining shares of GDP . The need for 
economic growth and poverty eradication is a key driver in developing 
countries. An important aspect is the need to meet the ‘dual challenge 
of creating wealth for a  growing population while staying within 
planetary boundaries’ (Altenburg and Assman 2017). The need for 
industrial policy that supports environmental goals and green growth 
has been analysed by Rodrik (2014); Aiginger (2014); Warwick (2013); 
and Busch et al. (2018). Similar ideas are taken up in OECD reports 
on green growth (OECD 2011) and system innovation (OECD 2015). 
However, these approaches to green industrial policy and innovation 
tend to focus on opportunities for manufacturing industries to 
develop through new markets for cleaner technologies. They rarely 
include explicit attention to the necessity of zero emissions and the 
profound changes in production, use and recycling of basic materials 
that this entails. This may also involve the phase-out or repurposing 
of industries that currently rely on fossil fuels and feedstock.
The policy implications of zero emissions for heavy industries are 
relatively unexplored, although some analyses in this direction 
are available (e.g., Åhman et al. 2017; Philibert 2017a; Wesseling 
et al. 2017; Bataille et al. 2018a; Wyns et al. 2019; Bataille 2020a; 
Fan and Friedmann 2021). For industry, there has been a long time 
focus on energy efficiency policies through voluntary and negotiated 
agreements, energy management and audit schemes, and various 
programmes targeting industry (Fischedick et al. 2014a). Since AR5, 
interest in circular economy policies has increased and they have 
become more prevalent across regions and countries, including 
the EU, China, USA., Japan and Brazil (e.g., McDowall et al. 2017; 
Ranta et al. 2018; Geng et al. 2019). For electrification and CCUS, 
efforts are nascent and mainly focused on technology development 
and demonstrations. Policies for demand reduction and materials 
efficiency are still relatively unexplored (e.g., Pollitt et al. 2020 and 
IEA 2019b). Since zero emissions in industry is a  new governance 
challenge it will be important to build awareness and institutional 
capacity in industrialised as well as developing countries.
In the context of climate change policy, it is fair to say that industry has 
so far been sheltered from the increasing costs that decarbonisation 
may entail. This is particularly true for the energy- and emissions-
intensive industries where cost increases and lost competitiveness 
may lead to carbon leakage (i.e., that industry relocates to regions 
with less stringent climate policies). Heavy industries typically pay no 
or very low energy taxes and where carbon pricing exists (e.g., in the 
European Trading Scheme) they are sheltered through free allocation 
of emission permits and potentially compensated for resulting 
electricity price increases. For example, Okereke and McDaniels 
Chapter 11 Industry11(2012) show how the European steel industry was successful in 
avoiding cost increases and how information asymmetry in the policy 
process was important for that purpose.
11.5.3 Co-benefits of Mitigation Strategies 
and Sustainable Development Goals
The deployment of climate change mitigation strategies is 
primarily influenced by its costs and potential, but also by other 
broader sustainable development factors such as the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs). Mitigation actions therefore are to 
be considered through the prism of impacts on achieving other 
economic, social  and  environmental goals. Those impacts are 
classified as co-benefits when they are positive or as risk when they 
are negative. Co-benefits can serve as additional drivers, while risks 
can inhibit the deployment of available mitigation options. Actions 
taken to mitigate climate change have direct and indirect interactions 
with SDGs, both positive (synergies) or negative (trade-offs) (Fuso 
Nerini et al. 2019).
Given the wide range of stakeholders involved in climate actions 
and their (often contradictory) interests and priorities, the nature of 
co-benefits and risk can affect decision-making processes and the 
behaviour of stakeholders (Labella et al. 2020). Co-benefits form an 
important driver supporting the adoption of mitigation strategies, 
yet are commonly overlooked in policymaking. Karlsson et al. (2020), 
based on a  review of 239 peer-reviewed articles concluded that 
diverse co-benefit categories, including air, soil and water quality, 
diet, physical activity, biodiversity, economic performance, and 
energy security, are prevalent in the literature.
11.5.3.1 Sustainable Development Goals Co-benefits Through 
Material Efficiency and Demand Reduction
Material efficiency, an important mitigation option (SDG 13, climate 
action) for heavy industries, is yet to be fully acknowledged and 
leveraged (Gonzalez Hernandez et al. 2018a; Sudmant et al. 2018; 
Dawkins et al. 2019). Material efficiency directly addresses SDG 

opportunities to reduce the pressures and impacts on environmental 
systems (SDG 6, clean water and sanitation) (Olivetti and Cullen 2018). 
Exploiting material efficiency usually requires new business models 
and provides potential co-benefits of increased employment and 
economic opportunities (SDG 8, decent work and economic growth).
Material efficiency also provides co-benefits through infrastructural 
development (SDG 9, industry, innovation and infrastructure) 
(Mathews et al. 2018) to support the wide range of potential 
material efficiency strategies including light-weighting, reusing, 
remanufacturing, recycling, diverting scrap, extending product 
lives, using products more intensely, improving process yields, and 
substituting materials (Allwood et al. 2011). Worrell et al. (2016) 
also emphasises how material efficiency improvements, in addition 
to limiting the impacts of climate change help deliver sustainable 
production and consumption co-benefits through environmental 
stewardship. Binder and Blankenberg (2017) and Dhandra (2019) show that sustainable consumption is positively related to life 
satisfaction and subjective well-being (SDG 3), and Guillen-Royo 
(2019) adds positive associations with happiness and life satisfaction.
The reduction in excessive consumption and demand for products 
and services generates a  reduction in post-consumption waste 
and so enhances clear water and sanitation (SDG 6) (Govindan 
2018; Minelgaitė and Liobikienė 2019), and reduces waste along 
product supply chains and lifecycles (SDG 12) (Genovese et al. 
2017; UNSD 2020). At the risk side there are possible reductions of 
employment, incomes, sales taxes from the material extraction 
and processing activities, considered as excessive for sustainable 
consumption (Thomas 2003).
11.5.3.2 Sustainable Development Goals Co-benefits 
From Circular Economy and Industrial Waste
While the circular economy concept first emerged in the context of 
waste avoidance, resource depletion, closed-loop recycling, etc., it 
has now evolved as a  tool for a  broader systemic national policy 
due to its potential wider benefits (Geng et al. 2013). It represents 
new circular business models that encourage design for reuse 
and to improve material recovery and recycling, and so represents 
a departure from the traditional linear production and consumption 
systems (with landfilling at the end), with a wide range of potential 
co-benefits to a wide range of SDGs (Guo et al. 2016; Genovese et al. 
2017; Schroeder et al. 2019; UNSD 2020).
Genovese et al. (2017) articulates the advantages from an 
environmental and responsible consumption and production point 
of view (SDG 12). Many studies have outlined new business models 
based on the circular economy that foster sustainable economic 
growth and the generation of new jobs (SDG 8) (Antikainen and 
Valkokari 2016), as well as global competitiveness and innovation 
in business and the industrial sector (Pieroni et al. 2019), such as its 
potential synergies with industry 4.0 (Garcia-Muiña et al. 2018).
Following a review of the literature, Schroeder et al. (2019) identified 
linkages between circular economy practices and SDGs based on 
a relationship scoring system, and highlighted that such SDGs as SDG 

SDG 8  (decent work and economic growth), SDG 12 (responsible 
consumption and production), and SDG 15 (life on land) all strongly 
benefit from circular economy practices. With the potential to impact 
on all stages of the value chain (micro, meso and macro level of 
the economy), circular economy has also been identified as a  key 
industrial strategy to managing waste across sectors.
Chatziaras et al. (2016) highlights the co-benefit to SDG 7 (affordable 
and clean energy) resulting from waste-derived fuel for the cement 
industry. Through the management of industrial waste using circular 
economy practices, studies such as Geng et al. (2012) and Bonato 
and Orsini (2017) have pointed out co-benefits to SDGs beyond 
clear environmental and economic benefits, highlighting how it 
also benefits SDG 3  and 11 through improved social relations 
between industrial sectors and local societies, and improved public 
environmental awareness and public health levels.
Industry  Chapter 111111.5.3.3 Sustainable Development Goals Co-benefits 
From Energy Efficiency
Beyond the very direct links between energy and climate change, 
reliable, clean, and affordable energy (SDG 7) presents a  cross-
cutting issue, central to all SDGs and fundamental to development, 
and energy efficiency enables its provision by reducing the direct 
supply and necessary infrastructure required. Energy efficiency 
improvements can be delivered through multiple technical options 
and tested policies, delivering energy and resource savings 
simultaneously with other socio-economic and environmental co-
benefits. At the macro level, this includes enhancement of energy 
security (SDG 16, peace, justice and strong institutions) delivered 
through clean low-carbon energy systems (Fankhauser and Jotzo 
2018). Much of the literature, including Sari and Akkaya (2016), 
Allan et al. (2017) and Garrett-Peltier (2017), points out that energy 
efficiency improvements deliver superior employment opportunities 
(SDG 8 – decent work and economic growth), while a limited number 
of studies have reported that it can negatively impact employment in 
fuel supply sectors (Costantini et al. 2018).
Many studies report that energy efficiency improvements are 
essential for supporting overall economic growth, contributing 
to positive changes in multi-factor productivity (SDGs 8  and 9  – 
decent work and economic growth and industry, innovation, and 
infrastructure)  (Lambert et al. 2014; Bataille and Melton 2017; 
Rajbhandari and Zhang 2018; Bashmakov 2019; Stern 2019) 
through industrial innovation (SDG 9) (Kang and Lee 2016), with 
some dissent (e.g., Mahmood and Ahmad 2018). Improved energy 
efficiency against a  background of growing energy prices helps 
industrial plants stay competitive (Bashmakov and Myshak 2018). 
Energy efficiency allows continued economic growth under strong 
environmental regulation. Given that energy efficiency measures 
reduce the combustion of fossil fuels it leads to reduced air pollution 
at industrial sites (Williams et al. 2012) and better indoor comfort at 
working places.
Since less energy supply infrastructure is needed in cities and less 
energy is needed to produce materials such as cement and concrete, 
and metals, energy efficiency indirectly supports ‘sustainable cities 
and communities’ (SDG 11) (Di Foggia 2018). In addition, energy 
efficiency in industry reflects achievements in meeting SDG 12 
(responsible consumption and production).
11.5.3.4 Sustainable Development Goals Co-benefits From 
Electrification and Fuel Switching
A key, generally underappreciated SDG benefit of electrification is 
improved urban and indoor air quality (at working places as well) 
and associated health benefits (SDG 3) from clean electrification 
(SDG 7) of industrial facilities (IEA 2016). With energy being such 
an important cross-cutting issue to sustainable development, 
some SDGs, such as SDGs 1, 3, 4  and 5  (Harmelink et al. 2018) 
are co-beneficiaries to using electrification and fuel switching as 
a climate action mitigation option.11.5.3.5 Sustainable Development Goals Co-benefits 
from Carbon Capture and Utilisation, 
and Carbon Capture and Storage
CCU and CCS have been identified as playing key roles in the 
transition of industry to net zero. Advancements in the development 
and deployment of both CCS and CCU foster climate action (SDG 13). 
Other co-benefits for CCS include control of non-CO 2 pollutants 
(SDG 3), direct foreign investment and know-how (SDG 9), enhanced 
oil recovery from existing resources, and diversified employment 
prospects and skills (SDG 8) (Bonner 2017). For CCU, the main 
co-benefit related contributions are expected within the context of 
energy transition processes, and in societal advancements that are 
linked to technological progress (Olfe-Kräutlein 2020). Therefore, the 
expectations are that the deployment of CCU technologies would 
have least potential for meeting the SDG targets relating to society/
people, compared with the anticipated contributions to the pillars of 
ecology and economy.
These mitigation options carry a  large number of risks as well. 
The high cost of the capture and storage process not only limit 
the technology penetration, but also make energy and products 
more expensive (risk to SDG 7), potential leaks from undersea or 
underground CO 2 storages carries risks for achieving SDGs 6, 14 and 
15. While there are economic costs involved with the deployment 
of CCS and  CCU (Bataille et al. 2018a), there are also significant 
economic and developmental costs associated with taking no action, 
because of the potential negative impact of climate change. CCS and 
CCU have been argued as providing public good (Bergstrom and Ty 
2017) and co-benefits to key SDGs (Schipper et al. 2011). On the 
other hand, Fan et al. (2018) among others have noted the potential 
lock-in of existing energy structures due to CCS. Refer to Table 17.1 
for CCS and CCU co-benefits with respect to other sector chapters.
11.6 Policy Approaches and Strategies
Industrial decarbonisation is technically possible on the mid-
century horizon, but requires scale up of technology development 
and deployment, multi-institutional coordination, and sectoral and 
national industrial policies with detailed subsectoral and regional 
mitigation pathways and transparent monitoring and evaluation 
processes (Åhman et al. 2017; Wesseling et al. 2017; Bataille 
et al. 2018a; Rissman et al. 2020; Nilsson et al. 2021). Transitions of 
industrial systems entail innovations, plant and technology phase-
outs, changes across and within existing value chains, new sectoral 
couplings, and large investments in enabling electricity, hydrogen, 
and other infrastructures. Low-carbon transitions are likely to be 
contested, non-linear and require a  multi-level perspective policy 
approach that addresses a  large spectrum of social, political, 
cultural and technical changes as well as accompanying phase-out 
policies, and involve a wide range of actors, including civil society 
groups, local authorities, labour unions and industry associations 
e(Geels et al. 2017; Rogge and Johnstone 2017; Yamada and Tanaka 
2019; Koasidis et al. 2020). See also Cross-Chapter Box 12.
Chapter 11 Industry11Deployment of the mitigation options presented in this chapter 
(Sections  11.3 and 11.4) needs support from a  mix of policy 
instruments including: GHG pricing coupled with border adjustments 
or other economic signals for trade-exposed industries; robust 
government support for research, development, and deployment; 
energy, material and emissions standards; recycling policies; 
sectoral technology roadmaps; market pull policies; and support for 
new infrastructure (Figure 11.15) ( Flanagan et al. 2011; Rogge et al. 
2017; Bataille et al. 2018a; Tvinnereim and Mehling 2018; Creutzig 
2019; Bataille 2020a; Rissman et al. 2020). The combination of the 
above will depend on specific sectoral market barriers, technology 
maturity, and local political and social acceptance (Hoppmann et al. 2013; Rogge and Reichardt 2016). Industrial decarbonisation 
policies need to be innovative and definitive about net zero CO 2 
emissions to trigger the level of investment needed for the profound 
changes in production, use and recycling of basic materials needed 
(Nilsson et al. 2021). Inclusive and transparent governance that 
assesses industry decarbonisation progress, monitors innovation 
and accountability, and provides regular recommendations for 
policy adjustments is also important for progressing (Mathy et al. 
2016; Bataille 2020a).

Industry  Chapter 1111energy efficiency is a well-established policy field with decades of 
experience from voluntary and negotiated agreements, regulations, 
standards, energy audits, and demand-side management (DSM) 
programmes (see AR5), but there are also many countries where 
the application of energy efficiency policy is absent or nascent (see 
AR5) (Tanaka 2011; Fischedick et al. 2014a; García-Quevedo and 
Jové-Llopis 2021; Saunders et al. 2021). The application of DSM 
and load flexibility will also need to grow with electrification and 
renewable energy integration.
Materials efficiency and circular economy are not well understood 
from a policy perspective and were for a long time neglected in low-
GHG industry roadmaps although they may represent significant 
potential (Allwood et al. 2011; Gonzalez Hernandez et al. 2018b; IEA 
2019b, 2020a; Calisto Friant et al. 2021; Polverini 2021). Material 
efficiency is also neglected in products design, architectural and civil 
engineering education, infrastructure and building codes, and 
urban planning (Section  5.6) (Braun et al. 2018; Orr et al. 2019). 
For example, the overuse of steel and concrete in construction is 
well documented but policies or strategies (e.g., design guidelines 
or regulation) for improving the situation are lacking (Dunant et al. 
2018; Shanks et al. 2019). Various circular economy solutions are 
gaining interest from policymakers with examples such as regulations 
and economic incentives for repair and reuse, initiatives to reduce 
planned obsolescence, and setting targets for recycling. Barriers that 
policies need to address are often specific to the different material 
loops (e.g., copper contamination for steel and lack of technologies 
or poor economics for plastics).
There is also a growing interest from policymakers in electrification 
and fuel switching but the focus has been mainly on innovation 
and on developing technical production-side solutions rather than 
on creating markets for enabling demand for low-carbon products, 
although the concept of green public procurement is gaining traction. 
The situation is similar for CCU and CCS. Low-carbon technologies 
adoption represents an additional cost to producers, and this must be 
handled through fiscal incentives like tax benefits, GHG pricing, green 
subsidies, regulation and permit procedures. For example, the 45Q tax 
credit provides some incentives to reduce investor risk for CCS and 
attract private investment in the USA (Ochu and Friedmann 2021).
Since industrial decarbonisation is only recently emerging as a policy 
field there is little international collaboration on facilitation (Oberthür 
et al. 2021). Given that most key materials markets are global and 
competitive, unless there is much greater global governance to 
contribute to the decarbonisation of GHG-intensive industry through 
intergovernmental and transnational institutions it is questionable 
that the world will achieve industry decarbonisation by 2050.
As GHG pricing, through GHG taxes or cap and trade schemes, has 
remained a  central avenue for climate policy, this section begins 
with a review of how the industrial sector has been concerned with 
these instruments. The rest of the section is then structured into 
five key topics, following insights on key failures that policy must 
address to enable and support large-scale transformations as well 
as the need for complementary mixes of policies to achieve this goal 
(Weber and Rohracher 2012; Rogge and Reichardt 2016; Grillitsch et al. 2019). The section describes how the need to focus on long-
term transitions rather than incremental changes can be managed 
through the planning and strategising of transition pathways; 
discusses the role of research, development, and innovation policy; 
highlights the need for enabling low-carbon demand and market 
creation; reflects on the necessity of establishing and maintaining 
a level of knowledge and capacity in the policy domain about the 
industrial transition challenge; and points to the critical importance 
of coherence across geographical and policy contexts. The section 
concludes with a reflection on how different groups of actors needs 
to take up different parts of the responsibility for mitigating climate 
change in the industrial sector.
11.6.1 GHG Prices and GHG Markets
Internalising the cost of GHG emissions in consumer choices 
and producer investment decisions has been a  major strategy 
promoted by economists and considered by policymakers to mitigate 
emissions cost-effectively and to incentivise low-GHG innovations 
in a purportedly technology neutral way (Stiglitz et al. 2017; Boyce 
2018). In the absence of a coordinated effort, individual countries, 
regions and cities have implemented carbon-pricing schemes. As of 

scheduled by law for implementation, covering 22.5% of global GHG 
emissions (World Bank 2020), 35 of which are carbon taxes, primarily 
implemented on a national level and 29 of which are emissions trading 
schemes, spread across national and sub-national jurisdictions.
Assessments of pricing mechanisms show generally that they lead 
to reduced emissions, even in sectors that receive free allocation 
such as industry (Martin et al. 2016; Haites et al. 2018; Narassimhan 
et al. 2018; Metcalf 2019; Bayer and Aklin 2020). However, questions 
remain as to whether these schemes can bring emissions down fast 
enough to reach the Paris Agreement goals (Boyce 2018; Tvinnereim 
and Mehling 2018; World Bank Group 2019). Most carbon prices 
are well below the levels needed to motivate investments in 
high-cost options that are needed to reach net zero emissions 
(Section 11.4.1.5). Among the 64 carbon-price schemes implemented 
worldwide today, only nine have carbon prices above USD40 (World 
Bank 2020). These are all based in Europe and include EU Emissions 
Trading System (ETS) (above USD40 since March 2021), Switzerland 
ETS, and seven countries with carbon taxes. Furthermore, emissions-
intensive and trade-exposed (EITE) industries are typically allowed 
exemptions and receive provisions that shelter them from any 
significant cost increase in virtually all pricing schemes (Haites 2018). 
These provisions have been allocated due to concerns about loss of 
competitiveness and carbon leakage which result from relocation and 
increased imports from jurisdictions with no, or weak, GHG emission 
regulations (Branger and Quirion 2014a; Branger and Quirion 2014b; 
Jakob 2021a). Embodied emissions in international trade accounts 
for one quarter of global CO 2 emissions in 2015 (Moran et al. 
2018) and has increased significantly over the past few decades, 
representing a  significant challenge to competitiveness related to 
climate policy. CBAM, or CBA are trade-based mechanisms designed 
to ‘equalise’ the carbon costs for domestic and foreign producers. 
They are increasingly being considered by policymakers to address 
Chapter 11 Industry11carbon leakage and create a level playing field for products produced 
in jurisdiction with no, or lower, carbon price (Mehling et al. 2019; 
Markkanen et al. 2021). On 14 July 2021, the European Commission 
adopted a proposal for a CBAM that requires importers of aluminium, 
cement, iron and steel, electricity and fertiliser to buy certificates at 
the ETS price for the emissions embedded in the imported products 
(European Commission 2021; Mörsdorf 2021). CBAMs should be 
crafted very carefully, to meet technical and legal challenges (Jakob 
et al. 2014; Sakai and Barrett 2016; Rocchi et al. 2018; Cosbey et al. 
2019; Joltreau and Sommerfeld 2019; Pyrka et al. 2020). Technical 
challenges arise because estimating the price adjustment requires 
reliable data on the GHG content of products imported as well as 
a  clear understanding of the climate policy  implications from the 
countries of imports. Application of pricing tools in industry requires 
standardisation (benchmarking) of carbon-intensity assessments at 
products, installations, enterprises, countries, regions, and the global 
level. The limited number of existing benchmarking systems are not 
yet harmonised and thus not able to fulfill this function effectively. 
This limits the scope of products that can potentially be covered by 
CBAM-type policies (Bashmakov et al. 2021a).
Legal challenges arise because CBAM can be perceived as 
a protectionist measure violating the principle of non-discrimination 
under the regulations of the World Trade Organization (WTO). However 
the absence of GHG prices can also been perceived as a  subsidy 
for fossil fuel-based production (Stiglitz 2006; Al Khourdajie and 
Finus 2020; Kuusi et al. 2020). Another argument supporting CBAM 
implementation is the possibility to induce low-GHG investment in 
non-regulated regions (Cosbey et al. 2019).
Thus far, California is the only jurisdiction that has implemented CBA 
tariffs applied on electricity imports from neighbouring states and 
provides insights on how a CBA can work in practice by using ‘default’ 
GHG emissions intensity benchmarks (Fowlie et al. 2021). CBAM is an 
approach likely to be applied first to a few selected energy-intensive 
industries that are at risk of carbon leakage, as the EU is considering. 
The implementation of CBA needs to balance applicability versus 
fairness of treatment. An option recently proposed is an individual 
adjustment mechanism to give companies exporting to the EU the 
option to demonstrate their actual carbon intensity (Mehling and Ritz 
2020). Any CBAMs will have to comply with multilaterally agreed 
rules under the WTO Agreements to be implemented.
The adoption of CBAM by different countries may evolve into 
the formation of a  climate club where countries would align on 
specific elements of climate regulation (e.g., primary iron or clinker 
intensity) to facilitate implementation and incentivise countries to 
join (Nordhaus 2015; Hagen and Schneider 2021; Tagliapietra and 
Wolff 2021a,b). However, not all countries have the same abilities 
to report, adapt and transition to low-carbon production. The 
implications of CBAMs on trade relationships should be considered 
to avoid country divide and separation from a  common goal of 
global decarbonisation (Michaelowa et al. 2019; Kuusi et al. 2020; 
Banerjee 2021; Eicke et al. 2021; Bashmakov 2021). The globalisation 
of markets and the fragmentation of supply chains complicates the 
assignment of responsibility for GHG emissions mitigations related 
to trade (Jakob et al. 2021). Production-based carbon-price schemes minimise the incentives for downstream carbon abatement due to 
the imperfect pass through of carbon costs and therefore overlook 
demand-side solutions such as material efficiency (Skelton and 
Allwood 2017; Baker 2018). An alternative approach is to set the 
carbon pricing downstream on the consumption of carbon-intensive 
materials, whether they are imported or produced locally (Neuhoff 
et al. 2015, 2019; Munnings et al. 2019). However, implementation 
of consumption-based GHG pricing is also challenged by the need 
of product GHG traceability and enforcement transaction costs 
(Jakob et al. 2014; Munnings et al. 2019). Hybrid approaches are 
also considered (Neuhoff et al. 2015; Bataille et al. 2018a; Jakob 
et al. 2021). The efficacy of GHG prices to achieve major industry 
decarbonisation has been challenged by additional real world 
implementation problems, such as highly regionally fragmented 
GHG markets (Boyce 2018; Tvinnereim and Mehling 2018) and the 
difficult social acceptance of price increases (Bailey et al. 2012; 
Raymond 2019). The higher GHG prices likely needed to incentivise 
industry to adopt low-GHG solutions pose social equity issues 
and resistance (Grainger and Kolstad 2010; Bataille et al. 2018b; 
Hourcade et al. 2018; Huang et al. 2019b; Wang et al. 2019). GHG 
pricing is also associated with promoting mainly incremental low-
cost options and not investments in radical technical change or 
the transformation of socio-technical systems (Grubb et al. 2014; 
Vogt-Schilb et al. 2018; Stiglitz 2019; Rosenbloom et al. 2020). 
Transparent and strategic management of cap-and-trade proceeds 
toward inclusive decarbonisation transition that support high 
abatement cost options can contribute toward easing these 
shortcomings (Carl and Fedor 2016; Raymond 2019). In California, 
Senate Bill 535 (De  León, Statutes of 2012) require that at least 
a quarter of the proceeds go to projects that provide a benefit to 
disadvantaged communities (California Climate Investments 2020).
Clear and firm emission reduction caps towards 2050 are essential 
for sending strong signals to businesses. However, many researchers 
recognise that complementary policies must be developed to 
set current production and consumption patterns toward a  path 
consistent with achieving the Paris Agreement goals as cap-and-
trade or carbon taxes are not enough (Schmalensee and Stavins 
2017; Vogt-Schilb and Hallegatte 2017; Bataille et al. 2018b; Kirchner 
et al. 2019). In this broader policy context, proceeds from pricing 
schemes can be used to support the deployment of options with 
near-term abatement costs that are too high to be incentivised by the 
prevailing carbon price, but which show substantial cost-reduction 
potential with scale and learning, and to ensure a  just transition 
(Wang and Lo 2021).
11.6.2 Transition Pathways Planning and Strategies
Decarbonising the industry sector requires transitioning how material 
and products are produced and used today to development pathways 
that include the strategies outlined in Sections 11.3 and 11.4 and 
Figure  11.15. Such broad approaches require the development 
of transition planning that assesses the impacts of the different 
strategies and considers local conditions and social challenges that 
may result from conflicts with established practices and interests, 
with planning and strategies directly linked to these challenges.
Industry  Chapter 1111Governments have traditionally used voluntary agreements 
or mandatory energy or emission reduction targets to achieve 
emission reduction for specific emission-intensive sectors (e.g., UK 
Climate Change Agreements; India Performance, Achieve and Trade 
scheme). Sector visions, roadmaps and pathways combined with 
a  larger context of socio-economic goals, with clear objectives 
and policy direction, are needed for every industrial sector to 
achieve decarbonisation and at the time of writing they are 
emerging for some sectors. Grillitsch et al. (2019b) working from 
the socio-technical transitions literature, focuses on the need 
for maintaining ‘directionality’ for innovation (e.g.,  towards net 
zero transformation), the capacity for iterative technological 
and policy ‘experimentation’ and learning, ‘demand articulation’ 
(e.g., engagement of material efficiency and high value circularity), 
and ‘policy coordination’ as four main framing challenges. Wesseling 
et al. (2017b) bridges from the socio-technical transitions literature 
to a  world more recognisable by executives and engineers, 
composed of structural components that include actors (e.g., firms, 
trade associations, government, research organisations, consumers, 
etc.), institutions (e.g., legal structures, norms, values and formal 
policies or regulations), technologies (e.g., facilities, infrastructure) 
and system interactions.
Several studies (Åhman et al. 2017; Bataille et al. 2018a; Material 
Economics 2019; Wyns et al. 2019) offer detailed transition plans using 
roughly the same five overarching strategies: (i) policies to encourage 
material efficiency and high quality circularity; (ii) ‘supply push’ R&D 
and early commercialisation as well as ‘demand pull’ to develop niche 
markets and help emerging technologies cross ‘the valley of death’; (iii) GHG pricing or regulations with competitiveness provisions to trigger 
innovation and systemic GHG reduction; (iv) long-run, low-cost finance 
mechanisms to enable investment and reduce risk; (v) infrastructure 
planning and construction (e.g. CO 2 transport and disposal, electricity 
and hydrogen transmission and storage), and institutional support 
(e.g., labour market training and transition support; electricity market 
reform). Wesseling et al. (2017b) and (Bataille et al. 2018a) further 
add a  step to conduct ongoing stakeholder engagements, including 
stakeholders with effective ‘veto’ power (i.e., firms, unions, government, 
communities, indigenous groups), to share and gather information, 
educate, debate, and build consensus for a robust, politically resilient 
policy package. This engagement of stakeholders can also bring on 
new supply chain collaborations and bridge the cost pass-through 
challenge (e.g.,  the Swedish HYBRIT steel project, or the ELYSIS 
consortium, with plans to bring fully commercialised inert electrodes 
for bauxite electrolysis to market by 2024).
Detailed sectoral roadmaps that assess the technical, economic, 
social and political opportunities and provide a clear path to low-
GHG development are needed to guide policy designs. For example, 
the German state of North Rhine Westphalia passed a Climate Process 
Law that resulted in the adoption of a Climate Protection Plan that 
set subsector targets through a transparent stakeholder engagement 
process based on scenario development and identification of low-
GHG options (Lechtenböhmer et al. 2015), see Box  11.3. Another 
example is the UK set of Industrial Decarbonisation and Energy 
Efficiency Roadmaps to 2050 as well as the UK Strategic Growth 
Plan, which are accompanied by Action Plans for each energy-
intensive subsector.
Box 11.3 | IN4Climate NRW – Initiative for a Climate-friendly Industry in North  
Rhine-Westphalia (NRW)
IN4Climate NRW (www.in4climate.nrw) was launched in September 2019 by the state government of North Rhine-Westphalia 
(IN4climate.NRW 2019) as a platform for collaboration between representatives from industry, science and politics. IN4climate.NRW 
offers a common space to develop innovative strategies for a carbon-neutral industrial sector, bringing together different perspectives 
and competencies.
North Rhine-Westphalia is Germany’s industrial heartland. Around 19% of North Rhine-Westphalia’s GHGs have their origin in the 
industry sector. Consequently, the sector bears a particular responsibility when it comes to climate protection, but the state is also 
a source of high-quality jobs and export value. The NRW government understands that the state’s current competitive advantage can 
only be maintained if the regional industry positions itself as a front runner for becoming GHG-neutral.
In working together across different branches (more than 30 companies representing mainly steel, cement, chemical, aluminium 
industry, refineries and energy utilities) and enabling a direct interaction between industry and government officials, IN4Climate 
provides a benefit to the participating companies. People from the different areas are working together in so-called innovation teams 
and underlying working groups with a self-organised process of setting their milestones and working schedule while reflecting long-
term needs as well as short-term requirements based on political or societal discussions.
The innovation teams aim to identify and set concrete impulses for development and implementation of breakthrough technologies, 
specify necessary infrastructures (e.g., for hydrogen production, storage and transport) and appropriate policy settings (i.e., integrated 
state, national and European policy mix). They also include an attempt to create a discourse between the public and the industry 
sectors as a kind of sounding board for the early detection of barriers and obstacles.
Chapter 11 Industry1111.6.3 Technological Research, 
Development, and Innovation
Policies for research, development, and innovation (RDI) for industry 
are present in most countries but it is only recently, and mainly in 
developed countries, that decarbonisation of emissions-intensive 
industries has been prioritised (Åhman et al. 2017; Nilsson et al. 2021). 
Emission-intensive industries are characterised by large dominant 
actors and mature process technologies with high fixed cost, long 
payback times and low profit margins on the primary production 
side of the value chain. Investments in RDI are commonly low and 
aimed at incremental improvements to processes and products 
(Wesseling et al. 2017).
11.6.3.1 Applied Research
Investing in RDI for low-GHG process emissions is risky and 
uncompetitive in the absence of convincing climate policy. Research 
investment should be guided by assessing options, technology 
readiness levels, and roadmaps towards technology demonstration 
and commercialisation. The potential GHG and environmental 
implications need to be assessed early on to assess the sustainability 
implications and to direct research needs (Yao and Masanet 2018; 
Zimmerman et al. 2020). Strategic areas for RDI can be focused on 
a set of possible process options for producing basic materials using 
fossil-free energy and feedstock, or CCU and CCS (Sections 11.3.5 
and 11.3.6). Policies to enhance RDI include public funding for 
applied research, technological and business model experimentation, 
pilot and demonstration projects, as well as support for education 
and training – which further have the positive side effect of leading 
to spill-overs and network effects through labour market mobility 
and collaboration (Nemet et al. 2018). Innovative business models 
will not emerge if the transition is not considered along the full 
value chain with a  focus on materials efficiency, circularity, and 
new roles for industry in a  transitioning energy system, including 
possibly providing demand response for electricity through designed-
in flexibility, for example, by combining electrolysis hydrogen 
production with substantial storage (Vogl et al. 2018).Fostering collaborative innovation across sectors through the 
support of knowledge sharing and capabilities building is important 
as mitigation options involve new or stronger sectoral couplings 
(Tönjes et al. 2020). One example is linking chemicals to forestry in 
the upscaling of forest bio-refineries, although it has proven to be 
difficult to engage a diverse group of actors in such collaborations 
(Karltorp and Sandén 2012; Bauer et al. 2018). Heterogeneous 
collaboration and knowledge exchange can be encouraged through 
conscious design of RDI programs and by supporting network 
initiatives involving diverse actor groups (Van Rijnsoever et al. 2015; 
Söderholm et al. 2019).
11.6.3.2 Policy Support From Demonstration to Market
Applied research is relatively inexpensive compared to piloting, 
demonstrations, and early commercialisation, and arguably a lot of it 
has already been done for the key technologies that need to climb the 
technology readiness ladder (see Table 11.3). This includes electricity 
and hydrogen-based processes, electro-thermal technologies, high-
temperature heat pumps, catalysis, lightweight building construction, 
low embodied carbon construction materials, etc. Demonstration to 
market strategies can be particularly successful when the complete 
supply chain is considered. A  prominent example of such an 
integrated supply chain approach is the UK Offshore Wind Accelerator 
Project. Coordinated by the UK Carbon Trust and working with wind 
turbine manufacturers, the project looked across the potential supply 
chain for floating offshore wind and identified what components 
manufacturers could innovate and produce by themselves, and where 
there were gaps beyond the capability of any one firm. This process 
led to several key areas of work where the government and firms 
could work together; once the concepts were piloted and proven, 
the firms went back into a competitive mode. The project illustrates 
the potential importance of third parties, including government, in 
creating platforms and opportunities for cross-industry exchange and 
collaboration (Tönjes et al. 2020).Box 11.3 (continued)
The initiative has been successful so far, for example, having developed a clear vision for a hydrogen strategy and an associated policy 
framework as well as a broader decarbonisation strategy for the whole sector. It is present at the national level as well as at the 
European level. Being successful and unique, IN4Climate is useful as a blueprint for other regions and is often visited by companies 
and administration staff from other German states.
It is particularly the so far missing intensive and dedicated cooperation across industrial subsectors that can be seen as a success 
factor. Facing substantial transformation needs associated with structural changes and infrastructure challenges, very often solutions 
can’t be provided and realised by a single sector but need cooperation and coordination. Even more, chicken-and-egg problems like 
the construction of new infrastructures (e.g., for hydrogen and CO 2 disposal) require cooperation and new modes of collaboration. 
IN4Climate provides the necessary link for this.
Industry  Chapter 1111Pilot and demonstration projects funded through public-private 
partnerships contributes to risk mitigation for industries and helps 
inform on the feasibility, performance, costs and environmental 
impacts of decarbonisation technologies. Most countries already 
maintain government research and deployment programs. For 
example, Horizon Europe has a  total budget of 95.5 billion EUR 
(USD117 billion) for 2021–2027, of which 30% will be directed 
to green technology research. The EU has conducted several 
demonstration projects for emission-intensive industries, such as 
the Ultra-Low Carbon Steel (ULCOS) project (Abdul Quader et al. 
2016), which led to several small-scale pilots that are now going 
to larger-scale firm pilots (e.g.,  HISARNA, HYBRIT and SIDERWIN). 
Supported by the EU, several cement firms are working together on 
the cement LEILAC project, where a new form of limestone calciner 
is being developed to concentrate the process CO 2 emerging from 
quicklime production (about 60% of cement emissions) for eventual 
utilisation or geological storage (as one of many options for cement, 
see for example, Plaza et al. 2020). If LEILAC works, it is conceivable 
that existing cement plants globally that are located near CCS 
opportunities could have their emissions reduced by 60% with one 
major retrofit of the kiln.
Once a technology has been demonstrated with scale-up potential, 
the next stage is commercialisation. This is a very expensive stage, 
where costs are not yet compensated by revenue (see, e.g., Åhman 
et al. 2018 and Nemet et al. 2018). The H-DRI, SIDERWIN and 
LEILAC examples are all at the stage of scaling up. Given the 
resource requirement, a  diversified portfolio of investors and 
support is required to share the risk. LEILAC includes several firms, 
as did the UK Offshore Wind Accelerator. Government funds are 
also required and could be refunded in the future through an 
equity position, royalty or tax. Fast-growing economies, which are 
adding new industrial capacity, can provide opportunities to pilot, 
demonstrate and scale up new technologies, as shown by the rapid 
expansion of electric vehicle and solar panel production in China, 
which contributed to driving down costs (Nemet 2019; Hsieh et al. 
2020; Jackson et al. 2021).
Finally, large capital flows towards deployment of low-GHG solutions 
will not materialise without a  growing demand for low-carbon 
materials and products that allows business opportunities. Policy will 
thus be needed to support the first niche markets which are essential 
for refining new decarbonised technologies, troubleshooting, and for 
building manufacturing economies of scale. Market creation does 
however go beyond the nurturing, shielding, and empowerment of 
early niches (Smith and Raven 2012; Raven et al. 2016) and must 
also consider how to significantly reshape existing markets to create 
space for decarbonised solutions and crowd out fossil-based ones 
(Mazzucato 2016).11.6.4 Market Pull
The perception of an increasing durable demand for low-GHG 
products induces manufacturers to invest in decarbonisation 
strategies (Olatunji et al. 2019). Policies can support and accelerate 
this process by creating niche markets,  stimulating demand for 
low-carbon products through procurement and financing and by 
addressing informational and other market barriers.
11.6.4.1 Public Procurement
Governments spend a large portion of their budget on the provision 
of products and material through infrastructure development, general 
equipment, and miscellaneous goods. The OECD estimates that an 
average of 30% of general government expenditure goes to public 
procurements in OECD countries, representing 12.6% of GDP , which 
makes government a  powerful market actor (OECD 2021). Public 
procurement can therefore create a significant market pull and be 
used to pursue strategic environmental goals (Ghisetti 2017). Local, 
regional and national authorities can use their purchasing power 
to create niche markets and to guarantee demand for low-GHG 
products and material (Wesseling and Edquist 2018; Muslemani et al. 
2021). In some cases, governments will have to adapt government 
procurement policies that are not well suited for the procurement 
of products and services that focus on the decarbonisation benefits 
and longer-term procurement commitments of emissions-reducing 
technologies and projects (Ghisetti 2017). Implementation can 
be challenged by the complexity of criteria, the lack of credible 
information to check GHG intensities and the added time needed 
for selection (Geng and Doberstein 2008; Testa et al. 2012; Bratt 
et al. 2013; Zhu et al. 2013; Cheng et al. 2018; Liu et al. 2019b). To 
ease these hurdles, the EU commission has developed environmental 
criteria that can be directly inserted in tender documents (Igarashi 
et al. 2015; European Commission 2016). These criteria are voluntary, 
and the extent of their application varies across public authorities 
(Michelsen and de Boer 2009; Bratt et al. 2013; Testa et al. 2016). In 
the Netherlands, companies achieving a desirable certification level 
under the national CO 2 Performance Ladder obtain a  competitive 
advantage in public procurement (Rietbergen and Blok 2013; 
Rietbergen et al. 2015). Globally, many countries have implemented 
green product procurement or sustainable procurement following 
Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12 – ‘Responsible consumption 
and production’ (UNEP 2017). Public procurement is also developing 
at sub-national levels. For example, the state of California in the 
United States of America passed the Buy Clean California Act (AB 262) 
that establishes maximum acceptable global warming potentials for 
eligible steel and glass construction materials for public procurement 
(USGBC-LA 2018) (Box 11.4).
Chapter 11 Industry1111.6.4.2 Private Procurement
The number of companies producing sustainability reports has 
increased rapidly over the last decade (Jackson and Belkhir 2018) and 
so has the number of pledges to carbon neutrality announced. This 
trend has mainly been driven by consumer concerns, investor requests, 
and as a business strategy to gain a competitive advantage (Higgins 
and Coffey 2016; Ibáñez-Forés et al. 2016; Koberg and Longoni 2019). 
For example, Apple and the governments of Québec and Canada are 
the financier and lead market maker in the Elysis consortium to bring 
inert electrodes to market for bauxite smelting to make zero-GHG 
aluminium. Aluminium is a very small fraction of the cost of a laptop 
or smartphone, so even expensive low-emissions aluminium adds to 
Apple’s brand at very little cost per unit sold. Some countries are also 
requiring corporate to report their emissions. For example, the French 
government requires companies with 500 or more employees and 
financial institutions to report Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 
and disclose publicly Scope 1  (direct emissions), Scope 2  (indirect 
emissions from purchased electricity) and Scope 3 (emissions from 
supply chain impacts and consumer usage and end-of-life recycling 
practices) emissions (Mason et al. 2016).
The most common climate mitigation strategies used by corporates 
are to set emissions reduction targets in line with the Paris Agreement 
goals through science-based targets (SBTs) and to develop internal 
carbon pricing (Kuo and Chang 2021). The SBT initiative records 
that 338 SBT companies reduced their emissions by 302 MtCO 2-eq between 2015 and 2019 (SBTi 2021). As of August  2021, 

world currently use internal carbon pricing with a median internal 
carbon price of USD25 per metric tonne of CO 2-eq (Bartlett et al. 
2021). The most determined companies have developed internal GHG 
abatement strategies that incorporate their supply chains’ emissions 
(Martí et al. 2015; Gillingham et al. 2017; Tost et al. 2020) and design 
procurement contracts that encourage or require their suppliers 
to also improve their product GHG footprint (Liu et al. 2019a). For 
many corporations, the emissions impact within their supply chain 
far exceeds their operations direct emissions (CDP 2019). Therefore, 
the opportunities to reduce emissions through purchasing goods 
and services from the supply chain (Scope 3) have much greater 
potentials than from direct emissions.
However, these trends have to be approached with caution as some 
of the emissions reductions are not direct emissions reductions 
from companies’ operations, instead often from offset projects of 
varying quality (Chrobak 2021). There is a lack of consistency and 
comparability in the way firms are reporting emissions, which limits 
the possibilities to assess companies’ actual ambition and progress 
(Sullivan and Gouldson 2012; Burritt and Schaltegger 2014; Liu et al. 
2015; Rietbergen et al. 2015; Blanco et al. 2016). More research 
is needed to assess the current impacts of corporate voluntary 
climate actions and if these efforts meet the Paris Agreement’s goals 
(Rietbergen et al. 2015; Wang and Sueyoshi 2018). It will be critically 
important that the international corporate accounting frameworks, Box 11.4 | Buy Clean California Act
In October 2017, California passed Assembly Bill (AB) 262, the Buy Clean California Act, a new law requiring state-funded building 
projects to consider the global warming potential (GWP) of certain construction materials during procurement. The goal of AB 262 is 
to use California’s substantial purchasing power to buy low-carbon products. Such low-carbon public procurement will directly reduce 
emissions by using lower-carbon products, and indirectly by sending a market signal to manufacturers to reduce their emissions in 
order to stay competitive in California.
The bill requirements are two-pronged: as of January 2020, manufacturers of eligible materials must submit a  facility-specific 
environmental product declaration (EPD), and the eligible materials must demonstrate (through submitted EPDs) GWP below 
the product-specific compliance limits defined by the state Department of General Services (DGS), which will regulate policy 
implementation. The eligible materials include structural steel, carbon steel rebar, flat glass, and mineral wool insulation. In January 
2021, the DGS published maximum acceptable GWP limits for each product category set at the industry average of facility-specific 
GWP for each material. Beginning 1 July 2021, awarding authorities were required to verify GWP compliance for all eligible materials 
(USGBC-LA 2018; DGS 2020).
Prior to adoption of the Buy Clean California Act, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) had been evaluating the use of 
lifecycle assessment and EPDs in evaluating materials. In addition to the materials specified in Buy Clean California Act (noted above), 
the Caltrans project includes materials used extensively in transportation (concrete, asphalt, and aggregate). Also, the California High-
Speed Rail project had begun using EPDs as part of its procurement process. The High-Speed Rail Sustainability Report states that the 
construction projects will: (i) require EPDs for construction materials including steel products and concrete mix designs, and (ii) require 
‘optimized lifecycle scores for major materials’ and include additional strategies to reduce impacts across the life cycle of the project 
(Simonen et al. 2019).
Several other states such as Washington, Minnesota, Oregon, Colorado, New York and New Jersey are developing similar types of Buy 
Clean regulations (Simonen et al. 2019; BGA 2020).
Industry  Chapter 1111standards, and related guidance (e.g., GHG Protocol) be maintained 
and improved to reflect evolving needs in the global market and to 
allow for comparison of objectives and progress.
11.6.4.3 GHG Content Certifications
The development of GHG labels corresponds to a growing demand 
from consumers desiring information about the climate impacts of 
their consumption (Darnall et al. 2012; Tan et al. 2014; Feucht and 
Zander 2018). GHG labels fill this information gap by empowering 
consumers’ purchasing decisions and creating higher value for 
low-GHG products and materials (Vanclay et al. 2011; Cohen and 
Vandenbergh 2012). The willingness to pay for lower-GHG products 
has been found to be positive but to depend on socio-economic 
consumer characteristics, cultural preferences and the product 
considered (Shuai et al. 2014; de-Magistris and Gracia 2016; Tait 
et al. 2016; Li et al. 2017; Feucht and Zander 2018). Companies and 
governments that favour low-GHG products and who are seeking to 
achieve environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals also need 
readily available and reliable information about the GHG content of 
products and materials they purchase and produce (Long and Young 
2016; Munasinghe et al. 2016).
Numerous methodologies have been developed by public and 
private organisations to meet the needs for credible and comparable 
environmental metrics at the product and organisation levels. Most 
follow lifecycle assessment standards as described in ISO 14040 and 
ISO 14044, ISO 14067 for climate change footprint only and ISO 14025 
(2006) for environmental product declarations (EPD), but the way 
system boundaries are applied in practice varies (Wu et al. 2014; Liu 
et al. 2016). Adoption has been challenged by the complexity and the 
profusion of applications which contribute to confuse stakeholders 
(Gadema and Oglethorpe 2011; Guenther et al. 2012; Brécard 2014). 
The options of applying different system boundaries and allocation 
principles involve value judgements that in turn influence the results 
(Tanaka 2008; Finnveden et al. 2009; McManus et al. 2015; Overland 
2019). A  more systematic and coordinated international approach 
based on transparent and reliable data and methodologies is needed 
to induce global low-GHG market development (Pandey et al. 2011; 
Darnall et al. 2012; Tan et al. 2014).
Within the context of GHG content certifications and EPD 
development, more transparency is needed to increase international 
comparability and to validate claims to meet consumers demand 
for low-GHG material and products (Rangelov et al. 2021). Greater 
automation, publicly available reference databases, benchmarking 
systems and increased stakeholder collaboration can also support the 
important role of conveying credible emissions information between 
producers, traders and consumers.
11.6.4.4 Performance Standards and Codes
Policymakers can set minimum performance standards or maximum 
emission content specifications through legislation to increase the 
use of low-GHG materials and products by mandating the adoption 
of low-GHG production and construction processes while requiring 
material and resource efficiency aspects.Construction of buildings represented 11% of energy and process-
related CO 2 emissions globally in 2018 (IEA and UNEP 2019). The 
share of embodied emissions in construction is increasing as building 
energy efficiency is improving and energy supply is decarbonised 
(Chastas et al. 2016). As a  result, jurisdictions are increasingly 
considering new requirements in building codes to reduce embodied 
emissions. This is the case of France’s new building code which is 
shifting from a  thermal regulation (RT 2012) to an environmental 
regulation (RE 2020) to include embodied GHG LCA metrics for 
encouraging use of low-GHG building materials (Ministère de 
la Transition écologique et solidaire 2018; Schwarz et al. 2020). 
The 2018 International Green Construction Code (IGCC) provides 
technical requirements that can be adopted by jurisdictions for 
encouraging low-GHG building construction, which also covers 
minimum longevity and durability of structural, building envelope, 
and hardscape materials (Art. 1001.3.2.3) (Celadyn 2014). Low-GHG 
building rating systems, such as LEEDs, are voluntary standards which 
include specific requirements on material resources in their rating 
scale. Trade-offs between energy performance achievement and 
material used in building construction needs to be further assessed 
and considered as low-GHG building code requirements develop. 
Local governments can also lead the way by adopting standards 
for construction. This is the case of the county of Marin in California 
which specifies maximum embodied carbon in kgCO 2-eq m–3 and 
maximum ordinary Portland cement content in lbs/yd3 for different 
levels of concrete compressive strength (Marin County 2021).
Governments are also turning their attention to developing standards 
to increase the durability of products and materials by requiring 
options for maintenance, reparability, reusability, upgradability, 
recyclability and waste handling. For example, the EU Ecodesign 
Directive includes new requirements for manufacturers to make 
available for a minimum of seven to 10 years spare parts to repair 
household equipment (Talens Peiró et al. 2020; Calisto Friant et al. 
2021; Nikolaou and Tsagarakis 2021). The European Commission 
plans to widen the resource efficiency requirements beyond energy-
related products to cover products such as textiles and furniture as 
well as high-impact intermediary products such as steel, cement and 
chemicals in a new sustainable product policy legislative initiative. 
(Domenech and Bahn-Walkowiak 2019; Llorente-González and 
Vence 2019; European Commission 2020; Polverini 2021).
Further research is needed to understand how different international 
and national frameworks, codes, and standards that focus on 
emissions can work in unison to amplify their mutually desired 
outcomes. Building performance and market instrument trading 
frameworks recognised globally do not always incentivise the same 
outcomes due to the differences in market approach. LCA metrics are 
a  useful tool to help assess optimal options for ultimate emission 
reduction objectives (Röck et al. 2020; Shadram et al. 2020).
11.6.4.5 Financial Incentives
Fossil-free basic materials production will often lead to higher 
costs of production, for example, 20–40% more for steel, 70–115% 
more for cement, and potentially 15–60% for chemicals (Material 
Economics 2019). There is a nascent literature on what are effectively 
Chapter 11 Industry11material ‘feed-in-tariffs’ to bridge the commercialisation ‘valley of 
death’ (Wilson and Grubler 2011) of early development of low-GHG 
materials (Bataille et al. 2018a; Neuhoff et al. 2018; Sartor and Bataille 
2019; Wyns et al. 2019). Renewable electricity support schemes have 
typically been price-based (e.g.,  production subsidies and feed-
in-tariffs) or volume-based (e.g.,  quota obligations and certificate 
schemes) and both principles can be applied when thinking about 
low-GHG materials. Auction schemes are typically used for larger-
scale projects, for example, offshore wind parks.
Based on how feed-in-tariffs worked, a  contract for difference 
(CfD) could guarantee a  minimum and higher-than-market price 
for a given volume of early low-GHG materials. CfDs could be based 
on a minimum effective GHG price reflecting parity with the costs of 
current higher-emitting technologies, or directly on the higher base 
capital and operating costs for a  lower-GHG material (Richstein 
2017; Chiappinelli et al. 2019; Sartor and Bataille 2019; Vogl 
et al. 2021a). CfDs can also be offered through low-GHG material 
procurement where an agreed price offsets the incremental cost 
of buying low-GHG content product or material. Private firms, by 
themselves or collectively, can also guarantee a higher than market 
price for low-GHG materials from their supplier for marketing 
purposes (Bataille et al. 2018a; Bataille 2020a). Reverse auctions 
(by which the lowest bidder gets the production subsidy) for low-
GHG materials is also an option but it remains to be analysed 
and explored. While these financial incentive schemes have been 
implemented for renewable energy, their application to incentivise 
and support low-GHG material production have yet to be developed 
and implemented. The German government is currently developing 
a draft law which will allow companies that commit to cut GHG 
emissions by more than half using innovative technologies to bid for 
10-year CfDs with a guaranteed price for low-carbon steel, chemical 
and cement products (Agora Energiewende and Wuppertal Institut 
2019; BMU 2021).
New and innovative financial market contracts for basic materials 
that represent low-carbon varieties of conventional materials are 
emerging. This is the case of aluminium for which quantity of low-GHG production already exist in countries where hydroelectric power 
is a common power source. Market developments will allow for low-
GHG aluminium to trade at a premium rate as demand develops. For 
example, Harbor Aluminium has launched a green aluminium spot 
premium at the end of October 2019 and the London Metal Exchange 
has introduced a ‘green aluminium’ spot exchange contract. (LME 
2020; Das 2021).
11.6.4.6 Extended Producer Responsibility
Extended producer responsibility (EPR) systems are increasingly 
used by policymakers to require producers to take responsibility for 
the end life of their outputs and to cover the cost of recycling of 
materials or otherwise responsibly managing problematic wastes 
(Kaza et al. 2018). According to the OECD, there are about 400 EPR 
systems in operation worldwide, three quarters of which have been 
established over the last two decades. One third of EPR systems cover 
small consumer electronic equipment, followed by packaging and 
tyres (each 17%), vehicles, lead-acid batteries and a range of other 
products (OECD 2016).
While the economic value of some discarded materials such as steel, 
paper and aluminium is generally high enough to justify the cost 
and efforts of recycling, at current rates of 85%, above 60%, and 
43%, respectively (Graedel et al. 2011; Cullen and Allwood 2013), 
others like plastic or concrete have a much lower re-circularity value 
(Graedel et al. 2011). Most plastic waste ends up in landfills or 
dumped in the environment, with 9% recycled and 12% incinerated 
globally (Geyer et al. 2017; UNEP 2018). Collected waste plastics 
from OECD countries were largely exported to China until a ban in 

2019). EPR schemes may thus need to be strengthened to actually 
achieve a  reduced use of virgin GHG-intensive materials. The 
potential for re-circularity of unreacted cement and aggregates in 
concrete is increasing as new standards and requirement develops. 
For example, concrete fines are now standardised as a new cement 
constituent in the European standardisation CEN/TC 51 – ‘cements

The implementation of a circular economy relies on the operationalisation of the R-imperatives or strategies which extend from 
the original 3Rs: Reduce, Reuse and Recycle, with the addition of Refuse, Reduce, Resell/Reuse, Repair, Refurbish, Remanufacture, 
Repurpose, Recycle, Recover (energy), Re-mine and more (Reike et al. 2018). The R  implementation strategies are diverse across 
countries (Ghisellini et al. 2016; Kalmykova et al. 2018) but, in practice, the lower forms of retention of materials, such as recycling 
and recover (energy), often dominate. The lack of policies for higher retention of material use such as Reduce, Reuse, Repair and 
Remanufacture is due to institutional failures, lack of coordination and lack of strong advocates (Gonzalez Hernandez et al. 2018a).
Policies addressing market barriers to circular business development need to demonstrate that circular products meet quality 
performance standards, ensure that the full environmental costs are reflected in market prices and foster market opportunities for 
circular products exchange, notably through industrial symbiosis clusters and trading platforms (Kirchherr et al. 2018; OECD 2019a; 
Hartley et al. 2020; Hertwich 2020). Policy levels span from micro (such as consumer or company) to meso (eco-industrial parks) and 
macro (provinces, regions and cities) (Geng et al. 2019). The creation of eco-industry parks (‘industrial clusters’) has been encouraged 
by governments to facilitate waste exchanges between facilities, where by-products from one industry are used as a feedstock to
Industry  Chapter 111111.6.5 Knowledge and Capacity
It is important that government bodies, academia and other 
actors strengthen their knowledge and capacities for the broad 
transformational changes envisioned for industry. In Japan, industry 
has been voluntarily working on GHG reduction, under the Framework 
of Keidanren’s Commitment to a  Low-carbon Society since 2009. 
Government and scientific experts regularly review their commitments 
and discuss results, monitoring methods, and reconsidering goals. 
Industry federations/associations can obtain advice in the follow-
up meetings from other industries and academics. The energy and 
transport sectors have decades of building institutions and expertise, 
whereas industrial decarbonisation is largely a new policy domain. 
Most countries have experience in energy efficiency policies, some 
areas of research and innovation, waste management, regulations 
for operational permits and pollution control, worker safety and 
perhaps fuel switching. There is less experience with market demand 
pull policies although low-GHG public procurement is increasingly 
being tested. Circular economy policies are evolving but potential 
policies for managing material demand growth are less understood. 
Material efficiency policies through, for example, product standards 
or regulation against planned obsolescence are nascent but relatively 
unexplored (Gonzalez Hernandez et al. 2018a).
All this argues for active co-oversight, management and assessment 
by government, firms, sector associations and other actors, in 
effect the formation of an active industrial policy that includes 
decarbonisation in its broader mandate of economic and social 
development (OECD 2019b; Bataille 2020a). This could draw from 
the quadruple helix innovation model, which considers the role of 
government, universities, the private sector, the natural environment 
and social systems to foster collaboration in innovation (Carayannis 
and Campbell 2019; Durán-Romero et al. 2020). Important aspects of 
governance include mechanisms for monitoring, transparency, and 
accountability. It may involve the development of new evaluation 
approaches, including a  greater focus on ex ante evaluations and 
assessment of, for example, readiness and capacities, rather than ex post evaluations of outcomes. Such organisational routines for 
learning have been identified as a key aspect of policy capacity to 
govern evolutionary processes (Karo and Kattel 2018; Kattel and 
Mazzucato 2018). Although many governments have adopted ideas 
of focusing resources on the mission or challenge of climate change 
mitigation, comparisons between Western and East Asian contexts 
show significant differences in the implementation of governance 
structures (Karo 2018; Mazzucato et al. 2020; Wanzenböck 
et al. 2020). Overall, improved knowledge and stronger expertise is 
important also to handle information asymmetries and the risk of 
regulatory capture.
11.6.6 Policy Coherence and integration
Industrial net zero transitions, while technically feasible, involve not 
just a  shift in production technology but major shifts in demand, 
material efficiency, circularity, supply chain structure and geographic 
location, labour training and adaptation, finance, and industrial policy. 
This transition must also link decarbonisation to larger environmental 
and social goals (e.g,. air and water quality, low-GHG growth, poverty 
alleviation, sustainable development goals) (OECD 2019b).
Although there is little evidence of carbon leakage so far it will 
be ever more important to strive for coherence in climate and 
trade policies as some countries take the lead in decarbonising 
internationally traded basic materials (Jakob 2021b). At the time 
of writing the previously academic debate on this issue is shifting 
to real policymaking through debates and negotiations around 
carbon border adjustment (Section 11.6.1) and sectoral agreements 
or climate clubs (Nordhaus 2015; Åhman et al. 2017; Jakob 2021a; 
Nilsson et al. 2021). The climate and trade policy integration should 
also consider what is sometimes called positive leakage, that is that 
heavy industry production moves to where it is easier to reach zero 
emissions. As a  result, policy should go beyond border measures 
to include, for example, international technology cooperation and 
transfer and development of shared lead markets.Box 11.5 (continued)
another (Ding and Hua 2012; Jiao and Boons 2014; Shi and Yu 2014; Tian et al. 2014; Winans et al. 2017). Systematic assessment 
of wastes and resources is carried out to assess possible exchange between different supply chains and identify synergies of waste 
streams that include metal scraps, waste plastics, water heat, bagasse, paper, wood scraps, ash, sludge and others (Ding and Hua 
2012; Shi and Yu 2014).
The development of data collection and indicators is nascent and need to ramp up to quantify the impacts and provide evidence to 
improve circular economy and materials efficiency policies. Policymakers need to leverage the potential socio-economic opportunities 
of transitioning to circular economies (Llorente-González and Vence 2020), which shows positive GDP growth and job creation by 
shifting to more labour-intensive recycling plants and repair services than resource-extraction activities (WRAP and Alliance Green 
2015; Cambridge Econometrics et al. 2018). The International Labour Organization estimates that worldwide employment would grow 
by 0.1% by 2030 under a circular economy scenario (ILO 2018). However questions remain if the type of jobs created are concentrated 
in low-wage labour-intensive circular activities which may need targeted policy instruments to improve working conditions (Llorente-
González and Vence 2020).
Chapter 11 Industry11Energy-intensive production steps may move where clean resources 
are most abundant and relatively inexpensive (Gielen et al. 2020; 
Bataille et al. 2021a). For example, steel-making has historically 
located itself near iron ore and coal resources whereas in the future 
it may be located near iron ore and zero-GHG electricity or close 
to carbon storage sites (Fischedick et al. 2014b; Vogl et al. 2018; 
Bataille 2020a). This indicates large changes in industrial and supply 
chain structure, with directly associated needs for employment and 
skills. Some sectors will grow, and some will shrink, with differing 
skill needs. Each new workforce cohort needs the general specific 
skill to provide the employment that is needed at each stage in 
the transition, implicating a need for coordination with policies for 
education and retraining.
Depending on what mixes of deep decarbonisation strategies are 
followed in a given region (e.g., material efficiency, electrification, 
hydrogen, biomass, CCU and CCS), infrastructure will need to be 
planned, financed and constructed. The UKCCC Net Zero Technical 
Report describes the infrastructure needs for achieving net zero 
GHG in the UK by 2050 for every sector of the economy (UKCCC 
2019b). Transportation would be facilitated with pipelines or ships 
to allow transfer of captured CO 2 for utilisation and disposal, and 
associated institutional frameworks (IEAGHG 2021). Electrification 
will require market design and transmission to support increased 
generation, transmission, and flexible demand. Hydrogen, CCU, and 
CCS will require significant new or adapted infrastructure. Hydrogen 
and CO 2 pipelines, and expanded electricity transmission, have 
natural monopoly characteristics which are normally governed and 
planned by national and regional grid operators and their regulators. 
Industrial clustering (also known as eco-parks), such as those 
planned in Rotterdam (Netherlands) and Teeside (UK), would allow 
more physical and cost-effective sharing of electricity, CCU, CCS, 
and hydrogen infrastructure but is dependent on physical planning, 
permitting, and infrastructure policies.
Costing analysis (Chapter  15) indicates an increased upfront 
need for financial capital which requires policies to encourage 
long-term, patient capital that reflects society’s preferences for investment in industrial decarbonisation and the minimum 10 or 
more years horizon before there are significant new commercially 
available processes.
All the above indicate the need for general industrial policy as part of 
a coherent general economic, taxation, investment, employment and 
social policy for climate change mitigation (Wesseling et al. 2017; 
Bataille et al. 2018a; Wyns et al. 2019; Nilsson et al. 2021).
11.6.7 Roles and Responsibilities
While all climate policy requires topic-specific adaptive governance 
for long-term effectiveness (Mathy et al. 2016), deep decarbonisation 
of heavy industry has special governance challenges, different from 
those for the electricity, transport or buildings sectors (Åhman et al. 
2017; Wesseling et al. 2017; Bataille et al. 2018a). Competition is 
strong, investments are rare, capital intensive and very ‘lumpy’. In an 
atmosphere where transformative innovation is required the process 
is very capital-focused with non-diversifiable risks unless several 
companies are involved. There are significant infrastructure needs for 
electricity, hydrogen, and CCS and CCU. Given there is no ‘natural’ 
market for low-emissions materials, there is a  need to manage 
both the supply and demand sides of the market, especially in early 
phase through lead supplier and markets. Finally, there is a very high 
probability of surprises and substantial learning, which could affect 
policy choice, direction, and stringency.
Different types of actors thus have to play different but coordinated 
roles and responsibilities in developing, supporting, and implementing 
policies for an industrial transition. Table  11.6 below shows how 
the different core parts of integrated policymaking for an industrial 
transition may depend on efforts from different actors groups and 
highlights the responsibility of these actor groups in developing 
a  progressive and enabling policy context for the transition. 
This  includes policymakers at local, national, and international 
arenas as well as civil society organisations, industry firms, and 
interest organisations.

of agency and wide stakeholder engagement in the governance of industrial decarbonisation.

Industry  Chapter 111111.7 Knowledge Gaps
An increasing body of research proposes deep decarbonisation 
pathways for energy-intensive industries including mitigation 
options such as materials efficiency, circular economy and new 
primary processes. These options are under-represented in climate 
change scenario modelling and integrated assessment models, some 
of which do not even reflect evolution of demand for basic materials, 
which is a key driver behind energy consumption and GHG emissions 
in the industrial sector. As a result, no agreement is reached so far 
between bottom-up and top-down studies on the effectiveness and 
costs for many promising mitigation options, their respective roles, 
sequencing and packaging within various mitigation pathways.
A significant shift is needed from the transition process of the past 
mainly based on marginal and incremental changes, with a strong 
focus on energy efficiency efforts, to one grounded in transformational 
change where there is limited knowledge of how to implement such 
change effectively.
There is a  knowledge gap on comparable, comprehensive, and 
detailed quantitative information on costs and potentials associated 
with the mitigation options for deep decarbonisation in industry, 
as cost estimates are not often comparable due to the regional or 
country focus, differences in costs metrics, currencies, discount rates, 
and energy prices across studies and regions.
A very large and important uncertainty is the availability of biomass 
for deep decarbonisation pathways due to competition for biomass 
feedstock with other priorities and the extent to which electrification 
can reduce the demand for bioenergy in the industry, transport and 
energy sectors.
CCS and CCU are important mitigation options in industry, for which 
the potentials and costs vary considerably depending on the diversity of industrial processes, the volume and purity of carbon dioxide 
flows, the energy requirements, the lifetime of utilisation products 
and the production route.
The effectiveness of mitigation policies in industry is poorly known, 
as so far the sector has largely been sheltered from the impacts of 
climate policy due to the concerns of competitiveness and carbon 
leakage. There is a  lack of integration of material efficiency and 
circularity with energy and climate policies which partly results from 
the inadequacy of monitored indicators to inform policy debates 
and set targets, a  lack of high-level political focus, a  history of 
strong industrial lobbying, uncoordinated policy across subsectors 
and institutions, and the sequential nature of decision-making 
along supply chains.
Industry as a whole is a very complex web of sectors, subsectors and 
inter-sectoral interactions and dependence, with diverse associated 
mitigation opportunities and co-benefits and costs. Additional 
knowledge is needed to understand sectoral interactions in the 
transformation processes.
Industrial climate mitigation policy is supplemental to many other 
policy instruments developed to reach multiple industrial goals, for 
the range of stakeholders with their interest and priorities reflecting 
the assessment of co-benefits and risk and affecting decision-making 
processes and behaviour of stakeholders. Better knowledge is 
needed to identify the co-benefits for the adoption of climate change 
mitigation strategies.ActorsDirection:

Chapter 11 Industry11Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
FAQ 11.1 |  What are the key options to reduce industrial emissions?
Industry has a  diverse set of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission sources across subsectors. To decarbonise industry requires that 
we pursue several options simultaneously. These include energy efficiency, materials demand management, improving materials 
efficiency, more circular material flows, electrification, as well as carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) and carbon capture and 
storage (CCS). Improved materials efficiency and recycling reduces the need for primary resource extraction and the energy-intensive 
primary processing steps. Future recycling may include chemical recycling of plastics if quality requirements make mechanical 
recycling difficult. One approach, albeit energy intensive, is to break down waste plastics to produce new monomer building blocks, 
potentially based on biogenic carbon and hydrogen instead of fossil feedstock. Hydrogen can also be used as a reduction agent 
instead of coke and coal in ironmaking. Process emissions from cement production can be captured and stored or used as feedstock 
for chemicals and materials. Electricity and hydrogen needs can be very large but the potential for renewable electricity, possibly in 
combination with other low carbon options, is not a limiting factor.
FAQ 11.2 |   How costly is industrial decarbonisation and will there be synergies  
or conflicts with sustainable development?
In most cases and in early stages of deployment, decarbonisation through electrification or CCS will make the primary production 
of basic materials such as cement, steel, or polyethylene more expensive. However, demand management, energy and materials 
efficiency, and more circular material flows can dampen the effect of such cost increases. In addition, the cost of energy-intensive 
materials is typically a very small part of the total price of products, such as an appliance, a bottle of soda or a building, so the effect 
on consumers is very small. Getting actors to pay more for zero-emission materials is a challenge in supply chains with a strong focus 
on competitiveness and cutting costs, but it is not a significant problem for the broader economy. Reduced demand for services such 
as square metres of living space or kilometres of car travel is an option where material living standards are already high. If material 
living standards are very low, increased material use is often needed for more sustainable development. The options of materials 
and energy efficiency, and more circular material flows, generally have synergies with sustainable development. Increased use of 
electricity, hydrogen, CCU and CCS may have both positive and negative implications for sustainable development and thus require 
careful assessment and implementation for different contexts.
FAQ 11.3 | What needs to happen for a low-carbon industry transition?
Broad and sequential policy strategies for industrial development and decarbonisation that pursue several mitigation options at 
the same time are more likely to result in resource-efficient and cost-effective emission reductions. Industrial decarbonisation is 
a relatively new field and thus building capacity for industrial transition governance is motivated. For example, policy to support 
materials efficiency or fundamental technology shifts in primary processes is less developed than energy efficiency policy and carbon 
pricing. Based on shared visions or pathways for a zero-emission industry, industrial policy needs to support development of new 
technologies and solutions as well as market creation for low- and zero-emission materials and products. This implies coordination 
across several policy domains including research and innovation, waste and recycling, product standards, digitalisation, taxes, 
regional development, infrastructure, public procurement, permit procedures and more to make the transition to a carbon neutral 
industry. International competition means that trade rules must be evolved to not conflict with industrial decarbonisation. Some 
local and regional economies may be disadvantaged from the transition which can motivate re-education and other support.
