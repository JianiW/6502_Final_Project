Cross-sectoral Perspectives  Chapter 1212
Executive Summary
The total emission mitigation potential achievable by the year 
2030, calculated based on sectoral assessments, is sufficient 
to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to half of the 
current (2019) level or less (robust evidence, high agreement). 
This potential (32–44 GtCO 2-eq) requires implementation of a wide 
range of mitigation options. Options with mitigation costs lower 
than USD20 tCO 2–1 make up more than half of this potential and are 
available for all sectors. {12.2, Table 12.3}
Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is a  necessary element to 
achieve net zero CO 2 and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions both 
globally and nationally, counterbalancing residual emissions 
from hard-to-transition sectors. It is a key element in scenarios 
that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower by 2100 (robust 
evidence,  high agreement). Implementation strategies need to 
reflect that CDR methods differ in terms of removal process, timescale 
of carbon storage, technological maturity, mitigation potential, cost, 
co-benefits, adverse side effects, and governance requirements. 
All Illustrative Mitigation Pathways (IMPs) use land-based biological 
CDR (primarily afforestation/reforestation (A/R)) and/or bioenergy with 
carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and some include direct air carbon 
capture and storage (DACCS). As a median value (5–95% range) across 
the scenarios that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower, cumulative 
volumes of BECCS, CO 2 removal from AFOLU (mainly A/R), and 
DACCS reach 328 (168–763) gigatonnes of CO 2 equivalent (GtCO 2), 

period, with annual volumes at 2.75  (0.52–9.45)  GtCO 2 yr–1 for 
BECCS, 2.98 (0.23–6.38) GtCO 2 yr–1 for the CO 2 removal from AFOLU 
(mainly A/R), and 0.02 (0–1.74) GtCO 2 yr–1 for DACCS, in 2050. {12.3, 
Cross-Chapter Box 8 in this chapter} 
Despite limited current deployment, moderate to large future 
mitigation potentials are estimated for direct air carbon 
capture and sequestration (DACCS), enhanced weathering 
(EW) and ocean-based CDR methods (including ocean alkalinity 
enhancement and ocean  fertilisation) (medium evidence, 
medium agreement). The potential for DACCS (5–40 GtCO 2 yr–1) 
is limited mainly by requirements for low-carbon energy and by cost 
(USD100–300 (full range: USD84–386) tCO 2–1). DACCS is currently 
at a  medium technology readiness level. EW has the potential to 
remove 2–4 (full range: <1 to about 100) GtCO 2 yr–1, at costs ranging 
from USD50 to 200 (full range: USD24–578) tCO 2–1.  Ocean-based 
methods have a combined potential to remove 1–100 GtCO 2 yr–1 at 
costs of USD40–500 tCO 2–1, but their feasibility is uncertain due to 
possible side effects on the marine environment. EW and ocean-based 
methods are currently at a low technology readiness level. {12.3}
Realising the full mitigation potential from the food system 
requires change at all stages from producer to consumer 
and waste management, which can be facilitated through 
integrated policy packages (robust evidence, high agreement). 
Some 23–42% of global GHG emissions are associated with 
food systems, while there is still widespread food insecurity and 
malnutrition. Absolute GHG emissions from food systems increased 
from 14 to 17 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 in the period 1990–2018. Both supply and demand-side measures are important to reduce the GHG 
intensity of food systems. Integrated food policy packages based 
on a combination of market-based, administrative, informative, and 
behavioural policies  can reduce cost compared to uncoordinated 
interventions, address multiple sustainability goals, and increase 
acceptance across stakeholders and civil society (limited evidence, 
medium agreement). {7.2, 7.4, 12.4}
Diets high in plant protein and low in meat and dairy are 
associated with lower GHG emissions (robust evidence, high 
agreement). Ruminant meat shows the highest GHG intensity. Beef 
from dairy systems has lower emissions intensity than beef from beef 
herds (8–23 and 17–94  kgCO 2-eq per 100 g  protein, respectively) 
when a share of emissions is allocated to dairy products. The wide 
variation in emissions reflects differences in production systems, 
which range from intensive feedlots with stock raised largely on 
grains through to rangeland and transhumance production systems. 
Where appropriate, a  shift to diets with a  higher share of plant 
protein, moderate intake of animal-source foods and reduced intake 
of added sugars, salt and saturated fats could lead to substantial 
decreases in GHG emissions. Benefits would also include reduced 
land occupation and nutrient losses to the surrounding environment, 
while at the same time providing health benefits and reducing 
mortality from diet-related non-communicable diseases. {7.4.5, 12.4}
Emerging food technologies such as cellular fermentation, 
cultured meat, plant-based alternatives to animal-based 
food products, and controlled-environment agriculture, can 
bring substantial reductions in direct GHG emissions from 
food production (limited evidence, high agreement). These 
technologies have lower land, water, and nutrient footprints, and 
address concerns over animal welfare. Access to low-carbon energy 
is needed to realise the full mitigation potential, as some emerging 
technologies are relatively more energy intensive. This also holds for 
deployment of cold chain and packaging technologies, which can help 
reduce food loss and waste, but increase energy and materials use in 
the food system. (limited evidence, high agreement). {11.4.1.3, 12.4}
Scenarios that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower by 2100 
commonly involve extensive mitigation in the agriculture, 
forestry and other land use (AFOLU) sector that at the 
same time provides biomass for mitigation in other sectors. 
Bioenergy is the most land intensive renewable energy option, 
but the total land occupation of other renewable energy 
options can become significant in high deployment scenarios 
(robust evidence, high agreement). Growing demands for food, 
feed, biomaterials, and non-fossil fuels increase the competition for 
land and biomass while climate change creates additional stresses on 
land, exacerbating existing risks to livelihoods, biodiversity, human 
and ecosystem health, infrastructure, and food systems. Appropriate 
integration of bioenergy and other bio-based systems, and of other 
mitigation options, with existing land and biomass uses can improve 
resource use efficiency, mitigate pressures on natural ecosystems and 
support adaptation through measures to combat land degradation, 
enhance food security, and improve resilience through maintenance 
of the productivity of the land resource base (medium evidence, high 
agreement). {3.2.5, 3.4.6, 12.5}  
Chapter 12 Cross-sectoral Perspectives12Bio-based products as part of a  circular bioeconomy have 
potential to support adaptation and mitigation. Key to 
maximising benefits and managing trade-offs are sectoral 
integration, transparent governance, and stakeholder 
involvement (high confidence). A sustainable bioeconomy relying 
on biomass resources will need to be supported by technology 
innovation and international cooperation and governance of global 
trade to disincentivise environmental and social externalities (medium 
confidence). {12.5, Cross-Working Group Box 3 in this chapter}
Coordinated, cross-sectoral approaches to climate change 
mitigation should be adopted to target synergies and minimise 
trade-offs between sectors and with respect to sustainable 
development (robust evidence, high agreement). This requires 
integrated planning using multiple-objective-multiple-impact policy 
frameworks. Strong interdependencies and cross-sectoral linkages 
create both opportunities for synergies and the need to address 
trade-offs related to mitigation options and technologies. This can 
only be done if coordinated sectoral approaches to climate change 
mitigation policies that mainstream these interactions are adopted. 
Integrated planning and cross-sectoral alignment of climate change 
policies are particularly evident in developing countries’ Nationally 
Determined Contributions (NDCs) pledged under the Paris Agreement, 
where key priority sectors such as agriculture and energy are closely 
aligned between the proposed mitigation and adaptation actions 
in the context of sustainable development and the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs). {12.6.2}
Carbon leakage is a critical cross-sectoral and cross-country 
consequence of differentiated climate policy (robust 
evidence, medium agreement). Carbon leakage occurs when 
mitigation measures implemented in one country/sector lead to 
increased emissions in other countries/sectors. Global commodity 
value chains and associated international transport are important 
mechanisms of carbon leakage. Reducing emissions from the value 
chain and transportation can offer opportunities to mitigate three 
elements of cross-sectoral spillovers and related leakage: (i) domestic 
cross-sectoral spillovers within the same country; (ii) international 
spillovers within a  single sector resulting from substitution of 
domestic production of carbon-intensive goods with their imports 
from abroad; and (iii) international cross-sectoral spillovers among 
sectors in different countries. {12.6.3}
Cross-sectoral considerations in mitigation finance are critical 
for the effectiveness of mitigation action as well as for balancing 
the often conflicting social, developmental, and environmental 
policy goals at the sectoral level (medium evidence, medium 
agreement). True resource mobilisation plans that properly address 
mitigation costs and benefits at sectoral level cannot be developed 
in isolation from their cross-sectoral implications. There is an urgent 
need for multilateral financing institutions to align their frameworks 
and delivery mechanisms including the use of blended financing to 
facilitate cross-sectoral solutions as opposed to causing competition 
for resources among sectors. {12.6.4}Understanding the co-benefits and trade-offs associated with 
mitigation is key to supporting societies to prioritise among 
the various sectoral policy options (medium evidence, medium 
agreement). For example, CDR options can have positive impacts 
on ecosystem services and the SDGs, but also potential adverse 
side effects; transforming food systems has potential co-benefits for 
several SDGs, but also trade-offs; and land-based mitigation measures 
may have multiple co-benefits but may also be associated with trade-
offs among environmental, social, and economic objectives. Therefore, 
the possible implementation of the different sectoral mitigation 
options would depend on how societies prioritise mitigation versus 
other products and services, including food, material well-being, 
nature conservation and biodiversity protection, as well as on other 
considerations such as society’s future dependence on CDR and on 
carbon-based energy and materials. {12.3, 12.4, 12.5, 12.6.1}
Governance of CDR, food systems and land-based mitigation 
can support effective and equitable policy implementation 
(medium evidence, high agreement). Effectively responding 
to climate change while advancing sustainable development will 
require coordinated efforts among a diverse set of state- and non-
state-actors on global, multinational, national, and sub-national 
levels. Governance arrangements in public policy domains that cut 
through traditional sectors are confronted with specific challenges, 
such as establishing reliable systems for monitoring, reporting and 
verification (MRV) that allow evaluation of mitigation outcomes 
and co-benefits. Effectively integrating CDR into mitigation 
portfolios can build on already existing rules, procedures and 
instruments for emissions abatement. Additionally, to accelerate 
research, development, and demonstration, and to incentivise CDR 
deployment, a  political commitment to formal integration into 
existing climate policy frameworks is required, including reliable 
MRV of carbon flows. Food systems governance may be pioneered 
through local food policy initiatives complemented by national 
and international initiatives, but governance on the national level 
tends to be fragmented, and thus have limited capacity to address 
structural issues like inequities in access. The governance of land-
based mitigation, including land-based CDR, can draw on lessons 
from previous experience with regulating biofuels and forest carbon; 
however, integrating these insights requires governance that goes 
beyond project-level approaches and emphasises integrated land 
use-planning and management within the frame of the SDGs. {7.4,

Cross-sectoral Perspectives  Chapter 121212.1 Introduction
12.1.1 Chapter Overview
The scope of this chapter was motivated by the need for a succinct 
bottom-up cross-sectoral view of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
mitigation coupled with the desire to provide systemic perspectives 
on critical mitigation potentials and options that go beyond individual 
sectors and cover cross-sectoral topics such as food systems, land 
systems, and carbon dioxide removal (CDR) methods. Driven by this 
motivation, Chapter 12 provides a focused thematic assessment of 
CDR methods and food systems, followed by consideration of land-
related impacts of mitigation options (land-based CDR and other 
mitigation options that occupy land) and other cross-sectoral impacts 
of mitigation, with emphasis on synergies and trade-offs between 
mitigation options, and between mitigation and other environmental 
and socio-economic objectives. The systems focus is unique to 
the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the IPCC and is of critical 
policy relevance as it informs coordinated approaches to planning 
interventions that deliver multiple benefits and minimise trade-
offs, and coordinated policy approaches to support such planning, 
to tap relatively under-explored areas for the strengthening and  
acceleration of mitigation efforts in the short to medium term, 
and for dealing with residual emissions in hard-to-transition sectors 
in the medium to long term.
Table 12.1 presents an overview of the cross-sectoral perspectives 
addressed in Chapter 12, mapping the chapter’s main themes to the 
sectoral and global chapters in this report. These mappings reflect 
the cross-sectoral aspects of mitigation options in the context of 
sustainable development, sectoral policy interactions, governance, 
implications in terms of international trade, spillover effects, and 
competitiveness, and cross-sectoral financing options for mitigation. 
While some cross-sector technologies are covered in more detail 
in sectoral chapters,  this chapter covers  important cross-sectoral 
linkages and provides synthesis concerning  costs and potentials 
of mitigation  options, and co-benefits and trade-offs that can be 
associated with deployment of mitigation options. Additionally, 
Chapter 12 covers CDR methods and specific considerations related 
to land use and food systems, complementing Chapter  7.  The 
literature assessed in the chapter includes both peer-reviewed and 
grey literature since the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the IPCC, 
including the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C 
(SR1.5), the IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land 
(SRCCL) and the IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere 
in a Changing Climate (SROCC). Knowledge gaps are identified and 
reflected where encountered, as well as in a separate section. Finally, 
a strong link is maintained with sectoral chapters and the relevant 
global chapters of this report to ensure consistency.
12.1.2 Chapter Content
Chapters  5  to 11 assess outcomes from mitigation measures that 
are applicable in individual sectors, and potential co-benefits and 
adverse side effects of these individual measures. Chapter 12 brings 
together the cross-sectoral aspects of these assessments including synergies and trade-offs as well as the implications of measures that 
have application in more than one sector and measures 
whose  implementation in one sector impacts implementation in 
other sectors.
Taking stock of the sectoral mitigation assessments, Chapter  12 
provides a  summary synthesis of sectoral mitigation costs and 
potentials in the short and long term along with comparison to the 
top-down integrated assessment model (IAM) assessment literature 
of Chapter  3  and the national/regional assessment  literature of 
Chapter 4.
In the context of cross-sectoral synergies and trade-offs, the chapter 
identifies a number of mitigation measures that have application in 
more than one sector. Examples include measures involving product 
and material circularity, which contribute to mitigation of  GHG 
emissions in a number of ways, such as treatment of organic waste 
to reduce methane emissions, avoid emissions through generation 
of renewable energy, and reduce emissions through substitution of 
synthetic fertilisers. Low-carbon energy technologies such as solar 
and wind may be used for grid electricity supply, as embedded 
generation in the buildings sector (e.g., rooftop solar) and for energy 
supply in the agriculture sector. Nuclear and bio-based thermal 
electric generation can provide multiple synergies including base 
load to augment solar and wind, district heating, and seawater 
desalination. Grid-integrated hydrogen systems can buffer variability 
of solar and wind power and are being explored as a  mitigation 
option in the transport and industry sectors. Carbon capture and 
storage (CCS) has potential application in a  number of industrial 
processes (cement, iron and steel, petroleum refining and pulp and 
paper) and the fossil fuel electricity sector. When coupled with energy 
recovery from biomass (BECCS), CCS can help to provide CO 2 removal 
from the atmosphere. On the demand side, electric vehicles are also 
considered an option for balancing variable power, energy efficiency 
options find application across the sectors, as does reducing demand 
for goods and services, and improving material use efficiency. Focused 
inquiry into these areas of cross-sectoral perspectives is provided for 
CDR, food systems, and land-based mitigation options.
A range of examples of where mitigation measures result in cross-
sectoral interactions and integration is identified. The mitigation 
potential of electric vehicles, including plug-in hybrids, is linked to 
the extent of decarbonisation of the electricity grid, as well as to the 
liquid fuel supply emissions profile. Making buildings energy positive, 
where excess energy is used to charge vehicles, can increase the 
potential of electric and hybrid vehicles. Advanced process control 
and process optimisation in industry can reduce energy demand 
and material inputs, which in turn can reduce emissions linked to 
resource extraction and manufacturing. Trees and green roofs 
planted to counter urban heat islands reduce the demand for energy 
for air conditioning and simultaneously sequester carbon. Material 
and product circularity contributes to mitigation, such as treatment 
of organic waste to reduce methane emissions, generate renewable 
energy, and to substitute for synthetic fertilisers.
The chapter also discusses cross-sectoral mitigation potential related to 
diffusion of general-purpose technologies (GPT), such as electrification, 
Chapter 12 Cross-sectoral Perspectives12digitalisation, and hydrogen. Examples include the use of hydrogen as 
an energy carrier, which, when coupled with low-carbon energy, has 
potential for driving mitigation in energy, industry, transport, and 
buildings (Box 12.5), and digitalisation has the potential for reducing 
GHG emissions through energy savings across multiple sectors.
The efficient realisation of the above examples of cross-sectoral 
mitigation would require careful design of government interventions 
across planning, policy, finance, governance, and capacity 
building  fronts. In this respect, Chapter  12 assesses literature on 
cross-sectoral integrated policies, cross-sectoral financing solutions, 
cross-sectoral spillovers and competitiveness effects, and on cross-
sectoral governance for climate change mitigation.
Finally, in the context of cross-sectoral synergies and trade-offs, the 
chapter assesses the non-climate mitigation co-benefits and adverse 
effects in relation to SDGs, building on the fast-growing literature on 
the non-climate impacts of mitigation.
12.1.3 Chapter Layout
The chapter is mapped into seven sections. Cost and potentials 
of mitigation technologies are discussed in Section  12.2, where 
a  comparative assessment and a  summary of sectoral mitigation 
cost and potentials is provided in coordination with the sectoral 
Chapters 5 to 11, along with a comparison to aggregate cost and 
potentials based on IAM outputs presented in Chapter 3.
Section  12.3 provides a  synthesis of the state and potential 
contribution of CDR methods for addressing climate change. CDR 
options associated with the agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) and energy sectors are dealt with in Chapters 6 and 7 and 
synthesised in Section 12.3. Other methods, not dealt with elsewhere, 
are covered in more detail. A comparative assessment is provided for 
the different CDR options in terms of costs, potentials, governance, 
impacts and risks, and synergies and trade-offs.
Section  12.4 assesses the literature on food systems and GHG 
emissions. The term ‘food system’ refers to a composite of elements 
(environment, people, inputs, processes, infrastructures, institutions, 
etc.) and activities that relate to the production, processing, 
distribution, preparation and consumption of food, and the outputs 
of these activities, including socio-economic and environmental 
outcomes. Climate change mitigation opportunities and related 
implications for sustainable development and adaptation are 
assessed, including those arising from food production, landscape 
impacts, supply chain and distribution, and diet shifts.
Section 12.5 provides a cross-sectoral perspective on land occupation 
and related impacts, risks and opportunities associated with land-
based mitigation options as well as mitigation options that are not 
designated land based, yet occupy land. It builds on SRCCL and 
Chapter 7 in this report, which covers mitigation in AFOLU, including 
biomass production for mitigation in other sectors. In addition to an 
assessment of biophysical and socio-economic risks, impacts and 
opportunities, this section includes a Cross-Working Group Box (WGII 
and WGIII) on Mitigation and Adaptation via the Bioeconomy, and 
a Box on Land Degradation Neutrality as a framework to manage 
trade-offs in land-based mitigation.
Section  12.6 provides a  cross-sectoral perspective on mitigation, 
co-benefits, and trade-offs, including those related to sustainable 
development and adaptation. The synthesised sectoral mitigation

Cross-sectoral Perspectives  Chapter 1212synergies and trade-offs are mapped into options/technologies, 
policies, international trade, and finance domains. Cross-sectoral 
mitigation technologies fall into three categories in which the 
implementation of the technology: (i) occurs in parallel in more than 
one sector; (ii) could involve interaction between sectors, and/or 
(iii) could create resource competition among sectors. Policies that 
have direct sectoral effects include specific policies for reducing 
GHG emissions and non-climate policies that yield GHG emissions 
reductions as co-benefits. Policies may also have indirect cross-
sectoral effects, including synergies and trade-offs that may, in 
addition, spill over to other countries.
Section 12.7 provides an overview of knowledge gaps, which could 
be used to inform further research.
12.2 Aggregation of Sectoral 
Costs and Potentials
The aim of this section is to provide a consolidated overview of the 
net emissions reduction potentials and costs for mitigation options 
available in the various sectors dealt with in the sectoral Chapters 6, 
7, 9, 10 and 11 of this assessment report. This overview provides 
policymakers with an understanding of which options are more or 
less important in terms of mitigating emissions in the short term 
(here interpreted as 2030), and which ones are more or less costly. 
The intention is not to provide a  high level of accuracy for each 
technology cost or potential, but rather to indicate relative importance 
on a global scale and whether costs are low, intermediate or high. 
The section starts with an introduction (Section  12.2.1), providing 
definitions and the background. Next, ranges of net emission 
reduction potentials and the associated costs for the year 2030 are 
presented (Section  12.2.2) and compared to earlier estimates and 
with the outputs of IAMs (Section 12.2.3). Finally, an outlook to the 
year 2050 is provided (Section 12.2.4).
12.2.1 Introduction
The term ‘mitigation potential’ is used here to report the quantity of 
net greenhouse gas emissions reductions that can be achieved by 
a given mitigation option relative to a specified reference scenario. 
The net greenhouse gas emission reduction is the sum of reduced 
emissions and enhanced sinks. Several types of potential can be 
distinguished. The technical potential is the mitigation potential 
constrained by theoretical limits in addition to the availability of 
technology and practices. Quantification of technical potentials 
primarily takes into account technical considerations, but social, 
economic and/or environmental considerations are sometimes also 
considered, if these represent strong barriers to the deployment of 
an option. The economic potential, being the potential reported in 
this section, is the proportion of the technical potential for which the 
social benefits exceed the social costs, taking into account a social 
discount rate and the value of externalities (see Annex I: Glossary). 
In this section, only externalities related to greenhouse gas emissions 
are taken into account. They are represented by using different cost 
cut-off levels of options in terms of USD per tonne of avoided CO 2-eq emissions. Other potentials, such as market potentials, could also be 
considered, but they are not included in this section.
The analysis presented here is based, as far as possible, on 
information contained in Chapters 6, 7, 9, 10 and 11, where costs 
and potentials, referred to here as ‘sectoral mitigation potentials’ 
have been discussed for each individual sector. In the past, these 
were designated as bottom-up potentials, in contrast to the top-
down potentials that are obtained from integrated energy-economic 
models and IAMs. However, IAMs increasingly include ‘bottom-up’ 
elements, which makes the distinction less clear. Still, sectoral studies 
often have more technical and economic detail than IAMs. They may 
also provide more up-to-date information on technology options 
and associated costs. However, aggregation of results from sectoral 
studies is more complex, and although interactions and overlap are 
corrected for as far as possible in this analysis, it is recognised that 
such systemic effects are much more rigorously taken into account 
in IAMs. A comparison is made between the sectoral results and the 
outcomes of the IAMs in Section 12.2.3.
Costs of mitigation options will change over time. For many 
technologies, costs will reduce as a result of technological learning. 
An attempt has been made to take into account the average, 
implementation-weighted costs until 2030. However, the underlying 
literature did not always allow such costs to be presented. For the year 
2030, the results are presented similarly to AR4, with a breakdown 
of the potential in ‘cost bins’. For the year 2050, a more qualitative 
approach is provided. The origins of the cost data in this section are 
mostly based on studies carried out in the period 2015–2020. Given 
the wide range of the cost bins that are used in this section it is 
not meaningful (and often not possible) to convert to USD values for 
one specific year. This may lead to some extra uncertainty, but this is 
expected to be relatively small.
As indicated previously, net emission reduction potentials are 
presented based on comparison with a  reference scenario. 
Unfortunately, not all costs and potentials found in the literature are 
determined against the same reference scenarios. In this assessment, 
reference scenarios are based on what were assumed current-policy 
scenarios in the period 2015–2019. Typical reference scenarios are the 
Shared Socio-economic Pathway (SSP2) scenarios (Fricko et al. 2017) 
and the Current Policies scenario from the World Energy Outlook 
(WEO) 2019 (IEA 2019). They can both be considered scenarios with 
middle-of-the-road expectations on population growth and economic 
development, but there are still some differences between the two 
(Table  12.2). The net emissions reduction potentials reported here 
were generally based on analyses carried out before 2020, so the 
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was not taken into account. For 
comparison, the Stated Policies scenario of the World Energy Outlook 

impact of COVID-19 was considered. Variations of up to 10% between 
the different reference scenarios exist with respect to macro-variables 
such as total primary energy use and total GHG emissions. The 
potential estimates presented below should be interpreted against 
this background. The total emissions under the reference scenarios in 

a median of 60 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 (Table 4.1).
Chapter 12 Cross-sectoral Perspectives12For the energy sector the potentials are determined using the World 
Energy Outlook 2019 Current Policies Scenario as a reference (IEA 
2019). However, for the economic assessment, more recent Levelised 
Costs of Electricity (LCOEs) for different electricity generating 
technologies were used (IEA 2020a). For the AFOLU sector, the 
potentials were derived from a variety of studies. It may be expected 
that the best estimates, as averages, match with the reference in 
a middle-of-the-road scenario. For the buildings sector, the Current 
Policies scenario of World Energy Outlook 2019 (IEA 2019) was 
used as a reference. For the transport sector, the references of the 
underlying sources were used. For the industry sector, the scenarios 
used have emissions that are slightly higher than in the Current 
Policies scenario from the World Energy Outlook 2019 (IEA 2019).
12.2.2 Costs and Potentials of Options for 2030
In this section, we present an overview of mitigation options per 
sector. An overview of net emissions reduction potentials for different 
mitigation options is presented in Table 12.3.
Firstly, a brief overview of the process of data collection is presented, 
with a  more detailed overview being found in Supplementary 
Material 12.SM.1.2. For the energy sector, the starting point for 
the determination of the emissions reduction potentials was the 
Emissions Gap Report (UNEP 2017), but new literature was also 
assessed, and a  few studies that provide updated estimates of 
the mitigation potentials were included. It was found that higher 
mitigation potentials than in the UNEP report are now reported for 
solar and wind energy, but at the same time electricity production by solar and wind energy in the reference scenario has increased, 
compared to earlier versions of the World Energy Outlook. The net 
effect is a  modest increase in the average value of the potential, 
and a  wider uncertainty range. Costs of electricity-generating 
technologies are discussed in Section 6.4.7, with a summary of LCOEs 
from the literature being presented in Section 6.4.7. Mitigation costs 
of electricity production technology depend on local conditions 
and on the baseline technology being displaced, and it is difficult 
to determine the distribution over the cost ranges used in this 
assessment. However, it is possible to indicate a broad cost range for 
these technologies. These cost ranges are presented in Table 12.3. For 
onshore wind and utility-scale solar energy, there is strong evidence 
that despite regional differences in resource potential and cost, 
a large part of the mitigation potential can be found in the negative 
cost category or at cost parity with fossil fuel-based options. This is 
also the case for nuclear energy in some regions. Other technologies 
show mostly positive mitigation costs, the highest mitigation costs 
are for CCS and bioelectricity with CCS, for details see Supplementary 
Material 12.SM.1.2.
For the AFOLU sector, assessments of global net emissions reduction 
studies were provided in Table 7.3. The number of studies depends 
on the type of mitigation action, but ranges from five to nine. Each 
of these studies relies on a much larger number of underlying data 
sources. From these studies, emissions reduction ranges and best 
estimates were derived. The studies presented refer to different years 
in the period 2020 to 2050, and the mitigation potential presented 
for AFOLU primarily refers to the average over the period 2020 to 
2050. However, because most of the activities involve storage of 
carbon in stocks that accumulate carbon, or conversely decay over Table 12.2 | Key characteristics of the scenarios used as a reference for determining costs and potentials.  The values are for the year 2030.

a The difference between WEO-2020 and WEO-2019 is partly explained by the fact that WEO-2019 had two different reference scenarios: Current Policies and Stated Policies. 
WEO-2020 has only one reference: the Stated Policies Scenario, which ‘is based on today’s policy settings’. The Stated Policies Scenario in WEO-2019 had energy-related 
emissions of 34.9 GtCO 2. EJ, exajoules (1 x 1018 joules); p.a., per annum.
Cross-sectoral Perspectives  Chapter 1212time (e.g., forests, mangroves, peatland soils, agricultural soils, wood 
products), the 2020 to 2050 average provides a good approximation 
of the amount of permanent atmospheric CO 2 mitigation that 
could be available at a given price in 2030. The exception is BECCS, 
which is in an early upscaling phase, so the potential estimated by 
Chapter 7 as an average for the 2020 to 2050 period is not included 
in Table 12.3. Note that for the energy sector a mitigation potential 
for BECCS is provided in Table 12.3.
The emissions reduction potentials for the buildings sector were 
based on the analysis by Chapter  9  authors of a  large number of 
sectoral studies for individual countries or regions. In total, the 
chapter analysed the results of 67 studies that assess the potential 
of technological energy efficiency and onsite renewable energy 
production and use, and the results of 11 studies that assess the 
potential of sufficiency measures helping avoid demand for energy 
and materials. The sufficiency measures were included in models by 
reorganisation of human activities; efficient design, planning, and 
use of building space; higher density of building and settlement 
inhabitancy; redefining and downsizing goods and equipment, 
limiting their use to health, living, and working standards, and their 
sharing. Most of these studies targeted 2050 for the decarbonisation 
of buildings; the potentials in 2030 reported here rely on the 
estimates for 2030 provided by these studies or on the interpolated 
estimates targeting these 2050 figures. Based on these individual 
country studies, regional aggregate emissions reduction percentages 
were found. The potential estimates were assembled in the order 
sufficiency, efficiency, renewable options, correcting the amount 
of the potential at each step for the interaction with preceding 
measures. Note that the option ‘Enhanced use of wood products’ 
was analysed by Chapter 7, but is listed under the buildings sector in 
Table 12.3, as such enhanced use of wood takes place predominantly 
in the construction sector.
For the transport sector, Chapter 10 provided data on the emissions 
reduction potential for shipping. For the other transportation modes, 
additional sources were used to achieve a  complete overview of 
emissions reduction potentials (for further details, see Supplementary 
Material 12.SM.1.2). A  limited number of estimates for global 
emissions reduction potential is available: the total number of 
sources is about 10, and some estimates rely on just one source. The 
data have been coordinated with Chapter 10 authors.
For the industrial sector, global emissions reduction potentials per 
technology class per sector were derived by Chapter  11 authors, 
using primarily sectoral or technology-oriented literature. The 
analysis is based on about 75 studies, including sectoral assessments 
(Sections 11.4.1 and 11.4.2 and Figure 11.13).
For methane emissions reduction from oil and gas operations, coal 
mining, waste treatment and wastewater, an analysis was done, 
based on three major data sources in this area (Harmsen et al. 
2019; US EPA 2019; Höglund-Isaksson et al. 2020); for oil and gas 
operations this was complemented by IEA (2021a). A similar analysis 
for reductions of emissions of fluorinated gases was carried out based 
on analysis by the same institutes (Purohit and Höglund-Isaksson 
2017; Harmsen et al. 2019; US EPA 2019). Data for CDR options not discussed previously (such as DACCS and enhanced weathering) 
were taken from Section 12.3. For more details about data sources 
and data processing, see Supplementary Material 12.SM.1.2.
In Table  12.4 mitigation potentials for all gases are presented 
in  GtCO 2-eq. For most sectors the mitigation potentials (notably 
for methane emissions reductions from coal, oil and gas, waste and 
wastewater) have been converted to CO 2-eq using global warming 
potential (GWP) values as presented in AR6 WGIII (Cross-Chapter 
Box 2 in Chapter 2). However, the underlying literature did not always 
accommodate this, in which cases older GWP values apply. Given 
the uncertainty ranges in the mitigation potentials in Table 12.3, the 
impact on the results of using different GWP values is considered 
to be very small.
For all options, uncertainty ranges of the mitigation potentials are 
given in Table  12.3. As far as possible, the ranges represent the 
variation in assessments found in the literature. This is the case 
for wind and solar energy, for the AFOLU options, for the methane 
mitigation options (coal, oil and gas, waste and wastewater) and for 
fluorinated gas mitigation. For the latter options, some variability 
exists for each cost bin, but aggregated over cost ranges the variation 
is much smaller, typically ±50%. For the buildings sector and the 
industrial sector options, the uncertainty in the mitigation potential 
is estimated by the lead authors of those chapters. For options for 
which only limited sources were available, an uncertainty range of 
±50% was used. Overall, the uncertainty range per option is typically 
in the range of ±20% to ±60%.
Despite these uncertainties, clearly a number of options with high 
potentials can be identified, including solar energy, wind energy, 
reducing conversion of forests and other natural ecosystems, and 
restoration of forests and other natural ecosystems. As mid-range 
values, they each represent 4 to 7% of total reference emissions for 
2030. Soil carbon sequestration in agriculture and fuel switching 
in industry can also be considered as options with high potential, 
although it should be noted that these options consist of a number 
of discernible sub-options, see Table  12.3. It can be observed that 
for each sector, a variety of options is available. Many of the smaller 
options each make up 1 to 2% of the reference emissions for 2030. 
Within this group of smaller options there are some categories that, 
summed together, stand out as substantial: the energy efficiency 
options and the methane mitigations options.
Costs are highly variable across the options. All sectors have several 
options for which at least part of the potential has mitigation costs 
below USD20 tCO 2–1. The only exception is the industrial sector, in 
which only energy efficiency is available below this cost level. At the 
same time, a  substantial part of the emissions reduction potential 
comes at higher cost, much being in the USD20 to 100 tCO 2–1 cost 
ranges. All sectors have substantial additional potential in these 
cost ranges; only for transportation is this limited. Aggregation 
of the potentials per cost bin shows that the potential in these 
cost bins is marginally smaller than in the two cheapest cost 
bins. For  some options, potential was identified in the 100 to 

range make up only a small part of the total mitigation potential.  
Chapter 12 Cross-sectoral Perspectives12Table 12.3 | Detailed overview of global net GHG emissions reduction potentials (GtCO 2-eq) in the various cost categories for the year 2030.  Note that 
potentials within and across sectors cannot be summed, as the adoption of some options may affect the mitigation potentials of other options. Only monetary costs and 
benefits of options are taken into account. Negative costs occur when the benefits are higher than the costs. For wind energy, for example, this is the case if production costs 
are lower than those of the fossil alternatives. Ranges are indicated for each option separately, or indicated for the sector as a whole (see Notes column); they reflect full ranges. 
Cost ranges are not cumulative, e.g., to obtain the full potential below USD50 tCO 2-eq–1, the potentials in the cost bins <USD0, USD0–20 and USD20–50 tCO 2-eq–1 need to 
be summed together.

Chapter 12 Cross-sectoral Perspectives12It could be that there is limited potential in this range; however, 
a  more plausible explanation, supported by several authors of 
sectoral chapters, is that this cost range is relatively unexplored.
In this assessment, the emphasis is on the specific mitigation costs of 
the various options, and these are often considered as an indicator 
to prioritise options. However, in such a prioritisation, other elements 
will also play a  role, like the development of technology for the 
longer term (Section 12.2.4) and the need to optimise investments 
over longer time periods, see for example Vogt-Schilb et al. (2018) 
who argue that sometimes it makes sense to start with implementing 
the most expensive option.
In this section, an overview of emissions mitigation options for the 
year 2030 was presented. The overview of the mitigation potential 
is based on a variety of approaches, relying on a large number of 
sources, and the number of sources varied strongly from sector to 
sector. The main conclusions from this section are: (i) there is a variety 
of options per sector, (ii) per sector the options combined show 
significant mitigation potential, (iii) there are a  few major options 
and a lot of smaller ones, and (iv) more than half of the potential 
comes at costs below USD20 tCO 2–1 (between sectors: medium to 
robust evidence, high agreement).12.2.3 Aggregation of Sectoral Results and 
Comparison with Earlier Analyses 
and Integrated Assessment Models
In this section, the mitigation potentials are aggregated per sector, 
and then to the global economy. These potentials, which are based 
on sectoral analysis, are then compared to the results from earlier 
assessments and the results from IAMs. Given the incompleteness 
of data on the mitigation potential at mitigation costs larger than 
USD100 tCO 2–1, the focus will be on options with mitigation costs 
below USD100 tCO 2–1.
As suggested previously, the overview presented in Table 12.3 should 
be interpreted with care, as the implementation of one option may 
affect the mitigation potential of another option. Most sectoral chapters 
have supplied mitigation potentials that were already adjusted for 
overlap and mutual influences (industry, buildings, AFOLU). For the 
energy sector, interactions between the options will occur, but parallel 
implementation of all the options seems to be possible; if all options 
at costs levels below USD100 tCO 2–1 were implemented, this would 
lead to an additional power generation with no direct CO 2 emissions 
of 41% of the total projected generation in 2030. This seems to be 
possible, but as higher penetrations are relatively unexplored, we Emissions reduction

much larger potentials are projected, see Section 12.3.1.Enhanced weathering very small
Cross-sectoral Perspectives  Chapter 1212apply a smaller uncertainty range at the high end. For the calculation 
of the aggregate potentials in the energy sector, error propagation 
rules were applied. For the transport sector, there will be interaction 
between the technical measures on the one hand and the modal shift 
measures on the other hand. Given the small mitigation contribution 
of the modal shift options, these interactions will be negligible. The 
resulting aggregate mitigation potentials and their uncertainty ranges 
per (sub)sector are given in Table 12.4 (columns indicated ‘AR6’). This 
overview confirms the large potentials per sector, even when taking 
the uncertainty ranges into account.
Calculating aggregated mitigation potentials for the global economy 
requires that interactions between sectors also need to be taken into 
account (Section  12.6). First of all, there may be overlap between 
the electricity supply sector and the electricity demand sectors: if the 
electricity sector is extensively decarbonised, the avoided emissions 
due to electricity efficiency measures and local electricity production 
will be significantly reduced. Therefore, this demand-side mitigation 
potential is only taken into account for 25% (reflecting the degree 
of further decarbonisation of the power sector) in the cross-sectoral 
aggregation. For the other demand sectors, this problem does not 
arise. The industry sector did not provide estimates for electricity 
efficiency improvement and in the transport sector the utilisation of 
electricity to date is very low. Electrification options may occur in all 
sectors, but this enhances the mitigation potential in combination with a  decreased carbon intensity of the power sector. For other 
energy sector options, such as methane emissions reduction from 
coal, oil and natural gas operations, the situation is more complex. 
The total emissions reduction potential for fossil fuels in the other 
sectors is high. Should this potential be realised, this would lead to 
a reduction of the potential reported here. However, reducing fossil 
fuel use also leads to a  reduction in the upstream CH 4 (methane) 
emissions, so in the case of reducing fossil fuel use, these upstream 
emissions will also be avoided, so no overestimate of the aggregate 
emissions reduction potential occurs.
The total potential, given these corrections for overlap, leads to 
a mid-range value for the total mitigation potential at costs below 
USD100 tCO 2-eq–1 of 38 GtCO 2-eq. Given the fact that it is not to 
be expected that mitigation potentials of the various sectors are 
mutually correlated, that is, it is not to be expected that mitigation 
potentials are all on the high side or all on the low side, the ranges 
are aggregated using error propagation rules, which leads to a range 
for the mitigation potential of 32 to 44 GtCO 2-eq.
Mitigation costs and potentials for 2030 have been presented 
previously, notably in AR4 Chapter 11 on Mitigation from a Cross-
sectoral Perspective (Barker et al. 2007) and the Emissions Gap 
Report (UNEP 2017). Note that AR5 did not provide emissions 
reduction potentials in this form. The aggregated potentials reported

Chapter 12 Cross-sectoral Perspectives12here are higher than those estimated in AR4. Note, however, that AR4 
suggested the potentials were underestimated by 10 to 15%, but 
a higher potential still remains in the current assessment. In a sector-
by-sector comparison, higher potentials than in AR4 can be observed 
especially for the energy sector and the forestry sector, and to a more 
limited extent for the industry sector and the transport sector. For 
the energy sector, the change can largely be explained by the higher 
estimates for wind and solar energy and the improved understanding 
of how to integrate high shares of intermittent renewable energy 
sources into power systems. For industry and transport, the higher 
potentials can be partly explained by the inclusion of more options, 
like recycling and material efficiency (for industry) and electric 
transportation and modal shifts for transport. For buildings, a lower potential can be observed compared to AR4, one reason is that the 

45% and 11% higher in AR4 than they were in AR6 (signalling a much 
quicker actual switch to electricity than was thought 15 to 20 years 
ago, among other reasons). The other reason for a difference is that 
the scenarios considered in AR4 had 25 to 30 years between their 
start year until the target year of 2030 and the scenarios reviewed 
in AR6 have only 10 to 15 years before 2030. The current retrofitting 
rates of existing buildings and penetration rates of nearly zero-
energy buildings do not allow for decarbonisation of the sector over 

potential than reported here for 2030 can still be realised in the 
timeframe up to 2050 (Section 9.6.2).

Figure 12.1 | Comparison of sectoral estimates for emissions reduction potential with the emissions reductions calculated using IAMs.  Emission reductions 
calculated using IAMs are given as box plots of global emissions reductions for each sector (dark blue and brown) at different global carbon cost levels (horizontal axis) for 
2030, based on all scenarios that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower (see Chapter 3) in the AR6 scenarios database (IIASA 2021). For IAMs, the cost levels correspond to the 
levels of the carbon price. Hinges in the dark blue box plots represent the interquartile ranges and whiskers extend to 5th and 95th percentiles while the hinges in the brown 
box plots describe the full range, and the middle point indicates the mean, not the median. In yellow, the estimates from the sectoral analysis are given. In all cases, only direct 
emissions reductions are presented, except for the light-blue boxes (for buildings), which include indirect emissions reductions. The light-blue boxes are only given for reasons of 
completeness. For buildings the dark-blue boxes should be compared with the yellow boxes. Light-blue and yellow boxes represent the full ranges of estimates. For IAMs, global 
carbon prices are applied, which are subject to significant uncertainty.
Cross-sectoral Perspectives  Chapter 1212Another global analysis was done by McKinsey (2009), which 
presents a  marginal abatement cost curve for 2030, suggesting 
a  total potential of 38  GtCO 2-eq (note that the reference for that 
study is 70 GtCO 2-eq, which is at the high end of the reference range 
used in this assessment).
The potentials reported here are comparable with UNEP (2017). Note 
that material for the energy sector from the UNEP report was partly 
reused in this analysis. Furthermore, some options for the transport 
sector (aviation and biofuels) were identical to the estimates in the 
UNEP report. The remaining mitigation potentials are all based on 
new – and much more extended – assessment. There are some notable 
changes. The AR6 mitigation potential for forestry is substantially 
larger. For buildings the potential is smaller, mainly related to the 
smaller mitigation potential for electric appliances than in the UNEP 
report. But overall, the estimates of the total mitigation potential are 
well aligned, which confirms there is substantial consistency across 
various emissions reduction estimates.
The results of the sectoral mitigation potentials are also compared 
with mitigation impacts as calculated by IAMs. To this end, 
cumulative sectoral potentials over cost ranges were determined, 
based on the information in Table  12.3. For options that are in 
various cost ranges, we assumed that they are evenly distributed 
over these cost ranges. The only exception is wind and solar energy, 
for which it is indicated that the majority of the mitigation potential 
is in the negative cost range. It was assumed that the fraction in the 
negative cost range was 60%; the remainder is evenly distributed 
over the other cost ranges. These cumulative potentials were 
compared with emissions reductions realised in IAMs at certain 
price levels for CO 2. Note that these price levels selected in IAMs 
are average price levels – not all IAMs use globally uniform carbon 
prices, so underlying these cost levels, there may be regional 
differentiation. Data were taken from the AR6 scenarios database. 
Note that, strictly speaking, not all models in the database are 
IAMs; in this analysis all models in the database were used, but the term IAMs is used as shorthand in the text that follows. All 
scenarios that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower are included 
for the comparison (i.e., the categories of scenarios C1 to C3 in 
Chapter 3). A comparison per sector is provided in Figure 12.1. It 
is important to note that two different things are compared in this 
figure: on the one hand emissions reduction potentials and on the 
other hand realisations of (part of) the potential within the context 
of a certain scenario. Having said that, a number of lessons can be 
learned from the comparison of both.
For the energy supply sector, the emissions reductions projected by 
the IAMs are for the higher cost levels comparable with the potentials 
found in the sectoral analysis. But at lower cost levels, the emissions 
reductions as projected by IAMs are smaller than for the sectoral 
analysis. This is likely due to the fact that high costs for solar energy 
and wind energy are assumed in IAM models (Krey et al. 2019; Shiraki 
and Sugiyama 2020). This is not surprising, as the scenario database 
comprises studies dating back to 2015. A more detailed comparison 
for the power sector is given in Figure 12.2. Both the sectoral analysis 
and the IAMs find that both solar and wind energy in particular show 
strong growth potential, although there is a continuing role for other 
low-carbon technologies, like nuclear energy and hydropower.
For the AFOLU sector, the sectoral studies provide net emissions 
reduction potentials comparable with projections from the IAMs at 
costs levels up to USD50 tCO 2-eq–1. However, beyond that level the 
mitigation potential found in the sectoral analysis is larger than in 
the IAMs. For agriculture, it can be explained by the fact that carbon 
sequestration options, like soil carbon, biochar and agroforestry, 
have little to no representation in IAMs. Similarly, for forestry and 
other land use-related options, the protection and restoration of 
other ecosystems than forests (peatland, coastal wetlands and 
savannas) are not represented in IAMs. Also note that some IAM 
baselines already have small carbon prices, which induce land-based 
mitigation, while in others, mitigation, particularly from reduced 
deforestation, is part of the storyline even without an implemented 
type

plots describe the full range.
Chapter 12 Cross-sectoral Perspectives12carbon price. Both of these effects dampen the mitigation potential 
available in the USD100 tCO 2-eq–1 carbon price scenario from IAMs. 
Furthermore, estimates of mitigation through forestry and other land 
use-related options from the AR6 IAM scenario database represent 
the net emissions from A/R and deforestation, thus are likely to be 
lower than the sectoral estimates of A/R potential expressed as 
gross removals.
For the buildings and transport sectors, the sectoral mitigation 
potentials are higher than those projected by the IAMs. The 
difference in the transport sector is particularly significant. One 
possible explanation is that options with negative costs are already 
included in the reference. In addition, some options, like avoiding 
demand for energy services in the building sector and model shift in 
transportation, are less well represented in IAMs.
For the industry sector, the sectoral emissions reduction potentials 
are somewhat higher than those reported on average by IAMs. The 
difference can well be explained by the fact that most IAMs do not 
include circularity options like material efficiency and recycling; 
these options together account for 1.5 GtCO 2-eq at costs levels from 
USD20 tCO 2-eq–1 onwards.
For mitigation of emissions of methane and fluorinated gases, the 
comparability between the sectoral results and IAMs is good.
Overall, it is concluded that there are differences between the 
sectoral analyses and the IAM outcomes, but most of the differences 
can be explained by the exclusion of specific options in most IAMs. 
This comparability confirms the reliability of the sectoral analysis of 
emissions reduction potential. It also demonstrates the added value 
of sectoral analyses of mitigation potentials: they can more rapidly 
adapt to changes in price levels of technologies and adopt new 
options for emissions mitigation.In this section, the information on individual options reported  in 
Section  12.2.2 to sectoral and economy-wide totals has been 
aggregated. It is concluded that, based on the sectoral analysis, the 
global mitigation potential is in the range of 32 to 44  GtCO 2-eq. 
This mitigation potential is substantially higher than that reported 
in AR4, but it is comparable to the more recent estimate by UNEP 
(2017). Differences exist with the results of IAMs, but most of these 
can be well explained. The conclusion that the global potential is in 
this range can be drawn with high agreement and robust evidence.
Given the median projection of the reference emissions of 

here is sufficient to bring down global emissions in the year 2030 
to a level of 16 to 28 GtCO 2-eq. Taking into account that there is 
a range in reference projections for 2030 of 54 to 68 GtCO 2-eq, the 
resulting emissions level shows a wider range: 12 to 31 GtCO 2-eq. 
This is about, or below half, the most recent (2019) emissions value 
of 59 ± 6.6 GtCO 2-eq (high confidence).
12.2.4 Sectoral Findings on Emission 
Pathways until 2050
As noted previously, a more qualitative approach is followed and less 
quantitative information is presented for 2050. The sectoral results are 
summarised in Table 12.5. In addition to the many technologies that 
already play a  role by 2030 (Table  12.3) additional technologies 
may be needed for deep decarbonisation, for example for managing 
power systems with high shares of intermittent renewable sources 
and for providing new fuels and associated infrastructure for sectors 
that are hard to decarbonise. New processes also play an important 
role, notably for industrial processes. In general, stronger sector 
coupling is needed, particularly increased integration of energy end 
use and supply sectors.

Cross-sectoral Perspectives  Chapter 121212.3 Carbon Dioxide Removal
Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) refers to a  cluster of technologies, 
practices, and approaches that remove and sequester carbon dioxide 
from the atmosphere and durably store the carbon in geological, 
terrestrial, or ocean reservoirs, or in products. Despite the common 
feature of removing carbon dioxide, CDR methods can be very 
different (Smith et al. 2017). There are proposed methods for removal 
of non-CO 2 greenhouse gases such as methane (Jackson et al. 2019; 
Jackson et al. 2021) but scarcity of literature on these methods 
prevents assessment here.
A number of CDR methods (e.g.,  afforestation/reforestation 
(A/R), bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), soil carbon sequestration (SCS), biochar, wetland/peatland 
restoration and coastal restoration) are dealt with elsewhere in 
this report (Chapters  6  and 7). These methods are synthesised 
in Section  12.3.2. Others, not dealt with elsewhere,  – direct air 
carbon capture and storage (DACCS), enhanced weathering (EW) of 
minerals and ocean-based approaches including ocean fertilisation 
(OF) and ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) – are discussed in 
Sections  12.3.1.1 to 12.3.1.3 below (see also IPCC 2019b and 
AR6 WGI, Section 5.6). Some methods, such as BECCS and DACCS, 
involve carbon storage in geological formations, which is discussed 
in Chapter 6. The climate system and the carbon cycle responses to 
CDR deployment and each method’s physical and biogeochemical 
characteristics such as storage form and duration are assessed in 
Chapters 4 and 5 of the AR6 WGI report.

Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is a necessary element of mitigation portfolios to achieve net zero CO 2 and GHG emissions both globally 
and nationally, counterbalancing residual emissions from hard-to-transition sectors such as industry, transport and agriculture. CDR 
is a key element in scenarios that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower, regardless of whether global emissions reach near-zero, net 
zero or net-negative levels (Sections 3.3, 3.4, 3.5 and 12.3). While national mitigation portfolios aiming at net zero or net-negative 
emissions will need to include some level of CDR, the choice of methods and the scale and timing of their deployment will depend on 
the ambition for gross emissions reductions, how sustainability and feasibility constraints are managed, and how political preferences 
and social acceptability evolve (Section 12.3.3). This box gives an overview of CDR methods, presents a categorisation based on 
the key characteristics of removal processes and storage timescales, and clarifies the multiple roles of CDR in mitigation strategies. 
The term ‘negative emissions’ is used in this report only when referring to the net emissions outcome at a systems level (e.g., ‘net 
negative emissions’ at global, national, sectoral or supply chain levels).
Categorisation of the main CDR methods
CDR refers to anthropogenic activities that remove CO 2 from the atmosphere and store it durably in geological, terrestrial, or ocean 
reservoirs, or in products. It includes anthropogenic enhancement of biological, geochemical or chemical CO 2 sinks, but excludes 
natural CO 2 uptake not directly caused by human activities. Increases in land carbon sink strength due to CO 2 fertilisation or other 
indirect effects of human activities are not considered CDR (see Glossary). Carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon capture and 
utilisation (CCU) applied to CO 2 from fossil fuel use are not CDR methods as they do not remove CO 2 from the atmosphere. CCS and 
CCU can, however, be part of CDR methods if the CO 2 has been captured from the atmosphere, either indirectly in the form of biomass 
or directly from ambient air, and stored durably in geological reservoirs or products (Sections 11.3.6 and 12.3).
There are many different CDR methods and associated implementation options (Cross-Chapter Box  8, Figure  1). Some of these 
methods (including afforestation and improved forest management, wetland restoration and soil carbon sequestration (SCS)) have 
been practised for decades to millennia, although not necessarily with the intention of removing carbon from the atmosphere. 
Conversely, methods such as direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) 
and enhanced weathering are novel, and while experience is growing, their demonstration and deployment are limited in scale. CDR 
methods have been categorised in different ways in the literature, highlighting different characteristics. In this report, as in AR6 WGI, 
the categorisation is based on the role of CDR methods in the carbon cycle, that is, on the removal process (land-based biological; 
ocean-based biological; geochemical; chemical) and on the timescale of storage (decades to centuries; centuries to millennia; 
ten thousand years or longer). The time scale of storage is closely linked to the storage medium: carbon stored in ocean reservoirs 
(through enhanced weathering, ocean alkalinity enhancement or ocean fertilisation) and in geological formations (through BECCS or 
DACCS) generally has longer storage times and is less vulnerable to reversal through human actions or disturbances such as drought 
and wildfire than carbon stored in terrestrial reservoirs (vegetation, soil). Furthermore, carbon stored in vegetation or through SCS has 
Chapter 12 Cross-sectoral Perspectives12shorter storage times and is more vulnerable than carbon stored in buildings as wood products; as biochar in soils, cement and other 
materials; or in chemical products made from biomass or potentially through direct air (Fuss et al. 2018; Minx et al. 2018; NASEM 
2019) capture (Section 11.3.6; AR6 WGI, Figure 5.36). Within the same category (e.g., land-based biological CDR) options often differ 
with respect to other dynamic or context-specific dimensions, such as mitigation potential, cost, potential for co-benefits and adverse 
side effects, and technology readiness level (Table 12.6).
Roles of CDR in mitigation strategies
Within ambitious mitigation strategies at global or national levels, CDR cannot serve as a substitute for deep emissions reductions but 
can fulfil multiple complementary roles: it can (i) further reduce net CO 2 or GHG emission levels in the near-term; (ii) counterbalance 
residual emissions from hard-to-transition sectors, such as CO 2 from industrial activities and long-distance transport (e.g., aviation, 
shipping), or methane and nitrous oxide from agriculture, in order to help reach net zero CO 2 or GHG emissions in the mid-term; 
(iii) achieve and sustain net-negative CO 2 or GHG emissions in the long-term, by deploying CDR at levels exceeding annual residual 
gross CO 2 or GHG emissions (Sections 2.7.3 and 3.5).
In general, these roles of CDR are not mutually exclusive and can exist in parallel. For example, achieving net zero CO 2 or GHG 
emissions globally might involve some countries already reaching net-negative levels at the time of global net zero, allowing 
other countries more time to achieve this. Equally, achieving net-negative CO 2 emissions globally, which could address a potential 
temperature overshoot by lowering atmospheric CO 2 concentrations, does not necessarily involve all countries reaching net-negative 
levels (Rajamani et al. 2021; Rogelj et al. 2021) (Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 3).
Cross-Chapter Box 8, Figure 2 shows these multiple roles of CDR in a stylised ambitious mitigation pathway that can be applied to 
global and national levels. While such mitigation pathways will differ in their shape and exact composition, they include the same 
basic components: CO 2 emissions from fossil sources, CO 2 emissions from managed land, non-CO 2 emissions, and various forms of 
CDR. Cross-Chapter Box 8, Figure 2 also illustrates the importance of distinguishing between gross CO 2 removals from the atmosphere 
through deployment of CDR methods and the net emissions outcome (i.e., gross emissions minus gross removals).
CDR methods currently deployed on managed land, such as afforestation or reforestation and improved forest management, lead to CO 2 
removals already today, even when net emissions from land use are still positive, for example, when gross emissions from deforestation 
and draining peatlands exceed gross removals from afforestation or reforestation and ecosystem conservation (Sections 2.2 and 7.2; Cross-Chapter Box 8 (continued)
Cross-Chapter Box 8, Figure 1 | Carbon dioxide removal taxonomy. Methods are categorised based on removal process (grey shades) and 
storage medium (for which timescales of storage are given, yellow/brown shades). Main implementation options are included for each CDR method. 
Note that specific land-based implementation options can be associated with several CDR methods, for example, agroforestry can support soil carbon sequestration 
and provide biomass for biochar or BECCS. Source: adapted from Minx et al. (2018).
Cross-sectoral Perspectives  Chapter 1212Cross-Chapter Box  6  in Chapter  7). As there are currently no removal methods for non-CO 2 gases that have progressed beyond 
conceptual discussions (Jackson et al. 2021), achieving net zero GHG implies gross CO 2 removals to counterbalance residual emissions 
of both CO 2 and non-CO 2 gases, applying 100-year global warming potential (GWP100) as the metric for reporting CO 2-equivalent 
emissions, as required for emissions reporting under the Rulebook of the Paris Agreement (Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 2).
Net zero CO 2 emissions will be achieved earlier than net zero GHG emissions. As volumes of residual non-CO 2 emissions are expected 
to be significant, this time-lag could reach one to several decades, depending on the respective size and composition of residual GHG 
emissions at the time of net zero CO 2 emissions. Furthermore, counterbalancing residual non-CO 2 emissions by CO 2 removals will lead 
to net-negative CO 2 emissions at the time of net zero GHG emissions (Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 3).Cross-Chapter Box 8 (continued)

While many governments have included A/R and other forestry 
measures in their NDCs under the Paris Agreement (Moe and 
Røttereng 2018; Fyson and Jeffery 2019; Mace et al. 2021), and a few 
countries also mention BECCS, DACCS and enhanced weathering 
in their mid-century low emission development strategies (Buylova 
et al. 2021), very few are pursuing the integration of a broad range 
of CDR methods into national mitigation portfolios so far (Schenuit 
et al. 2021) (Box 12.1). There are concerns that the prospect of large-
scale CDR could, depending on the design of mitigation strategies, 
obstruct near-term emissions reduction efforts (Lenzi et al. 2018; 
Markusson et al. 2018), mask insufficient policy interventions (Geden 
2016; Carton 2019), might lead to an overreliance on technologies 
that are still in their infancy (Anderson and Peters 2016; Larkin et al. 
2018; Grant et al. 2021), could overburden future generations (Lenzi 
2018; Shue 2018; Bednar et al. 2019) might evoke new conflicts over 
equitable burden-sharing (Pozo et al. 2020; Lee et al. 2021; Mohan et al. 2021), could impact food security, biodiversity or land rights 
(Buck 2016; Boysen et al. 2017; Dooley and Kartha 2018; Hurlbert 
et al. 2019; Dooley et al. 2021), or might be perceived negatively 
by stakeholders and broader public audiences (Royal Society and 
Royal Academy of Engineering 2018; Colvin et al. 2020). Conversely, 
without considering different timescales of carbon storage (Fuss 
et al. 2018; Hepburn et al. 2019) and implementation of reliable 
measurement, reporting and verification of carbon flows (Mace et al. 
2021), CDR deployment might not deliver the intended benefit of 
removing CO 2 durably from the atmosphere. Furthermore, without 
appropriate incentive schemes and market designs (Honegger et al. 
2021b), CDR implementation options could see under-investment. 
The many challenges in research, development and demonstration 
of novel approaches, to advance innovation according to broader 
societal objectives and to bring down costs, could delay their scaling 
up and deployment (Nemet et al. 2018). Depending on the scale 
Chapter 12 Cross-sectoral Perspectives12
and deployment scenario, CDR methods could bring about various 
co-benefits and adverse side effects (see below). All this highlights the 
need for appropriate CDR governance and policies (Section 12.3.3).
The volumes of future global CDR deployment assumed in IAM-
based mitigation scenarios are large compared to current volumes of deployment, which presents a challenge since rapid and sustained 
upscaling from a small base is particularly difficult (de Coninck et al. 
2018; Nemet et al. 2018; Hanna et al. 2021). All Illustrative Mitigation

0.86 [0.01–4.11] GtCO 2 yr–1 by 2030, 2.98 [0.23–6.38] GtCO 2 yr–1 
by 2050, and 4.19 [0.1–6.91]  GtCO 2 yr–1 by 2100 (values are the 
medians and bracketed values denote the 5–95th percentile range1). 
The annual BECCS deployment is 0.08 [0–1.09]  GtCO 2 yr–1, 
2.75 [0.52–9.45] GtCO 2 yr–1, and 8.96 [2.63–16.15] GtCO 2 yr–1 for 
these years, respectively. The annual DACCS deployment eaches 

1.02 [0–12.6] GtCO 2 yr–1 by 2100 (Figure 12.3).2 Reported cumulative 
volumes of BECCS, CO 2 removal from AFOLU, and DACCS reach 

for the 2020–2100 period, respectively. Reaching the higher end 
of CDR volumes is subject to issues regarding their feasibility (see 
below), especially if achieved with only a  limited number of CDR 
methods. Recent studies have identified some drivers for large-
scale CDR deployment in IAM scenarios, including insufficient 
representation of variable renewables, a high discount rate that tends 
to increase initial carbon budget overshoot and therefore inflates 
usage  of  CDR to achieve net-negative emissions at later times, 
omission of CDR  methods aside from BECCS and A/R (Emmerling 
et al. 2019; Hilaire et al. 2019; Köberle 2019), and limited deployment 
of demand-side options (Grubler et al. 2018; van Vuuren et al. 
2018; Daioglou et al. 2019). The levels of CDR in IAMs in modelled 
pathways would change depending on the allowable overshoot of 
policy targets such as temperature or radiative forcing and the costs 
of non-CDR mitigation options (Johansson et al. 2020; van der Wijst 
et al. 2021) (Section 3.2.2).
While many CDR methods are gradually being explored, IAM scenarios 
have focused mostly on BECCS and A/R (Tavoni and Socolow 2013; 
Fuhrman et al. 2019; Rickels et al. 2019; Calvin et al. 2021; Diniz 
Oliveira et al. 2021). Although some IAM studies have also included 
other methods such as DACCS (Chen and Tavoni 2013; Marcucci et al. 
2017; Realmonte et al. 2019; Fuhrman et al. 2020; Akimoto et al. 2021; 
Fuhrman et al. 2021a), enhanced weathering (Strefler et al. 2021), SCS 
and biochar (Holz et al. 2018) there is much less literature compared 
to studies on BECCS (Hilaire et al. 2019). A  large-scale coordinated 
IAM study on BECCS (‘EMF-33’) has been conducted (Muratori et al. 
2020; Rose et al. 2020) but none exists for other CDR methods. A recent 
review proposes a combination of various CDR methods (Fuss et al. 
2018) but more in-depth literature on such a  portfolio approach is 
limited (Strefler et al. 2021). A  multi-criteria analysis has identified 
pathways with CDR portfolios different from least-cost pathways often 
dominated by BECCS and A/R (Rueda et al. 2021).
At the national and regional levels, the role of land-based biological 
CDR methods has long been analysed, but there is little detailed 
techno-economic assessment of the role of other CDR methods. There 
is a  small but emerging literature providing such assessments for 
developed countries (Kraxner et al. 2014; Baik et al. 2018; Daggash 
et al. 2018; Patrizio et al. 2018; Sanchez et al. 2018; Breyer et al. 2019; 
Kato and Kurosawa 2019; Larsen et al. 2019; McQueen et al. 2020; 

use different reporting methodologies that in some cases combine gross emissions and removals in AFOLU. Total CDR from AFOLU equals or exceeds the net negative 
emissions mentioned.

2021; Kato and Kurosawa 2021; Negri et al. 2021) while the literature 
outside developed countries is limited (Alatiq et al. 2021; Fuhrman 
et al. 2021b; Weng et al. 2021).
In IAMs, CDR is contributed mainly by the energy sector (through 
BECCS) and AFOLU (through A/R) (Figure 12.3). IAMs are starting to 
include other CDR methods, such as DACCS and enhanced weathering 
(Section 12.3.1), which are yet to be attributed to specific sectors in 
IAMs. Following IPCC guidance for UNFCCC inventories, A/R and SCS 
are reported in land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF), while 
BECCS would be reported in the sector where the carbon capture occurs, 
that is, the energy sector in the case of electricity and heat production, 
and the industry sector for BECCS linked to manufacturing (e.g., steel 
or hydrogen) (Tanzer et al. 2020; Bui et al. 2021; Tanzer et al. 2021).
12.3.1 CDR Methods Not Assessed Elsewhere 
in This Report: DACCS, Enhanced Weathering 
and Ocean-based Approaches
This section assesses the CDR methods that are not carried out solely 
within conventional sectors and so are not covered in other parts of the 
report: direct air carbon capture and storage, enhanced weathering, 
and ocean-based approaches. It provides an overview of each CDR 
method: their costs, potentials, risks and impacts, co-benefits, and 
their role in mitigation pathways. Since these processes, approaches 
and technologies have medium to low technology readiness levels, 
they are subject to significant uncertainty.
12.3.1.1 Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage (DACCS)
Direct air capture (DAC) is a  chemical process to capture ambient 
CO2 from the atmosphere. Captured CO 2 can be stored underground 
(direct air carbon capture and storage, DACCS) or utilised in 
products (direct air carbon capture and utilisation, DACCU). DACCS 
shares with conventional CCS the transport and storage components 
but is distinct in its capture part. Because CO 2 is a well-mixed GHG, 
DACCS can be sited relatively flexibly, though its locational flexibility 
is constrained by the availability of low-carbon energy and storage 
sites. Capturing the CO 2 involves three basic steps: (i) contacting the 
air, (ii) capturing on a liquid or solid sorbent or a liquid solvent, and 
(iii) regeneration of the solvent or the sorbent (with heat, moisture 
and/or pressure). After capture, the CO 2 stream can be stored 
underground or utilised. The duration of storage is an important 
consideration; geological reservoirs or mineralisation result in removal 
for more than 1000 years. The duration of the removal through DACCU 
(Breyer et al. 2019) varies with the lifetime of respective products 
(Wilcox et al. 2017; Bui et al. 2018; Fuss et al. 2018; Gunnarsson 
et al. 2018; Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering 2018; 
Creutzig et al. 2019), ranging from weeks to months for synthetic 
fuels to centuries or more for building materials (e.g., concrete cured 
Chapter 12 Cross-sectoral Perspectives12using mineral carbonation) (Hepburn et al. 2019). The efficiency and 
environmental impacts of DACCS and DACCU options depend on 
the carbon intensity of the energy input (electricity and heat) and 
other lifecycle assessment (LCA) considerations (Zimmerman 2018; 
Jacobson 2019). See Chapters 6 and 11 for further details regarding 
carbon capture and utilisation. Another key consideration is the net 
carbon CO 2 removal of DACCS over its lifecycle (Madhu et al. 2021). 
Deutz and Bardow (2021) and Terlouw et al. (2021) demonstrated 
that the life-cycle net emissions of DACCS systems can be negative, 
even for existing supply chains and some current energy mixes. They 
found that the GHG intensity of energy sources is a key factor.
DAC options can be differentiated by the specific chemical processes 
used to capture ambient CO 2 from the air and recover it from the 
sorbent (Fasihi et al. 2019). The main categories are (i) liquid solvents 
with high-temperature regeneration, (ii) solid sorbents with low-
temperature regeneration and (iii) regenerating by moisturising of 
solid sorbents. Other approaches such as electro-swing (Voskian and 
Hatton 2019) have been proposed but are less developed. Compared 
to other CDR methods, the primary barrier to upscaling DAC is its high 
cost and large energy requirement (high confidence) (Nemet et al. 
2018), which can be reduced through innovation. It has therefore 
attracted entrepreneurs and private investments (IEA 2020b).
Status: There are some demonstration projects by start-up companies 
and academic researchers, who are developing various types of DAC, 
including aqueous potassium solvent with calcium carbonation and 
solid sorbents with heat regeneration (NASEM 2019). These projects 
are supported mostly by private investments and grants or sometimes 
serve utilisation niche markets (e.g., CO 2 for beverages, greenhouses, 
enhanced oil recovery). As of 2021, there are more than ten plants 
worldwide, with a scale of ktCO 2 yr–1 or smaller (Larsen et al. 2019; 
NASEM 2019; IEA 2020b). Because of the fundamental difference in 
the CO 2 concentration at the capture stage, DACCS does not benefit 
directly from research, development and demonstration (RD&D) of 
conventional CCS. Public RD&D programmes dedicated to DAC have 
therefore been proposed (Larsen et al. 2019; NASEM 2019). Possible 
research topics include development of new liquid solvents, novel 
solid sorbents, and novel equipment or system designs, and the need 
for third-party evaluation of techno-economic aspects has also been 
emphasised (NASEM 2019). However, since basic research does 
not appear to be a primary barrier, both NASEM (2019) and Larsen 
et al. (2019) argue for a stronger focus on demonstration in the US 
context. Though the US and UK governments have begun funding 
DACCS research (IEA 2020b), the scale of R&D activities is limited.
Costs: As the process captures dilute CO 2 (~0.04%) from the 
ambient air, it is less efficient and more costly than conventional 
carbon capture applied to power plants and industrial installations 
(with a  CO 2 concentration of ~10%) (high confidence). The cost 
of a liquid solvent system is dominated by the energy cost (because 
of the much higher energy demand for CO 2 regeneration, which 
reduces the efficiency) while capital costs account for a significant 
share of the cost of solid sorbent systems (Fasihi et al. 2019). The 
range of the DAC cost estimates found in the literature is wide 
(USD60–1000 tCO 2–1) (Fuss et al. 2018) partly because different 
studies assume different use cases, differing phases (first plant vs nth plant) (Lackner et al. 2012), different configurations, and 
disparate system boundaries. Estimates of industrial origin are often 
on the lower side (Ishimoto et al. 2017). Fuss et al. (2018) suggest 
a cost range of USD600–1000 tCO 2–1 for first-of-a-kind plants, and 
USD100–300 tCO 2–1 as experience accumulates. An expert elicitation 
study found a similar cost level for 2050 with a median of around 
USD200 tCO 2–1 (Shayegh et al. 2021) (medium evidence, medium 
agreement). NASEM (2019) systematically evaluated the costs of 
different designs and found a range of 84–386 USD2015 tCO 2–1 for 
the designs currently considered by active technology developers. This 
cost range excludes the site-specific costs of transportation or storage.
Potentials: There is no specific study on the potential of DACCS but 
the literature has assumed that the technical potential is virtually 
unlimited provided that high energy requirements could be met 
(medium evidence, high agreement) (Marcucci et al. 2017; Fuss 
et al. 2018; Lawrence et al. 2018) since DACCS encounters fewer 
non-cost constraints than any other CDR method. Focusing only 
on the Maghreb region, Breyer et al. (2020) reported an optimistic 
potential 150 GtCO 2 at less than USD61 tCO 2–1 for 2050. Fuss et al. 
(2018) suggest a potential of 0.5–5 GtCO 2 yr–1 by 2050 because of 
environmental side effects and limits to underground storage. In 
addition to the ultimate potentials, Realmonte et al. (2019) noted 
the rate of scale-up as a strong constraint on deployment. Meckling 
and Biber (2021) discuss a policy roadmap to address the political 
economy for upscaling. More systematic analysis on potentials is 
necessary; first and foremost on national and regional levels, including 
the requirements for low-carbon heat and power, water and material 
demand, availability of geological storage and the need for land in 
case of low-density energy sources such as solar or wind power.
Risks and impacts: DACCS requires a considerable amount of energy 
(high confidence), depending on the type of technology, water, and 
make-up sorbents, while its land footprint is small compared to other 
CDR methods (Smith et al. 2016). Yet, depending on the source of 
energy for DACCS (e.g., renewables vs nuclear), DACCS could require 
a significant land footprint (NASEM 2019; Sekera and Lichtenberger 
2020). The theoretical minimum energy requirement for separating 
CO2 gas from the air is about 0.5 GJ tCO 2–1 (Socolow et al. 2011). 
Fasihi et al. (2019) reviewed the published estimates of energy 
requirements and found that for the current technologies, the total 
energy requirement is about 4–10 GJ tCO 2–1, with heat accounting 
for about 80% and electricity about 20% (McQueen et al. 2021). 
At a  10  GtCO 2 yr–1 sequestration scale, this would translate into 
40–100 exajoules (EJ) yr–1 of energy consumption (32–80 EJ yr–1 for 
heat and 8–20 EJ yr–1 electricity), which can be contrasted with the 
current primary energy supply of about 600  EJ yr–1 and electricity 
generation of about 100 EJ yr–1. For the solid sorbent technology, 
low-temperature heat could be sourced from heat pumps powered 
by low-carbon sources such as renewables (Breyer et al. 2020), waste 
heat (Beuttler et al. 2019), and nuclear energy (Sandalow et al. 2018). 
Unless sourced from a clean source, this amount of energy could cause 
environmental damage (Jacobson 2019). Because DACCS is an open 
system, water lost from evaporation must be replenished. Water loss 
varies, depending on technology (including adjustable factors such 
as the concentration of the liquid solvent) as well as environmental 
conditions (e.g., temperate vs tropical climates). For a liquid solvent 
Cross-sectoral Perspectives  Chapter 1212system, it can be 0–50 tH 2O tCO 2–1 (Fasihi et al. 2019). A water loss 
rate of about 1–10 tH 2O tCO 2–1 (Socolow et al. 2011) would translate 
into about 10–100 GtH 2O (10–100 km3) to capture 10 GtCO 2 from 
the atmosphere. Some solid sorbent technologies actually produce 
water as a by-product, for example 0.8–2 tH 2O tCO 2–1 for a solid-
sorbent technology with heat regeneration (Beuttler et al. 2019; 
Fasihi et al. 2019). Large-scale deployment of DACCS would also 
require a  significant quantity of materials, and energy to produce 
them (Chatterjee and Huang 2020). Hydroxide solutions are currently 
being produced as a  by-product of chlorine but replacement 
(make-up) requirement of such materials at scale exceeds the current 
market supply (Realmonte et al. 2019). The land requirements for 
DAC units are not large enough to be of concern (Madhu et al. 2021). 
Furthermore, these can be placed on unproductive lands, in contrast 
to biological CDR. Nevertheless, to ensure that CO 2-depleted air does 
not enter the air contactor of an adjacent DAC system, there must be 
enough space between DAC units, similar to wind power turbines. 
Considering this, Socolow et al. (2011) estimated a land footprint of 
1.5 km2 MtCO 2–1. In contrast, large energy requirements can lead to 
significant footprints if low-density energy sources (e.g., solar PV) are 
used (Smith et al. 2016). For the issues associated with CO 2 utilisation 
and storage, see Chapter 6.
Co-benefits: While Wohland et al. (2018) proposed solid sorbent-
based DAC plants as a Power-to-X technology that could use excess 
renewable power (at times of low or even negative prices), such 
operation would add additional costs. Installations would need to 
be designed for intermittent operations (i.e., at low load factors) 
which would negatively affect capital and operation costs (Daggash 
et al. 2018; Sandalow et al. 2018) as a high time-resolution model 
suggests a  high utilisation rate (Breyer et al. 2020). Solid sorbent 
DAC designs can potentially remove more water from the ambient 
air than needed for regeneration, thereby delivering surplus water 
that would contribute to SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) in arid 
regions (Sandalow et al. 2018; Fasihi et al. 2019).
Trade-offs and spillover effects: Liquid solvent DACCS systems 
need substantial amounts of water (Fasihi et al. 2019), although 
much less than BECCS systems (Smith et al. 2016), which could 
negatively affect SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation). Although the 
high energy demand of DACCS could affect SDG 7 (affordable and 
clean energy) negatively through potential competition or positively 
through learning effects (Beuttler et al. 2019), its impact has not been 
thoroughly assessed yet.
Role in mitigation pathways: There are a few IAM studies that 
have explicitly incorporated DACCS. Stringent emissions constraints 
in these studies lead to high carbon prices, allowing DACCS to 
play an important role in mitigation. Chen and Tavoni (2013) 
examined the role of DACCS in an IAM (WITCH) and found that 
incorporating DACCS reduces the overall cost of mitigation and tends 
to postpone the timing of mitigation. The scale of capture goes up 
to 37 GtCO 2 yr–1 in 2100. Akimoto et al. (2021) introduced DACCS 
in the IAM DNE21+, and also found the long-term marginal cost of 
abatement is significantly reduced by DACCS. Marcucci et al. (2017) 
ran MERGE-ETL, an integrated model with endogenous learning, and 
showed that DACCS allows for a model solution for the 1.5°C target, and that DACCS substitutes for BECCS under stringent targets. In their 
analysis, DACCS captures up to 38.3 GtCO 2 yr–1 in 2100. Realmonte 
et al. (2019) modelled two types of DACCS (based on liquid and solid 
sorbents) with two IAMs (TIAM-Grantham and WITCH), and showed 
that in deep mitigation scenarios, DACCS complements, rather than 
substitutes, other CDR methods such as BECCS, and that DACCS is 
effective at containing mitigation costs. At the national scale, Larsen 
et al. (2019) utilised the Regional Investment and Operations (RIO) 
Platform coupled with the Energy PATHWAYS model, and explicitly 
represented DAC in US energy systems scenarios. They found that in 
a scenario that reaches net zero emissions by 2045, about 0.6 GtCO 2 
or 1.8  GtCO 2 of DACCS would be deployed, depending on the 
availability of biological carbon sinks and bioenergy. The modelling 
supporting the European Commission’s initial proposal for net zero 
GHG emissions by 2050 incorporated DAC, with the captured CO 2 
used for both synthetic fuel production (DACCU) and storage (DACCS) 
(Capros et al. 2019). Fuhrman et al. (2021a) evaluated the role of 
DACCS across five shared socio-economic pathways with the GCAM 
modelling framework and identified a substantial role for DACCS in 
mitigation and a  decreased pressure on land and water resources 
from BECCS, even under the assumption of limited energy efficiency 
improvement and conservative cost declines of DACCS technologies. 
The newest iteration of the World Economic Outlook by IEA (2021b) 
deploys CDR on a limited scale, and DACCS removes 0.6 GtCO 2 in 

Status, costs, potentials, risk and impacts, co-benefits, trade-offs and 
spillover effects and the role in mitigation pathways of DACCS are 
summarised in Table 12.6.
12.3.1.2 Enhanced Weathering
Enhanced weathering involves (i) the mining of rocks containing 
minerals that naturally absorb CO 2 from the atmosphere over 
geological timescales (as they become exposed to the atmosphere 
through geological weathering), (ii) the comminution of these rocks 
to increase the surface area, and (iii) the spreading of these crushed 
rocks on soils (or in the ocean/coastal environments; Section 12.3.1.3) 
so that they react with atmospheric CO 2 (Schuiling and Krijgsman 
2006; Hartmann et al. 2013; Beerling et al. 2018; Goll et al. 2021). 
Construction waste and waste materials from mining can also be used 
as a  source material for enhanced weathering. Silicate rocks such 
as basalt, containing minerals rich in calcium and magnesium and 
lacking metal ions such as nickel and chromium, are most suitable for 
enhanced weathering (Beerling et al. 2018); they reduce soil solution 
acidity during dissolution, and promote the chemical transformation 
of CO 2 to bicarbonate ions. The bicarbonate ions can precipitate in 
soils and drainage waters as a  solid carbonate mineral (Manning 
2008), or remain dissolved and increase alkalinity levels in the ocean 
when the water reaches the sea (Renforth and Henderson 2017). The 
modelling study by Cipolla et al. (2021) found that rate of weathering 
is greater in high rainfall environments, and was increased by organic 
matter amendment.
Status: Enhanced weathering has been demonstrated in the 
laboratory and in small-scale field trials (TRL 3–4) but has yet to 
be demonstrated at scale (Beerling et al. 2018; Amann et al. 2020). 
Chapter 12 Cross-sectoral Perspectives12The chemical reactions are well understood (Manning 2008; Gillman 
1980; Gillman et al. 2001), but the behaviour of the crushed rocks 
in the field and potential co-benefits and adverse side effects of 
enhanced weathering require further research (Beerling et al. 2018). 
Small-scale laboratory experiments have calculated weathering 
rates that are orders of magnitude slower than the theoretical limit 
for mass transfer-controlled forsterite (Renforth et al. 2015; Amann 
et al. 2020) and basalt dissolution (Kelland et al. 2020). Uncertainty 
surrounding silicate mineral dissolution rates in soils, the fate of the 
released products, the extent of legacy reserves of mining by-products 
that might be exploited, location and availability of rock extraction 
sites, and the impact on ecosystems remain poorly quantified and 
require further research to better understand feasibility (Renforth 
2012; Moosdorf et al. 2014; Beerling et al. 2018). Closely monitored, 
large-scale demonstration projects would allow these aspects to be 
studied (Smith et al. 2019a; Beerling et al. 2020).
Costs: Fuss et al. (2018), in a  systematic review of the costs and 
potentials of CDR methods including enhanced weathering, note 
that costs are closely related to the source of the rock and the 
technology used for rock grinding and material transport (Renforth 
2012; Hartmann et al. 2013; Strefler et al. 2018). Due to differences 
in the methods and assumptions between studies, literature 
ranges are highly uncertain and range from USD15–40 tCO 2–1 to 
USD3460 tCO 2–1 (Köhler et al. 2010; Taylor et al. 2016). Renforth 
(2012) reported operational costs in the UK of applying mafic 
rocks (rocks with high magnesium and iron silicate mineral 
concentrations) of USD70–578 tCO 2–1, and for ultramafic rocks 
(rocks rich in magnesium and iron silicate minerals but with very low 
silica content  – the low silica content enhances weathering rates) 
of USD24–123 tCO 2–1. Beerling et al. (2020) combined a  spatially 
resolved weathering model with a  techno-economic assessment 
to suggest costs of between USD54–220 tCO 2–1 (with a  weighted 
mean of USD118–128 tCO 2–1). Fuss et al. (2018) suggested an 
author judgement cost range of USD50–200 tCO 2–1 for a potential of 
2–4 GtCO 2 yr−1 from 2050, excluding biological storage.
Potentials: In a  systematic review of the costs and potentials 
of enhanced weathering, Fuss et al. (2018) report a wide range of 
potentials (limited evidence, low agreement). The highest reported 
regional sequestration potential, 88.1  GtCO 2 yr−1, is reported for 
the spreading of pulverised rock over a very large land area in the 
tropics, a region considered promising given the higher temperatures 
and greater rainfall (Taylor et al. 2016). Considering cropland areas 
only, the potential carbon removal was estimated by Strefler et al. 
(2018) to be 95 GtCO 2 yr−1 for dunite and 4.9 GtCO 2 yr−1 for basalt. 
Slightly lower potentials were estimated by Lenton (2014) where 
the potential of carbon removal by enhanced weathering (including 
adding carbonate and olivine to both oceans and soils) was estimated 
to be 3.7  GtCO 2 yr–1 by 2100, but with mean annual removal an 
order of magnitude less at 0.2 GtC-eq yr–1 (Lenton 2014). The 
estimates reported in Smith et al. (2016) are based on the potential 
estimates of Lenton (2014). Beerling et al. (2020) estimate that up 
to 2 GtCO 2 yr–1 could be removed by 2050 by spreading basalt onto 
35–59% (weighted mean 53%) of agricultural land of 12 countries. 
Fuss et al. (2018) provide an author judgement range for potential of 
2–4 GtCO 2 yr−1 for 2050.Risks and impacts: Mining of rocks for enhanced weathering will 
have local impacts and carries risks similar to those associated with 
the mining of mineral construction aggregates, with the possible 
additional risk of greater dust generation from fine comminution 
and land application. In addition to direct habitat destruction and 
increased traffic to access mining sites, there could be adverse 
impacts on local water quality (Younger and Wolkersdorfer 2004).
Co-benefits: Enhanced weathering can improve plant growth by 
pH modification and increased mineral supply (Kantola et al. 2017; 
Beerling et al. 2018), can enhance SCS in some soils (Beerling et al. 
2018) thereby protecting against soil erosion (Wright and Upadhyaya 
1998), and increasing the cation exchange capacity, resulting 
in increased nutrient retention and availability (Gillman 1980; 
Baldock and Skjemstad 2000; Gillman et al. 2001; Manning 2010; 
Guntzer et al. 2012; Tubana et al. 2016; Yu et al. 2017; Haque et al. 
2019; Smith et al. 2019a). Through these actions, it can contribute 
to SDG  2  (zero hunger), SDG  15 (life on land) (by reducing land 
demand for croplands), SDG  13 (climate action) (through CDR), 
SDG 14 (life below water) (by ameliorating ocean acidification) and 
SDG  6  (clean water and sanitation) (Smith et al. 2019a). To more 
directly ameliorate ocean acidification while increasing CDR and 
reducing impacts on land ecosystems, alkaline minerals could instead 
be directly added to the ocean (Section 12.3.1.3). There are potential 
benefits in poverty reduction through employment of local workers 
in mining (Pegg 2006).
Trade-offs and spillover effects: Air quality could be adversely 
affected by the spreading of rock dust (Edwards et al. 2017), though this 
can partly be ameliorated by water-spraying (Grundnig et al. 2006). As 
noted above, any significant expansion of the mining industry would 
require careful assessment to avoid possible detrimental effects on 
biodiversity (Amundson et al. 2015). The processing of an additional 

of energy, which could represent approximately 0.1–6 % of global 
electricity use in 2100. The emissions associated with this additional 
energy generation may reduce the net carbon dioxide removal by up 
to 30% with present-day grid average emissions, but this efficiency 
loss would decrease with low-carbon power (Beerling et al. 2020).
Role in mitigation pathways: Only one study to date has included 
enhanced weathering in an integrated assessment model to explore 
mitigation pathways (Strefler et al. 2021).
Status, costs, potentials, risk and impacts, co-benefits, trade-offs and 
spillover effects and the role in mitigation pathways of enhanced 
weathering are summarised in Table 12.6.
12.3.1.3  Ocean-based Methods
The ocean, which covers over 70% of the Earth’s surface, contains 
about 38,000 gigatonnes of carbon, some 45 times more than the 
present atmosphere, and oceanic uptake has already consumed 
close to 30–40% of anthropogenic carbon emissions (Sabine 
et al. 2004; Gruber et al. 2019). The ocean is characterised by diverse 
biogeochemical cycles involving carbon, and ocean circulation has 
much longer timescales than the atmosphere, meaning that additional 
Cross-sectoral Perspectives  Chapter 1212anthropogenic carbon could potentially be stored in the ocean for 
centuries to millennia for methods that increase deep ocean-dissolved 
carbon concentrations or temporarily bury the carbon; or essentially 
permanently (over ten thousand years) for methods that store the 
carbon in mineral forms or as ions by increasing alkalinity (Siegel 
et al., 2021) (Cross-Chapter Box 8, Figure 1). A wide range of methods 
and implementation options for marine CDR have been proposed 
(Gattuso et al. 2018; Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2018; GESAMP 2019). 
The most studied ocean-based CDR methods are ocean fertilisation, 
alkalinity enhancement (including electrochemical methods) and 
intensification of biologically-driven carbon fluxes and storage in 
marine ecosystems, referred to as ‘blue carbon’. The mitigation 
potentials, costs, co-benefits and trade-offs of these three options are 
discussed below. Less well studied are methods including artificial 
upwelling, terrestrial biomass dumping into oceans, direct CO 2 
removal from seawater (with CCS), and sinking marine biomass into 
the deep ocean or harvesting it for bioenergy (with CCS) or biochar 
(GESAMP 2019). These methods are summarised briefly below. 
Potential climate response and influence on the carbon budget of 
ocean-based CDR methods are discussed in WGI AR6, Chapter 5.
Ocean fertilisation (OF)
One natural mechanism of carbon transfer from the atmosphere to 
the deep ocean is the ocean biological pump, which is driven by the 
sinking of organic particles from the upper ocean. These particles 
derive ultimately from primary production by phytoplankton and 
most of them are remineralised within the upper ocean with only 
a small fraction reaching the deep ocean where the carbon can be 
sequestered on centennial and longer timescales. Increasing nutrient 
availability would stimulate uptake of CO 2 through phytoplankton 
photosynthesis producing organic matter, some of which would be 
exported into the deep ocean, sequestering carbon. In areas of the 
ocean where macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus) are available 
in sufficient quantities (about 25% of the total area), the growth 
of phytoplankton is limited by the lack of trace elements such as 
iron. Thus, OF CDR can be based on two implementation options 
to increase the productivity of phytoplankton (Minx et al. 2018): 
macronutrient enrichment and micronutrient enrichment. A  third 
option, highlighted in GESAMP (2019), is based on fertilisation for 
fish stock enhancement, for instance, as naturally occurs in eastern 
boundary current systems. Iron fertilisation is the best-studied OF 
option to date, but knowledge so far is still inadequate to predict 
global ecological and biogeochemical consequences.
Status: OF has a  natural analogue: periods of glaciation in the 
geological past are associated with changes in deposition of dust 
containing iron into the ocean. Increased formation of phytoplankton 
has also been observed during seasonal deposition of dust from the 
Arabian Peninsula and ash deposition on the ocean surface after 
volcanic eruptions (Achterberg et al. 2013; Jaccard et al., 2013; Olgun 
et al. 2013; Martínez-García et al. 2014). OF options may appear 
technologically feasible, and enhancement of photosynthesis and 
CO2 uptake from surface waters is confirmed by a number of field 
experiments conducted in different areas of the ocean, but there is 
scientific uncertainty about the proportion of newly-formed organic 
carbon that is transferred to deep ocean, and the longevity of storage (Blain et al. 2008; Williamson et al. 2012; Trull et al. 2015). 
The efficiency of OF also depends on the region and experimental 
conditions, especially in relation to the availability of other nutrients, 
light and temperature (Aumont and Bopp 2006). In the case of 
macronutrients, very large quantities are needed and the proposed 
scaling of this technique has been viewed as unrealistic (Williamson 
and Bodle 2016).
Costs: Ocean fertilisation costs depend on nutrient production 
and its delivery to the application area (Jones 2014). The costs 
range from USD2 tCO 2–1 for fertilisation with iron (Boyd 2008) to 
USD457 tCO 2–1 for nitrate (Harrison 2013). Reported costs for 
macronutrient application at USD20 tCO 2–1 (Jones 2014) contrast 
with higher estimates by (Harrison 2013) reporting that low costs are 
due to overestimation of sequestration capacity and underestimation 
of logistical costs. The median of OF cost estimates, USD230 tCO 2–1 
(Gattuso et al., 2021) indicates low cost-effectiveness, albeit 
uncertainties are large.
Potentials: Theoretical calculations indicate that organic carbon 
export increases 2–20 kg per gram of iron added, but experiments 
indicate much lower efficiency: a  significant part of the CO 2 can 
be emitted back the atmosphere because much of the organic 
carbon produced is remineralised in the upper ocean. Efficiency also 
varies with location (Bopp et al. 2013). Between studies, there are 
substantial differences in the ratio of iron added to carbon  fixed 
photosynthetically, and in the ratio of iron added to carbon 
eventually sequestered (Trull et al. 2015), which has implications 
both for the success of this strategy and its cost. Estimates indicate 
potentially achievable net sequestration rates of 1–3 GtCO 2 yr–1 for 
iron fertilisation, translating into cumulative CDR of 100–300 GtCO 2 
by 2100 (Ryaboshapko and Revokatova 2015; Minx et al. 2018), 
whereas OF with macronutrients has a  higher theoretical 
potential of 5.5  GtCO 2 yr–1 (Harrison 2017; Gattuso et al. 2021). 
Modelling studies show a maximum effect on atmospheric CO 2 of 
15–45  parts  per  million volume in 2100 (Zeebe and Archer 2005; 
Aumont and Bopp 2006; Keller et al. 2014; Gattuso et al. 2021).
Risks and impacts: Several of the mesoscale iron enrichment 
experiments have seen the emergence of potentially toxic species 
of diatoms (Silver et al. 2010; Trick et al. 2010). There is also (limited) 
evidence of increased concentrations of other GHGs such as methane 
and nitrous oxide during the subsurface decomposition of the sinking 
particles from iron-stimulated blooms (Law 2008). Impacts on 
marine biology and food web structure are not well known, however 
OF at large scale could cause changes in nutrient distributions or 
anoxia in subsurface water (Fuhrman and Capone 1991; DFO 
2010). Other potential risks are perturbation to marine ecosystems 
via reorganisation of community structure, enhanced deep ocean 
acidification (Oschlies et al. 2010) and effects on human food supply.
Co-benefits: Co-benefits of OF include a potential increase in fish 
biomass through enhanced biological production (Minx et al. 2018) 
and reduced ocean acidification in the short term in the upper 
ocean (by CO 2 removal), though it could be enhanced in the long 
term in the ocean interior (by CO 2 release) (Oschlies et al., 2010; 
Gattuso et al. 2018).
Chapter 12 Cross-sectoral Perspectives12Trade-offs and spillover effects: Potential drawbacks include 
subsurface ocean acidification and deoxygenation (Cao and Caldeira 
2010; Oschlies et al., 2010; Williamson et al. 2012); altered regional 
meridional nutrient supply and fundamental alteration of food webs 
(GESAMP 2019); and increased production of N 2O and CH 4 (Jin and 
Gruber 2003; Lampitt et al. 2008). Ocean fertilisation is considered 
to have negative consequences for eight SDGs, and a combination 
of both positive and negative consequences for seven SDGs 
(Honegger et al. 2020).
Ocean Aakalinity enhancement (OAE)
CDR through ‘ocean alkalinity enhancement’ or ‘artificial ocean 
alkalinisation’ (Renforth and Henderson 2017) can be based on: 
(i) the dissolution of natural alkaline minerals that are added directly 
to the ocean or coastal environments; (ii) the dissolution of such 
minerals upstream from the ocean (e.g.,  enhanced weathering, 
Section  12.3.1.2); (iii) the addition of synthetic alkaline materials 
directly to the ocean or upstream; and (iv) electrochemical processing 
of seawater. In the case of (ii), minerals are dissolved on land and the 
dissolution products are conveyed to the ocean through runoff and 
river flow. These processes result in chemical transformation of CO 2 
and sequestration as bicarbonate and carbonate ions (HCO 3–, CO 32–) 
in the ocean. Imbalances between the input and removal fluxes 
of alkalinity can result in changes in global oceanic alkalinity and 
therefore the capacity of the ocean to store carbon. Such alkalinity-
induced changes in partitioning of carbon between atmosphere and 
ocean are thought to play an important role in controlling climate 
change on timescales of 1000 years and longer (e.g., Zeebe 2012). 
The residence time of dissolved inorganic carbon in the deep ocean 
is around 100,000 years. However, residence time may decrease 
if alkalinity is reduced by a  net increase in carbonate minerals by 
either increased formation (precipitation) or reduced dissolution of 
carbonate (Renforth and Henderson 2017). The alkalinity of seawater 
could potentially also be increased by electrochemical methods, 
either directly by reactions at the cathode that increase the alkalinity 
of the surrounding solution that can be discharged into the ocean, or 
by forcing the precipitation of solid alkaline materials (e.g., hydroxide 
minerals) that can then be added to the ocean (e.g., Rau et al. 2013; 
La Plante et al. 2021).
Status: OAE has been demonstrated by a small number of laboratory 
experiments (in addition to enhanced weathering, Section 12.3.1.2). 
The use of enhanced ocean alkalinity for carbon storage was first 
proposed by Kheshgi (1995) who considered the creation of highly 
reactive lime that would readily dissolve in the surface ocean and 
sequester CO 2. An alternative method proposed the dissolution of 
carbonate minerals (e.g., calcium carbonate) in the presence of waste 
flue gas CO 2 and seawater as a means capturing CO 2 and converting 
it to bicarbonate ions (Rau and Caldeira 1999; Rau 2011). House 
et al. (2007) proposed the creation of alkalinity in the ocean through 
electrolysis. The fate of the stored carbon is the same for these 
proposals (i.e., HCO 3– and CO 32– ions), but the reaction pathway is 
different. Enhanced weathering of silicate minerals such as olivine 
could add alkalinity to the ocean, for example, by placing olivine sand 
in coastal areas (Meysman and Montserrat 2017; Montserrat et al. 2017). Some authors suggest use of maritime transport to discharge 
calcium hydroxide (slaked lime) (Caserini et al. 2021).
Costs: Techno-economic assessments of OAE largely focus on 
quantifying overall energy and carbon balances. Cost ranges are 
USD40–260 tCO 2–1 (Fuss et al. 2018). Considering life-cycle carbon 
and energy balances for various OAE options, adding lime (or other 
reactive calcium or magnesium oxide/hydroxides) to the ocean would 
cost USD64–260 tCO 2–1 (Renforth et al. 2013; Renforth &  Kruger 
2013; Caserini et al. 2019). Rau (2008) and Rau et al. (2018) estimate 
that electrochemical processes for increasing ocean alkalinity may 
have a net cost of USD3–160 tCO 2–1, largely depending on energy 
cost and co-product (H 2) market value. In the case of direct addition 
of alkaline minerals to the ocean (i.e., without calcination), the cost 
is estimated to be USD20–50 tCO 2–1 (Harvey 2008; Köhler et al. 2013; 
Renforth and Henderson 2017).
Potentials: For OAE, the ocean theoretically has the capacity to 
store thousands of  GtCO 2 (cumulatively) without exceeding pre-
industrial levels of carbonate saturation (Renforth and Henderson 
2017) if the impacts were distributed evenly across the surface ocean. 
The potential of increasing ocean alkalinity may be constrained by the 
capability to extract, process, and react minerals (Section  12.3.1.2); 
the demand for co-benefits (see below), or to minimise impacts 
around points of addition. Important challenges with respect to the 
detailed quantification of the CO 2 sequestration efficiency include 
nonstoichiometric dissolution, reversed weathering and potential pore 
water saturation in the case of adding minerals to shallow coastal 
environments (Meysman and Montserrat 2017). Fuss et al. (2018) 
suggest storage potentials of 1–100 GtCO 2 yr–1. (González and Ilyina 
2016) suggested that addition of 114 picomoles of alkalinity to the 
surface ocean could remove 3400 GtCO 2 from the atmosphere.
Risks and impacts: For OAE, the local impact of increasing alkalinity 
on ocean chemistry can depend on the speed at which the impacted 
seawater is diluted/circulated and the exchange of CO 2 from the 
atmosphere (Bach et al. 2019). Also, more extreme carbonate 
chemistry perturbations due to non-equilibrated alkalinity could 
affect local marine biota (Bach et al. 2019), although biological 
impacts are largely unknown. Air-equilibrated seawater has a much 
lower potential to perturb seawater carbonate chemistry. However, 
seawater with slow air-sea gas exchange, in which alkalinity increases, 
consumes CO 2 from the surrounding water without immediate 
replenishment from the atmosphere, which would increase seawater 
pH and saturation states and may impact marine biota (Meysman 
and Montserrat 2017; Montserrat et al. 2017). It may be possible 
to use this effect to ameliorate ocean acidification. Like enhanced 
weathering, some proposals may result in the dissolution products of 
silicate minerals (e.g., silicon, iron, potassium, nickel) being supplied 
to ocean ecosystems (Meysman and Montserrat 2017; Montserrat 
et al. 2017). Ecological and biogeochemical consequences of OAE 
largely depend on the minerals used. When natural minerals such 
as olivine are used, the release of additional Si and Fe could have 
fertilising effects (Bach et al. 2019). In addition to perturbations 
to marine ecosystems via reorganisation of community structure, 
potentially adverse effects of OAE that should be studied include 
Cross-sectoral Perspectives  Chapter 1212the release of toxic trace metals from some deposited minerals 
(Hartmann et al. 2013).
Co-benefits: Intentional addition of alkalinity to the oceans 
through OAE would decrease the risk to ocean ecosystems caused 
by the  CO 2-induced impact of ocean acidification on marine biota 
and the global carbon cycle (Doney et al. 2009; Köhler et al. 2010; Rau 
et al. 2012; Williamson and Turley 2012; Albright et al. 2016; Bach et al. 
2019). OAE could be jointly implemented with enhanced weathering 
(Section  12.3.1.2), spreading the finely crushed rock in the ocean 
rather than on land. Regional alkalinisation could be effective in 
protecting coral reefs against acidification (Feng et al. 2016; Mongin 
et al., 2021) and coastal OAE could be part of a broader strategy for 
geochemical management of the coastal zone, safeguarding specific 
coastal ecosystems, such as important shellfisheries, from the adverse 
impact of ocean acidification (Meysman and Montserrat 2017).
Trade-offs and spillover effects: There is a  paucity of research 
on biological effects of alkalinity addition. The very few studies that 
have explored the impact of elevated alkalinity on ocean ecosystems 
have largely been limited to single species experiments (Cripps et al. 
2013; Gore et al. 2019) and a  constrained field study quantifying 
the net calcification response of a  coral reef flat to alkalinity 
enhancement (Albright et al. 2016). The addition rate would have 
to be great enough to overcome mixing of the local seawater 
with the ambient environment, but not sufficient to detrimentally 
impact ecosystems. More research is required to assess locations in 
which this may be feasible, and how such a  scheme may operate 
(Renforth and Henderson 2017). The environmental impact of 
large-scale release of natural dissolution products into the coastal 
environment will strongly depend on the scale of olivine application, 
the characteristics of the coastal water body (e.g., residence time) 
and the particular biota present (e.g., coral reefs will react differently 
compared with seagrasses) (Meysman and Montserrat 2017). Model 
simulations (González et al. 2018) suggest that termination of OAE 
implemented on a massive scale under a high CO 2 emission scenario 
(Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5) might pose high risks to 
biological systems sensitive to rapid environmental changes because 
it would cause a sharp increase in ocean acidification. For example, 
OAE termination would lead to a  decrease in surface pH in warm 
shallow regions where vulnerable coral reefs are located, and a drop 
in the carbonate saturation state. However, other studies with lower 
levels of OAE have shown no termination effect (Keller et al., 2014).
Blue carbon management
The term ‘blue carbon’ was used originally to refer to biological carbon 
sequestration in all marine ecosystems, but it is increasingly applied 
to CDR associated with rooted vegetation in the coastal zone, such 
as tidal marshes, mangroves and seagrasses. Potential for carbon 
sequestration in other coastal and non-coastal ecosystems, such as 
macroalgae (e.g., kelp), is debated (Krause-Jensen and Duarte, 2016; 
Krause-Jensen et al., 2018). In this report, blue carbon refers to CDR 
through coastal blue carbon management.
Status: In recent years, there has been increasing research on the 
potential, effectiveness, risks, and possibility of enhancing CO 2 sequestration in shallow coastal ecosystems (Duarte, 2017). About 
20% of the countries that are signatories to the Paris Agreement 
refer to blue carbon approaches for climate change mitigation 
in their NDCs and are moving toward measuring blue carbon in 
inventories. About 40% of those same countries have pledged to 
manage shallow coastal ecosystems for climate change adaptation 
(Kuwae and Hori 2019).
Costs: There are large differences in the cost of CDR applying blue 
carbon management methods between different ecosystems (and at 
the local level). Median values are estimated as USD240, 30,000, and 

habitats (Gattuso et al. 2021). Currently estimated cost effectiveness 
(for climate change mitigation) is very low (Siikamäki et al. 2012; 
Bayraktarov et al. 2016; Narayan et al. 2016).
Potentials: Globally, the total potential carbon sequestration 
rate through blue carbon CDR is estimated in the range 
0.02–0.08  GtCO 2 yr–1 (Wilcox et al. 2017; National Academies 
of Sciences 2019). Gattuso et al. (2021) estimate the theoretical 
cumulative potential of coastal blue carbon management by 2100 
to be 95 GtCO 2, taking into account the maximum area that can be 
occupied by these habitats and historic losses of mangroves, seagrass 
and salt marsh ecosystems.
Risks and impacts: For blue carbon management, potential risks 
relate to the high sensitivity of coastal ecosystems to external impacts 
associated with both degradation and attempts to increase carbon 
sequestration. Under expected future warming, sea level rise and 
changes in coastal management, blue carbon ecosystems are at risk, 
and their stored carbon is at risk of being lost (Bindoff et al. 2019).
Co-benefits: Blue carbon management provides many non-climatic 
benefits and can contribute to ecosystem-based adaptation, also 
reducing emissions associated with habitat degradation and loss 
(Howard et al. 2017; Hamilton and Friess 2018). Shallow coastal 
ecosystems have been severely affected by human activity; significant 
areas have already been deforested or degraded and continue to be 
denuded. These processes are accompanied by carbon emissions. The 
conservation and restoration of coastal ecosystems, which will lead to 
increased carbon sequestration, is also essential for the preservation 
of basic ecosystem services, and healthy ecosystems tend to be more 
resilient to the effects of climate change.
Trade-offs and spillover effects: Blue carbon management 
schemes should consist of a  mix of restoration, conservation and 
areal increase, including complex engineering interventions that 
enhance natural capital, safeguard their resilience and the ecosystem 
services they provide, and decrease the sensitivity of such ecosystems 
to further disturbances.
Overview of other ocean-based CDR approaches
Artificial upwelling: This concept uses pipes or other methods to 
pump nutrient-rich deep ocean water to the surface where it has 
a fertilising effect (see OF section). To achieve CO 2 removal at a Gt 
magnitude, modelling studies have shown that artificial upwelling

Cross-sectoral Perspectives  Chapter 1212would have to be implemented on a  massive scale (over 50% of 
the ocean to deliver maximum rate of 10GtCO 2 yr–1 under RCP8.5) 
(Oschlies et al., 2010, Keller et al. 2014). Because the deep water 
is much colder than surface water, at massive scale this could cool 
the Earth’s surface by several degrees, but the cooling effect would 
cease as the deeper ocean warms, and would reverse, leading 
to rapid warming, if the pumping ceased (Oschlies et al., 2010, 
Keller et al. 2014).
Furthermore, the cooling would also severely alter atmospheric 
circulation and precipitation patterns (Kwiatkowski et al. 2015). 
Several upwelling approaches have been developed and tested (Pan 
et al., 2016) and more R&D is underway.
Terrestrial biomass dumping: There are proposals to sink terrestrial 
biomass (crop residues or logs) into the deep ocean as a means of 
sequestering carbon (Strand and Benford 2009). Sinking biochar 
has also been proposed (Miller and Orton, 2021). Decomposition 
would be inhibited by the cold and sometimes hypoxic/anoxic 
environment on the ocean floor, and absence of bacteria that 
decompose terrestrial lignocellulosic biomass, so storage timescale 
is estimated at hundreds to thousands of years (Strand and Benford 
2009) (Burdige 2005). Potential side effects on marine ecosystems, 
chemistry, or circulation have not been thoroughly assessed. Neither 
have these concepts been evaluated with respect to the impacts on 
land from enhanced transfer of nutrients and organic matter to the 
ocean, nor the relative merits of alternative applications of residues 
and biochar as an energy source or soil amendment (Chapter 7).
Marine biomass CDR options: Proposals have been made to grow 
macroalgae (Duarte et al., 2017) for BECCS (N’Yeurt et al. 2012; Duarte 
et al. 2013; Chen et al., 2015), to sink cultured macroalgae into the 
deep sea, or to use marine algae for biochar (Roberts et al., 2015). 
Naturally-growing sargassum has also been considered for these 
purposes (Bach et al., 2021). Froehlich et al. (2019) found a substantial 
area of the ocean (about 48 million km2) suitable for farming seaweed. 
N’Yeurt et al. (2012) suggested that converting 9% of the oceans to 
macroalgal aquaculture could take up 19 GtCO 2 in biomass, generate 

biogas could be captured and sequestered. Productivity of farmed 
macroalgae in the open ocean could potentially be enhanced through 
fertilising via artificial upwelling (Fan et al., 2020) or through cultivation 
platforms that dive at night to access nutrient-rich waters below the, 
often nutrient-limited, surface ocean. If the biomass were sunk, it is 
unknown how long the carbon would remain in the deep ocean and 
what the additional impacts would be. Research and development on 
macroalgae cultivation and use is currently underway in multiple parts 
of the world, though not necessarily directly focused on CDR. 
Extraction of CO 2 from seawater (with storage): CO 2 can be 
extracted by applying a  vacuum, or by purging with a  gas low in 
CO2 (Koweek et al., 2016). CO 2 stripping can also be accomplished 
by acidifying seawater with a mineral acid, or through electrodialysis 
and electrolysis, to convert bicarbonate ions (HCO 3–) to CO 2 (Willauer 
et al., 2017; Eisaman et al., 2018; Digdaya et al., 2020; Eisaman 2020; 
Sharifian et al., 2021). The removal of CO 2 from the ocean surface 
leads to undersaturation in the water, thus forcing CO 2 to move from the atmosphere into the ocean to restore equilibrium. Electrochemical 
seawater CO 2 extraction has been modelled, prototyped, and 
analysed from a techno-economic perspective (Eisaman et al., 2012; 
Willauer et al., 2017; de Lannoy et al., 2018; Eisaman et al., 2018a; 
Eisaman et al., 2018b).
Status, costs, potentials, risk and impacts, co-benefits, trade-offs and 
spillover effects and the role in mitigation pathways of ocean-based 
approaches are summarised in Table 12.6.
12.3.1.4 Feasibility Assessment
Following the framework presented in Section  6.4 and Annex II, 
Part  IV, Section  11, a  multi-dimensional feasibility assessment of 
the CDR methods covered here is provided in Figure  12.4, taking 
into account the assessment presented in this section. Both DACCS 
and EW perform positively on the geophysical and technological 
dimensions while for ocean-based approaches performance is mixed. 
There is limited evidence to assess social-cultural, environmental/
ecological, and institutional dimensions as the literature is still 
nascent for DACCS and EW, while these aspects are positive for blue 
carbon and mixed or negative for ocean fertilisation. On the economic 
dimension, the cost is assessed negatively for all CDR methods.
12.3.2 Consideration of Methods Assessed in 
Sectoral Chapters: A/R, Biochar, BECCS, 
Soil Carbon Sequestration
Status: BECCS, afforestation/reforestation (A/R), soil carbon 
sequestration (SCS) and biochar are land-based biological CDR 
methods (Smith et al. 2016). BECCS combines biomass use for energy 
with CCS to capture and store the biogenic carbon geologically 
(Section  6.4.2.6); A/R and SCS involve fixing atmospheric carbon 
in biomass and soils, and biochar involves converting biomass to 
biochar and using it as a soil amendment. These CDR methods can 
be associated with both co-benefits and adverse side effects (Smith 
et al. 2016; Hurlbert et al. 2019; Mbow et al. 2019; Olsson et al. 2019; 
Schleicher et al. 2019; Smith et al. 2019b; Babin et al. 2021; Dooley 
et al. 2021) (Sections 7.4 and 12.5).
Among CDR methods, BECCS and A/R are most commonly selected by 
IAMs to meet the requirements of scenarios that limit warming to 2°C 
(>67%) or lower. This is partially because of the long lead time required 
to refine IAMs to include additional methods and update techno-
economic parameters. Currently, few IAMs represent SCS or biochar 
(Frank et al. 2017). Given the removal potential of SCS and biochar and 
some potential co-benefits, more efforts should be made to include 
these methods within IAMs, so that their mitigation potential can be 
compared to other CDR methods, along with possible co-benefits and 
adverse side effects (Smith et al. 2016; Rogelj et al. 2018) (Section 12.5).
Potential: The technical potential for BECCS by 2050 is estimated at 
0.5–11.3 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 (Table 7.3). These potentials do not include 
avoided emissions resulting from the use of heat, electricity and/or 
fuels provided by the BECCS system, which depend on substitution 
patterns, conversion efficiencies, and supply chain emissions for the 
Chapter 12 Cross-sectoral Perspectives12BECCS and substituted energy systems (Box  7.7). The mitigation 
effect of BECCS also depends on how deployment affects land carbon 
stocks and sink strength (Section 7.4.4).
As detailed in Chapter 7, the technical potential for gross removals 
realised through A/R in 2050 is 0.5–10.1  GtCO 2-eq yr–1, and for 
improved forest management the potential is 1–2.1 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 
(including both CDR and emissions reduction). Technical potential for 
SCS in 2050 is estimated to be 0.6–9.4 GtCO 2-eq yr–1, for agroforestry 
it is 0.3–9.4 GtCO 2-eq yr–1, and for biochar it is 0.2–6.6 GtCO 2-eq yr–1. 
Peatland and coastal wetland restoration have a technical potential 
of 0.5–2.1  GtCO 2-eq yr–1 in 2050, with an estimated 80% of the 
potential being CDR.  Note that these potentials reflect only 
biophysical and technological conditions and become reduced when 
factoring in economic, environmental, socio-cultural and institutional 
constraints (Table 12.6).
Costs: Costs across technologies vary substantially (Smith 
et al. 2016) and were estimated to be USD15–400 tCO 2–1 for 
BECSS, USD0–240 tCO 2–1 for A/R, –USD45 to +USD100 tCO 2–1 
for SCS and USD10–345 tCO 2–1 for biochar. Fuss et al. (2018) 
estimated abatement cost ranges for BECCS, A/R, SCS and biochar 
to be 100–200, 5–50, 0–100, and 30–120 tCO 2-eq−1 respectively, 
corresponding to 2100  potentials. Ranges for economic potential 
(<USD100 tCO 2–1) reported in Chapter 7 are 0.5–3.0 GtCO 2 yr–1 (A/R); 
0.6–1.9  GtCO 2 yr–1 (improved forest management); 0.7–2.5  GtCO 2 yr–1 
(SCS); 0.4–1.1 GtCO 2 yr–1 (agroforestry); 0.3–1.8 GtCO 2 yr–1 (biochar); 
and 0.2–0.8 GtCO 2 yr–1 (peatland and coastal wetland restoration).
Risks, impacts, and co-benefits: a brief summary of risks, impacts 
and co-benefits is provided here and more detail is provided 
in Chapter  7  and Section  12.5. A/R and biomass production for 
BECCS and biochar potentially compete for land, water and other 
resources, implying possible adverse outcomes for ecosystem health, 
biodiversity, livelihoods and food security (medium evidence, high 
agreement) (Smith et al. 2016; Heck et al. 2018; Hurlbert et al. 2019; 
Mbow et al. 2019) (Chapter 7). SCS requires the addition of nitrogen 
and phosphorus to maintain stoichiometry of soil organic matter, 
leading to a potential risk of eutrophication (Fuss et al. 2018). Apart 
from possible negative effects associated with biomass supply, 
adverse side effects from biochar are relatively low if the biomass is 
uncontaminated (Tisserant and Cherubini 2019).
Possible climate risks relate to direct and/or indirect land carbon 
losses (A/R, BECCS, biochar), increased N 2O emissions (BECCS, SCS), 
saturation and non-permanence of carbon storage (A/R, SCS) (Jia et al. 
2019; Smith et al. 2019b) (Chapter 7), and potential CO 2 leakage from 
deep geological reservoirs (BECCS) (Chapter 6). Land cover change 
associated with A/R and biomass supply for BECCS and biochar may 
cause albedo changes that reduce mitigation effectiveness (Fuss 
et al. 2018; Jia et al. 2019). Potentially unfavourable albedo change 
resulting from biochar use can be minimised by incorporating biochar 
into the soil (Fuss et al. 2018) (Chapter 7).
Concerning co-benefits, A/R and biomass production for BECCS or 
biochar could improve soil carbon, nutrient and water cycling (robust 
evidence, high agreement), and contribute to market opportunities, employment and local livelihoods, economic diversification, energy 
security, and technology development and transfer (medium evidence, 
high agreement) (Fuss et al. 2018) (Chapter  7). It may contribute 
to reduction of other air pollutants, health benefits, and reduced 
dependency on imported fossil fuels. A/R can improve biodiversity 
if native and diverse species are used (Fuss et al. 2018). For biochar, 
additional co-benefits include increased crop yields, reduced drought 
impacts, and reduced CH 4 and N 2O emissions from soils (Joseph et al., 
2021) (Section 7.4.5.2). SCS can improve soil quality and resilience 
and improve agricultural productivity and food security (Frank et al. 
2017; Smith et al. 2019b).
Role in mitigation pathways: Biomass use for BECCS in 2050 is 

limiting warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot (C1, 
excluding traditional energy). This corresponds to 5.3  GtCO 2 yr–1 
(1.1–18 GtCO 2 yr–1) CDR, if assuming 28 kg C GJ–1 biomass carbon 
content and 85% capture rate in BECCS systems. In scenarios that 
limit warming to 2°C (>67%) (C3), biomass use for BECCS in 2050 
is 28 EJ yr–1 (0–96 EJ yr–1, 5–95th percentile range), corresponding 
to 2.4 GtCO 2 yr–1 (0–8.3 GtCO 2 yr–1) CDR. Cumulative CO 2 removal 
from AFOLU (mainly through A/R), as reported from models, 
in the period 2020 to 2100 is 262  GtCO 2 (17–397  GtCO 2) and 

(5–95th percentile range).
Uncertainties remain in two main areas: the availability of land and 
biomass, which is affected by many factors (Anandarajah et al. 2018) 
(Chapter 7), and the role of other mitigation measures including CDR 
methods other than A/R and BECCS. Strong near-term climate change 
mitigation to limit overshoot, and deployment of CDR methods other 
than A/R and BECCS, may significantly reduce the contribution of 
these CDR methods in scenarios limiting warming to 1.5°C or 2°C 
(Köberle 2019; Hasegawa et al. 2021).
Trade-offs and spillovers: Some land-based biological CDR 
methods, such as BECCS and A/R, demand land. Combining 
mitigation strategies has the potential to increase overall carbon 
sequestration rates (Humpenöder et al. 2014). However, these 
CDR methods may also compete for resources (Frank et al. 2017). 
Land-based mitigation approaches currently propose the use of 
forests (i) as a source of woody biomass for bioenergy and various 
biomaterials and (ii)  for  carbon sequestration in vegetation, soils, 
and forest products. Forests are therefore required to provide 
both provisioning (biomass feedstock) and regulating (carbon 
sequestration) ecosystem services. This multifaceted strategy has 
the potential to result in trade-offs (Makkonen et al. 2015). Some 
land-based mitigation options could conflict with biodiversity goals, 
e.g., A/R using monoculture plantations can reduce species richness 
when introduced into (semi-)natural grasslands (Smith et al. 2019a; 
Dooley et al. 2021). When trade-offs exist between biodiversity 
protection and mitigation objectives, biodiversity is typically given 
a lower priority, especially if the mitigation option is considered risk-
free and economically feasible (Pörtner et al. 2021). Approaches that 
promote synergies, such as sustainable forest management, reducing 
deforestation rates, cultivation of perennial crops for bioenergy in 
sustainable farming practices, and mixed-species forests in A/R, can

to deliver land-based mitigation options that also limit trade-offs 
with biodiversity (Longva et al. 2017) (Cross-Working Group Box 3: 
Mitigation and Adaptation via the Bioeconomy, in this chapter).

See also Section 12.5.
12.3.3 CDR Governance and Policies
As shown in Cross-Chapter Box  8  in this chapter, CDR fulfils 
multiple functions in different phases of ambitious mitigation: 
(i) further reducing net CO 2 or GHG emission levels in the near term; 
(ii)  counterbalancing residual emissions (from hard-to-transition 
sectors like transport, industry, or agriculture) to help reach net zero 
CO2 or GHG emissions in the mid term; (iii) achieving and sustaining 
net-negative CO 2 or GHG emissions in the long term. While inclusion 
of emissions and removals on managed land (LULUCF) is mandatory 
for developed countries under UNFCCC inventory rules (Grassi et al. 
2021), not all Annex I countries have included land-based biological 
removals when setting domestic mitigation targets in the past, 
but updated NDCs for 2030 indicate a  shift, most notably in the 
European Union (Gheuens and Oberthür 2021; Schenuit et al. 2021). 
The early literature on CDR governance and policy has been mainly 
conceptual rather than empirical, focusing on high-level principles 
(see the concerns listed in the introduction to Section 12.3) and the 
representation of CDR in global mitigation scenarios (Section 3.2.2). 
However, with the widespread adoption of net zero targets and the 
recognition that CDR is a necessary element of mitigation portfolios to 
achieve net zero CO 2 or GHG emissions, countries with national net-
zero emissions targets have begun to integrate CDR into modelled 
national mitigation pathways, increase research, development and 
demonstration (RD&D) efforts on CDR methods, and consider CDR-
specific incentives and policies (Honegger et al. 2021b; Schenuit et al. 
2021) (Box 12.1). Nevertheless, this increasing consideration of CDR 
has not yet extended to net-negative targets and policies to achieve 
these. While the use of CDR at levels that would lead to net negative CO2 or GHG emissions in the long term has been assumed in most 
global mitigation scenarios that limit warming to 1.5°C, net-negative 
emissions trajectories and BECCS as the main CDR method modelled 
to achieve these have not been mirrored by corresponding UNFCCC 
decisions so far (Fridahl 2017; Mohan et al. 2021). Likewise, only 
a few national long-term mitigation plans or legal acts entail a vision 
for net-negative GHG emissions (Buylova et al. 2021), for example 
Finland, Sweden, Germany and Fiji.
For countries with emissions targets aiming for net zero or lower, the 
core governance question is not whether CDR should be mobilised 
or not, but which CDR methods governments want to see deployed 
by whom, by when, at which volumes and in which ways (Minx et al. 
2018; Bellamy and Geden 2019). The choice of CDR methods and the 
scale and timing of their deployment will depend on the respective 
ambitions for gross emissions reductions, how sustainability and 
feasibility constraints are managed, and how political preferences 
and social acceptability evolve (Bellamy 2018; Forster et al. 2020; 
Fuss et al. 2020; Waller et al. 2020; Clery et al. 2021; Iyer et al. 2021; 
Rogelj et al. 2021). As examples of emerging CDR policymaking 
at (sub-)national levels show, policymakers are beginning to 
incorporate CDR methods beyond those currently dominating global 
mitigation scenarios, that is, BECCS and afforestation/reforestation 
(Bellamy and Geden 2019; Buylova et al. 2021; Schenuit et al. 2021; 
Uden et al. 2021) (Box  12.1). CDR policymaking is faced with the 
need to consider method-specific timescales of CO 2 storage, as 
well as challenges in MRV and accounting, potential co-benefits, 
adverse side effects, interactions with adaptation and trade-offs 
with SDGs (Dooley and Kartha 2018; McLaren et al. 2019; Buck 
et al. 2020; Honegger et al. 2020; Brander et al. 2021; Dooley et al. 
2021; Mace et al. 2021) (Table  12.6). Therefore, CDR governance 
and policymaking are expected to focus on responsibly incentivising 
RD&D and targeted deployment, building on both technical and 
governance experience with already widely practised CDR methods 
like afforestation/reforestation (Lomax et al. 2015; Field and Mach 
2017; Bellamy 2018; Carton et al. 2020; VonHedemann et al. 2020), as 
well as learning from two decades of slow-moving CCS deployment 
(Buck 2021; Martin-Roberts et al. 2021; Wang et al. 2021). For some 
less well-understood methods and implementation options, such as 
ocean alkalinisation or enhanced weathering, investment in RD&D 
can help in understanding the risks, rewards, and uncertainties of 
deployment (Nemet et al. 2018; Fajardy et al. 2019; Burns and Corbett 
2020; Goll et al. 2021).
Box 12.1 | Case Study: Emerging CDR Policy, Research and Development in the United Kingdom
Climate change mitigation policies in the UK have been motivated since 2008 by a  domestic, legally-binding framework. This 
framework includes a 2050 target for net zero greenhouse gas emissions, interim targets and an independent advisory body called the 
Climate Change Committee (Muinzer 2019). It has led successive UK governments to publish mitigation plans to 2050, causing policy 
to be more forward looking (Averchenkova et al. 2021).
The UK’s targets include emissions and removals from LULUCF . In 2008 the target for 2050 was an economy-wide net emissions 
reduction of at least 80% below 1990 levels. Even the first government plans to achieve this target proposed deployment of removal 
methods, specifically afforestation and wood in construction, increased soil carbon and BECCS (HM Government 2011).
Chapter 12 Cross-sectoral Perspectives12Since the enhancement of carbon sinks is a form of climate change 
mitigation (Honegger et al. 2021a), CDR governance challenges will 
in many respects be similar to those around emissions reduction 
measures, as will policy instruments like RD&D funding, carbon pricing, 
tax or investment credits, certification schemes, and public procurement 
(Sections 13.4, 13.6, 14.4 and 14.5). Effectively integrating CDR into 
mitigation portfolios can build on already existing rules, procedures 
and instruments for emissions abatement (Torvanger 2019; Fridahl 
et al. 2020; Zakkour et al. 2020; Honegger et al. 2021b; Mace et al. 2021; 
Rickels et al. 2021). Additionally, to accelerate RD&D and to incentivise 
CDR deployment, a  political commitment to formal integration into 
existing climate policy frameworks is required (robust evidence, 
high agreement) (Lomax et al. 2015; Geden et al. 2018; Honegger 
and Reiner 2018; VonHedemann et al. 2020; Schenuit et al. 2021). 
To avoid CDR being misperceived as a substitute for deep emissions 
reductions, the prioritisation of emissions cuts can be signalled and 
achieved with differentiated target setting for reductions and removals 
(Geden et al. 2019; McLaren et al. 2019). Similarly, sub-targets are 
conceivable for different types of CDR, to prioritise preferred methods 
according to characteristics such as removal processes or timescales of 
storage (Smith 2021).
IPCC guidance on quantifying removals is available for land-based 
biological CDR methods (IPCC 2006, 2019), but has yet to be 
developed for other CDR methods (Royal Society and Royal Academy 
of Engineering 2018). Challenges with development of estimation 
algorithms, data collection, and attribution between sectors and 
countries will need to be overcome (Luisetti et al. 2020; Wedding 
et al. 2021). Trusted methodologies for MRV, required to enable 
private sector participation. will need to address the permanence, 
leakage, and saturation challenges with land- and ocean-based 
biological methods (Mace et al. 2021). Protocols that also capture 
social and ecological co-benefits could encourage the adoption of biological CDR methods such as SCS, biochar, A/R and blue carbon 
management (robust evidence, high agreement) (VonHedemann 
et al. 2020; Macreadie et al. 2021).
Private capital and companies, impact investors, and philanthropy 
will play a  role in technical demonstrations and bringing down 
costs, as well as creating demand for carbon removal products on 
voluntary markets, which companies may purchase to fulfil corporate 
social responsibility-driven targets (Friedmann 2019; Fuss et al. 2020; 
Joppa et al. 2021). Niche markets can provide entry points for limited 
deployment of novel CDR methods (Cox and Edwards 2019), but 
targeting currently existing revenue streams by using CO 2 captured 
from the atmosphere in Enhanced Oil Recovery and other utilisation 
routes (Mackler et al. 2021; Meckling and Biber 2021) is contested, 
and highlights the importance of choosing appropriate system 
boundaries when assessing supply chains (Tanzer and Ramírez 2019; 
Brander et al. 2021). While the private sector will play a distinct role 
in scaling CDR, governments will need to commit to developing 
infrastructure for the transport and storage of CO 2, including 
financing, permitting, and regulating liabilities (Sanchez et al. 2018; 
Mace et al. 2021; Mackler et al. 2021).
International governance considerations include global technology 
transfer around CDR implementation options (Batres et al. 2021); 
land use change that could affect food production and land condition 
and cause conflict around land tenure and access (Dooley and Kartha 
2018; Hurlbert et al. 2019; Milne et al. 2019); and efforts to create 
sustainable and just supply chains for CDR (Fajardy and Mac Dowell 
2020; Tan et al. 2021), such as resources used for BECCS, enhanced 
weathering, or ocean alkalinisation. International governance would 
be particularly important for methods posing transboundary risks, 
especially for ocean-based methods. Specific regulations have so 
far only been developed in the context of the London Protocol, an Box 12.1 (continued)
Adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015 caused the government to change the legislated 2050 target to a reduction of at least 100% 
(i.e., net zero). Since then, removal of CO 2 and other greenhouse gases has received greater prominence as a distinct topic. The most 
recent national plan (published October 2021) proposes deployment not only of the methods mentioned above, but also DACCS, 
biochar and enhanced weathering. The government has committed to amend accounting of UK targets to include a wider range of 
removal methods beyond LULUCF , and set a target of 5 MtCO 2 yr–1 from methods such as BECCS, DACCS and enhanced weathering 
by 2030. It is consulting on markets and incentives for deployment, and exploring new requirements for MRV (HM Government 2021).
In parallel to these policy developments, the UK funds research into technical, environmental and social aspects of removal (Lezaun 
et al. 2021). Research on some elements (e.g., forestry, CCS, soils, bioenergy) have been funded for well over a decade, but the first 
programme dedicated to greenhouse gas removal ran during 2017–2021. This has been followed by two new programmes with 
greater focus on demonstration, totalling GBP100 million over four years (HM Government 2021). A  wide variety of methods is 
supported in these programmes, covering approaches such as CO 2 capture from seawater and capture of methane from cattle, in 
addition to those included already in national mitigation scenarios.
Deployment of removal methods has lagged behind expectations, as national targets for tree planting are not being met and 
infrastructure for CO 2 transport and storage is not yet in place (Climate Change Committee 2021). While public awareness around 
carbon removal is low, studies indicate support in general, provided it is perceived as enhancing rather than impeding action to reduce 
emissions (Cox et al. 2020a).

alkalinity enhancement (GESAMP 2019; Burns and Corbett 2020; 
Boettcher et al. 2021) (Section 14.4.5).
Engagement of civil society organisations and publics will be important 
for shaping CDR policy and deployment (medium evidence,  high 
agreement). Public awareness of CDR and its role in national net 
zero emissions strategies is generally very low (Cox et al. 2020a), and 
perceptions differ across countries and between methods (Bertram 
and Merk 2020; Spence et al. 2021; Sweet et al. 2021; Wenger et al. 
2021). When awareness increases, social processes will shape political 
attitudes on CDR (Shrum et al. 2020), as will efforts to frame particular 
CDR methods as ‘natural’ or ‘technological’ (Osaka et al. 2021), and the 
policy instruments chosen to support CDR (Bellamy et al. 2019). Lack 
of confidence in CDR implementation options from both publics and 
investors, and lack of trust in project developers (Cox et al. 2020b) have 
hampered support for CCS (Thomas et al. 2018) and are expected to 
affect deployment of CDR methods with geological storage (Gough and 
Mander 2019). On local and regional scales, CDR projects will need to 
consider air and water quality, impacts to human health, energy needs, 
land use and ecological integrity, and local community engagement 
and procedural justice. Bottom-up and community-driven strategies 
are important for deploying equitable carbon removal projects (Batres 
et al. 2021; Hansson et al. 2021).
12.4 Food systems
12.4.1 Introduction
This section complements Chapter 7 by reviewing recent estimates of 
food system emissions and assessing options beyond the agriculture, 
forestry and land use sectors to mitigate food systems GHG 
emissions. A food system approach enables identification of cross-
sectoral mitigation opportunities including both technological and 
behavioural options. Further, a system approach permits evaluation 
of policies that do not necessarily directly target primary producers 
or consumers, but other food system actors, with possibly higher 
mitigation efficiency. A food system approach was introduced in the 
IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL) (Mbow et al. 
2019). Besides major knowledge gaps in the quantification of food 
system GHG emissions (Section 12.4.2), the SRCCL authors identified 
as major knowledge gaps the understanding of the dynamics 
of  dietary change (including behavioural patterns, the adoption of 
plant-based dietary patterns, and interaction with human health and 
nutrition of sustainable healthy diets and associated feedbacks); 
and instruments and mechanisms to accelerate transitions towards 
sustainable and healthy food systems.
Sufficient food and adequate nutrition are fundamental human needs 
(HLPE 2020; Ingram 2020). Food needs to be grown and processed, 
transported and distributed, and finally prepared and consumed. Food 
systems range from traditional, involving only few people and short 
supply chains, to modern food systems, comprising complex webs 
involving large numbers of stakeholders and processes that grow and 
transform food commodities into food products and distribute them globally (Gómez and Ricketts 2013; HLPE 2017). A  ‘food system’ 
includes all food chain activities (production, processing, distribution, 
preparation, consumption of food) and the management of food 
loss and wastes. It also includes institutions and infrastructures 
influencing any of these activities, as well as people and systems 
impacted (HLPE 2017; FAO 2018a). Food choices are determined 
by the food environment, consisting of the ‘physical, economic, 
political and socio-cultural context in which consumers engage with 
the food system to acquire, prepare and consume food’ (HLPE 2017). 
Food system outcomes encompass food and nutrition, productivity, 
profit and livelihood of food producers and other actors in food value 
chains, but also social outcomes and the impact on the environment 
(Zurek et al. 2018). ‘Sustainable healthy diets’ have been defined 
by FAO and WHO (FAO and WHO 2019) as ‘dietary patterns that 
promote all dimensions of individuals’ health and wellbeing; have 
low environmental pressure and impact; are accessible, affordable, 
safe and equitable; and are culturally acceptable’.
The SRCCL estimated overall global anthropogenic emissions from 
food systems to range between 10.8 and 19.1  GtCO 2-eq yr–1, 
equivalent to 21–37% of total anthropogenic emissions (Mbow 
et al. 2019; Rosenzweig et al. 2020a). The authors identified major 
knowledge gaps for the GHG emissions inventories of food systems, 
particularly in providing disaggregated emissions from the food 
industry and transportation. The food system approach taken in 
the SRCCL (Mbow et al. 2019) evaluates the synergies and trade-
offs of food system response options and their implications for food 
security, climate change adaptation and mitigation. This integrated 
framework allows the identification of fundamental attributes of 
responses to maximise co-benefits, while avoiding maladaptation 
measures and adverse side effects. A  food system approach 
supports the design of interconnected climate policy responses to 
tackle climate change, incorporating perspectives of producers 
and consumers. The SRCCL (Mbow et al. 2019) found that the 
technical mitigation potential by 2050 of demand-side responses 
at 0.7–8.0  GtCO 2-eq yr–1 is  comparable to supply-side options at 
2.3–9.6 GtCO 2-eq yr–1. This shows that mitigation actions need to go 
beyond food producers and suppliers to incorporate dietary changes 
and consumers’ behavioural patterns and reveals that producers and 
consumers need to work together to reduce GHG emissions.
Though total production of calories is sufficient for the world 
population (Wood et al. 2018; Benton et al. 2019), availability and 
access to food is unequally distributed, and there is a lack of nutrient-
dense foods, fruit and vegetables (Berners-Lee et al. 2018; KC et al. 
2018). In 2019, close to 750 million people were food insecure. An 
estimated 2  billion people lacked adequate access to safe and 
nutritious food in both quality and quantity (FAO et al. 2020). Two 
billion adults are overweight or obese through inadequate nutrition, 
with an upward trend globally (FAO et al. 2019). Low intake of fruit 
and vegetables is further aggravated by high intake rates of refined 
grains, sugar and sodium, together leading to a  high risk of non-
communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease and type 

2019; GBD 2017 Diet Collaborators et al. 2019; Willett et al. 2019) 
(robust evidence, high agreement). At least 340 million children 
under five years of age experience lack of vitamins or other essential 
Chapter 12 Cross-sectoral Perspectives12bio-available nutrients, including almost 200 million suffering from 
stunting, wasting or overweight (UNICEF 2019).
Bodirsky et al. (2020) find that the global prevalence of overweight 
will increase to 39–52% of world population in 2050 (from 29% in 
2010; range across the Shared Socio-economic Pathways studied), 
and the prevalence of obesity to 13–20% (9% in 2010). The 
prevalence of underweight people was predicted to approximately 
halve, with absolute numbers stagnating at 0.4–0.7 billion. Although 
many studies represent future pathways of diets and food systems, 
there are few holistic and consistent narratives and quantification 
of the future pathways of diets and food systems (Mitter et al. 2020; 
Mora et al. 2020). Alternative pathways for improved diets and food 
systems have been developed, emphasising climate, environmental 
and  health co-benefits (Bajželj et al. 2014; Hedenus et al. 2014; 
Damerau et al. 2016; Weindl et al. 2017a; Weindl et al. 2017b; 
Springmann et al. 2018a; Bodirsky et al. 2020; Prudhomme et al. 
2020; Hamilton et al. 2021), reduced food waste and closing yield 
gaps (Bajželj et al. 2014; Pradhan et al. 2014), nitrogen management 
(Bodirsky et al. 2014), urban and peri-urban agriculture (Kriewald 
et al. 2019) and different sustainability targets (Henry et al. 2018b). 
The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has examined 
three alternative food system scenarios: ‘business as usual’, ‘towards 
sustainability’, and ‘stratified societies’ (FAO 2018b). Others have 
identified research priorities or changes in legislation needed to 
support adoption of improved food systems (Mylona et al. 2018).
Malnutrition aggravates susceptibility of children to various 
infectious diseases (França et al. 2009; Farhadi and Ovchinnikov 
2018), and infectious diseases can also decrease nutrient uptake, 
thereby promoting malnutrition (Farhadi and Ovchinnikov 2018). 
Contamination of food with bacteria, viruses, parasites and microbial 
toxins can cause foodborne illnesses (Ricci et al. 2017; Abebe 
et al. 2020; Gallo et al. 2020), foodborne substances such as food 
additives and specific proteins can cause adverse reactions, and 
contamination with toxic chemical substances used in agriculture 
and food processing can lead to poisoning or chronic diseases (Gallo 
et al. 2020). Further, health risks from food systems may originate 
from the use of antibiotics in livestock production and the occurrence 
of anti-microbial resistance in pathogens (ECDC et al. 2015; Bennani 
et al. 2020), or zoonotic diseases such as COVID-19 (Gan et al. 2020; 
Patterson et al. 2020; Vågsholm et al. 2020).
Modern food systems are highly consolidated, through vertical and 
horizontal integration (Swinnen and Maertens 2007; Folke et al. 2019). 
This consolidation has led to uneven distribution of power across the 
food value chain, with influence concentrated among a few actors in 
the post-farmgate food supply chain (e.g., large food processors and 
retailers), and has contributed to a loss of indigenous agriculture and 
food systems, for example on Pacific Islands (Vogliano et al. 2020). 
While agricultural producers contribute a higher proportion of GHG 
emissions compared with other actors in the supply chain, they have 
relatively little power to change the system (Clapp 2019; Group of 
Chief Scientific Advisors 2020; Leip et al. 2021).
In 2016, the agriculture, fisheries, and forestry sectors employed 
29% of working people; employment within these sectors was 4% in developed countries, down from 9% in 1995, and 57% in least 
developed countries, down from 71% in 1995 (World Bank 2021). 
Employment in other (non-agriculture) food system sectors, such as 
the food processing industry and service sectors, differs between food 
systems. The share of total non-farm food system employment ranges 
from 10% in traditional food systems (e.g., sub-Saharan Africa), to over 
50% in food systems in transition (e.g., Brazil), to high shares (80%) 
in modern food systems (e.g., US) (Townsend et al. 2017). The share of 
the food expenditures that farmers receive is decreasing; at the global 
level, this share has been estimated at 27% in 2015 (Yi et al. 2021).
12.4.2 GHG Emissions from Food Systems
12.4.2.1 Sectoral Contribution of GHG Emissions 
from Food Systems
New calculations using the EDGAR v6.0 (Crippa et al. 2021a) and 
FAOSTAT (FAO 2021) databases provide territorial-based food 
system GHG emissions by country globally for the period 1990 
to 2018 (Crippa et al. 2021b). The data are calculated based on 
a combination of country-specific data and aggregated information 
as described by Crippa et al. (2021b) and Tubiello et al. (2021). The 
data show that, in 2018, 17 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 (95% confidence range 
13–23  GtCO 2-eq yr–1, calculated according to Solazzo et al. (2020)) 
were associated with the production, processing, distribution, 
consumption of food and management of food system residues. 
This corresponded to 31% (range 23–42%) of total anthropogenic 
GHG emissions of 54  GtCO 2-eq yr–1. Based on the IPCC sectoral 
classification (Table 12.7 and Figure 12.5), the largest contribution 
of food systems GHG emissions in 2018 was from agriculture, that 
is, livestock and crop production systems (6.3 GtCO 2-eq yr–1, range 
2.6–11.9) and land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) 
(4.0  GtCO 2-eq yr–1, range 2.1–5.9) (Figure  12.5). Emissions from 
energy use were 3.9  GtCO 2-eq yr–1 (3.6–4.4), waste management 
1.7  GtCO 2-eq yr–1 (0.9–2.6), and industrial processes and product 
use 0.9 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 (0.6–1.1). The share of GHG emissions from 
food systems generated outside the AFOLU (agriculture and LULUCF) 
sectors has increased over recent decades, from 28% in 1990 
to 39% in 2018.
Energy: Emissions from energy use occur throughout the food 
supply chain. In 2018, the main contributions came from energy 
industries supplying electricity and heat (970 MtCO 2-eq yr–1), 
manufacturing and construction (920 MtCO 2-eq yr–1, of which 29% 
was attributable to the food, beverage, and tobacco industry), and 
transport (760 MtCO 2-eq yr–1). These emissions were almost entirely 
as CO 2. Energy emissions from forestry and fisheries amounted 
to 480 MtCO 2-eq yr–1, with 91% of emissions as CO 2. Emissions 
from residential and commercial fuel combustion contributed 

1.7 MtCH 4 yr–1) and 130 MtCO 2-eq yr–1 (with 98% of emissions as 
CO2), respectively.
Refrigeration uses an estimated 43% of energy in the retail sector 
(Behfar et al. 2018) and significantly increases fuel consumption 
during distribution. Besides being energy intensive, supermarket 
Cross-sectoral Perspectives  Chapter 1212refrigeration also contributes to GHG emissions through leakage of 
refrigerants (fluorinated gases, or F-gases), although their contribution 
to food system GHG emissions is estimated to be minor (Crippa et al. 
2021b). The cold chain accounts for approximately 1% of global GHG 
emissions, but as the volume of refrigerators per capita in developing 
countries is reported to be one order of magnitude lower than in 
developed countries (19 m3 versus 200 m3 refrigerated storage 
capacity per 1000 inhabitants), the importance of refrigeration 
to total GHG emissions is expected to increase (James and James 
2010). Although refrigeration gives rise to GHG emissions, both 
household refrigeration and effective cold chains could contribute 
to a substantial reduction in losses of perishable food and thus in 
emissions associated with food provision (University of Birmingham 
2018; James and James 2010). A trade-off exists between reducing 
food waste and increased refrigeration emissions, with the benefits 
depending on type of produce, location and technologies used 
(Sustainable Cooling for All 2018; Wu et al. 2019).
Transport has overall a  minor importance for food system GHG 
emissions, with a share of 5% to 6% (Poore and Nemecek 2018; Crippa 
et al. 2021b). The largest contributor to food system transport GHG 
emissions was road transport (92%), followed by marine shipping 
(4%), rail (3%), and aviation (1%). Only looking at energy needs, air 
or road transport consumes one order of magnitude higher energy 
(road: 70–80 MJ t–1 km–1; aviation: 100–200 MJ t–1 km–1) than 
marine shipping (10–20 MJ t–1 km–1) or rail (8–10 MJ t–1 km–1) 
(FAO  2011). For specific food products with high water content, 
relatively low agricultural emissions and high average transport distances, the share of transport in total GHG emissions can be 
over 40% (e.g., bananas, with total global average GHG emissions 
of 0.7 kgCO 2-eq kg–1) (Poore and Nemecek 2018), but transport is 
a  minor source of GHG emissions for most food products (Poore 
and Nemecek 2018).
Industry: Direct industrial emissions associated with food systems are 
generated by the refrigerants industry (580 MtCO 2-eq yr–1 as F-gases) 
and the fertiliser industry for ammonia production (280 MtCO 2-eq yr–1 
as CO 2) and nitric acid (60 MtCO 2-eq yr–1 as N 2O). The industry 
sector data account for CO 2 stored in urea (–50 MtCO 2-eq yr–1). 
Packaging contributed about 6% of total food system emissions 
(0.98 GtCO 2-eq yr–1, 91% as CO 2, with CH 4 emissions of 2.8 Mt CH 4 
yr–1). Major emissions sources are pulp and paper (60 MtCO 2-eq yr–1) 
and aluminium (30 MtCO 2-eq yr–1), with ferrous metals, glass, and 
plastics making a smaller contribution. High shares of emissions from 
packaging are found for beverages and some fruit and vegetables 
(Poore and Nemecek 2018).
Waste: Management of waste generated in the food system 
(including  food waste, wastewater, packaging waste, etc.) leads 
to biogenic GHG  emissions, and contributed 1.7  GtCO 2-eq yr–1 to 
food systems’ GHG emissions in 2018. Of these emissions, 55% 
were from domestic and commercial wastewater (30 MtCH 4 yr–1 
and  310 ktN 2O yr–1), 36%  from solid waste management (20 MtCH 4 yr–1 
and 310 ktN 2O yr–1), and 8% from industrial wastewater (4 MtCH 4 yr–1 
and 80 ktN 2O yr–1). Emissions from waste incineration and other 
waste management systems contributed 1%.

Chapter 12 Cross-sectoral Perspectives1212.4.2.2 GHG Intensities of Food Commodities
There is high variability in the GHG emissions of different food 
products and production systems (Figure  12.6). GHG emissions 
intensities  – measured using attributional lifecycle assessment, 
considering the full supply chain, expressed as CO 2-eq per kg of 
product or per kg of protein  – are generally highest for ruminant 
meat, cheese, and certain crustacean species (e.g.,  farmed shrimp 
and prawns, trawled lobster) (Nijdam et al. 2012; Clark and Tilman 
2017; Clune et al. 2017; Hilborn et al. 2018; Poore and Nemecek 
2018) (robust evidence, high agreement). Generally, beef from dairy 
systems has a lower footprint (8–23 kgCO 2-eq per 100 g protein than 
beef from beef herds (17–94 kgCO 2-eq per 100 g protein (Figure 12.6, 
re-calculated from Poore and Nemecek (2018) using AR6 GWPs 
based on a  100year horizon) (medium evidence, high agreement). 
The wide variation in emissions from beef reflects differences in 
production systems, which range from intensive feedlots with stock 
raised largely on grains through to rangeland and transhumance 
production systems. Dairy systems are generally more intensive 
production systems, with higher digestibility feed than beef systems. 
Further, emissions from dairy systems are shared between milk and meat, which brings GHG footprints of beef from dairy herds closer to 
those of meat from monogastric animals, with emissions intensities 
of pork (4.4–13  kgCO 2-eq per 100 g  protein) and poultry meat 
(2.3–11 kgCO 2-eq per 100 g protein) (Poore and Nemecek 2018).
Emissions intensities for farmed fish ranged from 2.4–11 kgCO 2-eq 
per 100 g protein (Poore and Nemecek 2018). For Norwegian seafood, 
large differences have been found ranging from 1.1 kgCO 2-eq kg–1 
edible product for herring to more than 8  kgCO 2-eq kg–1 edible 
product for salmon shipped by road and ferry from Oslo to Paris 
(Winther et al. 2020). For capture fish, large differences in emissions 
have been found, ranging from 0.2–7.9 kgCO 2-eq kg–1 landed fish 
(Parker et al. 2018), although an environmental comparison of 
capture fish to farmed foods should include other indicators such as 
overfishing. Plant-based foods generally have lower GHG emissions 
(–2.2 to +4.5 kgCO 2-eq per 100 g protein) than farmed animal-based 
foods (Nijdam et al. 2012; Clark and Tilman 2017; Clune et al. 2017; 
Hilborn et al. 2018; Poore and Nemecek 2018) (robust evidence, high 
agreement). Several plant-based foods are associated with emissions 
from land use change, for example, palm oil, soy and coffee (Poore 
and Nemecek 2018), although emissions intensities are context Waste

Cross-sectoral Perspectives  Chapter 1212specific (Meijaard et al. 2020) and for plant-based proteins, GHG 
footprints per serving remain lower than those of animal source 
proteins (Kim et al. 2019).
In traditional production systems, especially in developing countries, 
livestock serve multiple functions, providing draught power, fertiliser, 
investment and social status, besides constituting an important source 
of nutrients (Weiler et al. 2014). In landscapes dominated by forests 
or cropland, semi-natural pastures grazed by ruminants provide 
heterogeneity that supports biodiversity (Röös et al. 2016). Grazing 
on marginal land and the use of crop residues and food waste can 
provide human-edible food with lower demands for cropland (Röös 
et al. 2016; Van Zanten et al. 2018; Van Hal et al. 2019). Animal protein 
requires more land than vegetable protein, so switching consumption 
from animal to vegetable proteins could reduce the pressure on 
land resources and potentially enable additional mitigation through 
expansion of natural ecosystems, storing carbon  while supporting 
biodiversity, or reforestation to sequester carbon and enhance wood 
supply capacity for the production of bio-based products substituting 
fossil fuels, plastics, cement, etc. (Schmidinger and Stehfest 2012; 
Searchinger et al. 2018b; Hayek et al. 2021). At the same time, 
alternatives to animal-based meat and other livestock products are 
being developed (Figure 12.6). Their increasing visibility in supermarkets 
and catering services, as well as falling production prices, could make 
meat substitutes competitive in one to two decades (Gerhardt et al. 
2019). However, uncertainty around their uptake creates uncertainty 
around their effect on future GHG emissions.12.4.2.3 Territorial National Per Capita GHG Emissions 
from Food Systems
Food systems are connected to other societal systems, such as the 
energy system, financial system, and transport system (Leip et al. 
2021). Also, food systems are dynamic and continuously changing 
and adapting to existing and anticipated future conditions. Food 
production systems are very diverse and vary by farm size, intensity 
level, farm specialisation, technological level, production methods 
(e.g., organic, conventional, etc.), with differing environmental and 
social consequences (Václavík et al. 2013; Fanzo 2017; Herrero et al. 
2017; Herrero et al. 2021).
Various frameworks have been proposed to assess sustainability of 
food systems, including metrics and indicators on environmental, 
health, economic and equity issues, pointing to the importance of 
recognising the multi-dimensionality of food system outcomes 
(Gustafson et al. 2016; Chaudhary et al. 2018; Hallström et al. 2018; 
Zurek et al. 2018; Eme et al. 2019; Béné et al. 2020; Hebinck et al. 2021). 
Data platforms are being developed, but so far comprehensive data 
for evidence-based food system policy are lacking (Fanzo et al. 2020).
To visualise several food systems dimensions in a  GHG context, 
Figure 12.7 shows GHG emissions per capita and year for regional 
country aggregates (Crippa et al. 2021a; Crippa et al. 2021b),

inventories: emissions are assigned to the country where they occur, 
not where food is consumed (Crippa et al. 2021a; Crippa et al. 2021b) 
(Section 12.4.2.1). The colours of the bubbles indicate the relative 
contribution of the following risk factors to deaths, according to 
the classification used in the Global Burden of Disease Study: child 
and maternal malnutrition (red, deficiencies of iron, zinc or Vitamin 
A, or low birth weight or child growth failure), dietary risks (yellow, 
for example diets low in vegetables, legumes, whole grains or diets 
high in red and processed meat and sugar-sweetened beverages) 
or high body mass index (blue). The combined contribution 
of these three risk factors to total deaths varies strongly and is 
between 28% and 88% of total deaths. Figure  12.7 shows that 
dietary risk factors are prevalent throughout all regions. Though 
not a complete measure of the health impact of food, these were 
selected as a proxy for nutritional adequacy and balance of diets, 
avoidance of food insecurity, over- or mal-nutrition and associated non-communicable diseases (GBD 2017 Diet Collaborators 2018; 
GBD 2017 Diet Collaborators et al. 2019).
The share of GHG emissions from energy use is taken as a proxy for 
the structure of food supply in a region (Section 12.4.1), and the cost 
for food as a  proxy for the structure of the demand side and the 
access to (healthy) food (Chen et al. 2016; Finaret and Masters 2019; 
Hirvonen et al. 2019; HLPE 2020; Springmann et al. 2021), though 
acknowledging the limitations of such a simplification.
While total food system emissions in 2018 range between 0.9 and 
8.5 tCO 2-eq per capita per year between regions, the share of energy 
emissions relative to energy and land-based (agriculture and food 
system land-use change) emissions ranges between 3% and 78%.

Countries with high share 
of food imports have 
lower territorial GHG 
emissions (seen speciﬁcally 
in the Asia-Paciﬁc 
Developed region).Countries with high share 
of food exports have 
increased territorial GHG 
emissions, and a low to 
moderate share of energy 
food system emissions. Some countries with low/medium industrialisation (low share 
of energy food system emissions) have high per capita 
territorial GHG emissions because of land-use change 
emissions that are partly ‘exported’ to industrialised 
importing consumers. Often this is associated with emerging 
dietary risks and challenges of high BMI.
With Increasing industrialisation (high share of energy food 
system emissions) the wholesale cost for food tends to 
increase and health problems due to overweight dominate.Low per capita territorial 
GHG emissions are found 
in countries with low 
consumption rates 
of meat.North and

GHG emissions from energy use.  GHG emissions are calculated according to the IPCC Tier 1 approach and are assigned to the country where they occur, not necessarily 
where the food is consumed. Health outcome is expressed as relative contribution of each of the following risk factors to their combined risk for deaths: child and maternal 
malnutrition (red), dietary risks (yellow) or high body mass index (blue).  Sources: wholesale cost of food per capita: Springmann et al. 2021); territorial food system GHG 
emissions: EDGAR v.6, Crippa et al. (2021a), recalculated according to Crippa et al. (2021b) using AR6 GWPs; deaths attributed to dietary factors: IHME (2018); GBD 2017 Diet 
Collaborators et al. (2019).
Cross-sectoral Perspectives  Chapter 1212and the costs of nutrient-adequate diets often exceeds those of diets 
delivering adequate energy (Hirvonen et al. 2019; Bai et al. 2020; FAO 
et al. 2020). Thus, low-income households in industrialised countries 
can also be affected by food insecurity (Penne and Goedemé 2020).
12.4.3 Mitigation Opportunities
GHG emissions from food systems can be reduced by targeting direct 
or indirect GHG emissions in the supply chain including enhanced 
carbon sequestration, by introducing sustainable production methods 
such as agroecological approaches which can reduce system-level 
GHG emissions of conventional food production and also enhance 
resilience (HLPE 2019), by substituting food products with high GHG 
intensities with others of lower GHG intensities, by reducing food 
over-consumption, and/or by reducing food loss and waste. The 
substitution of food products with others that are more sustainable 
and/or healthier is often called ‘dietary shift’.
Clark et al. (2020) showed that even if fossil fuel emissions were 
eliminated immediately, food system emissions alone would 
jeopardise the achievement of the 1.5ºC target and threaten the 
2ºC target. They concluded that both demand-side and supply-side 
strategies are needed, including a  shift to a  diet with lower GHG 
intensity and rich in plant-based ‘conventional’ foods (e.g., pulses, 
nuts), or new food products that could support dietary shift. 
Such dietary shift needs to overcome socio-cultural, knowledge, 
and economic barriers to significantly achieve GHG mitigation 
(Section 12.4.5).
Food losses occur at the farm, post-harvest and during the food 
processing/wholesale stages of a food supply chain, while in the final 
retail and consumption stages the term food waste is used (HLPE 
2014). Typically, food losses are linked to technical issues such as 
lack of infrastructure and storage, while food waste is often caused 
by socio-economic and behavioural factors. Mitigation opportunities 
through reducing food waste and loss exist in all food supply chain 
stages and are described in the sub-sections below.
Food system mitigation opportunities are divided into five categories 
as given in Table 12.8:
• Food production from agriculture, aquaculture, and fisheries 
(Chapter 7.4 and Section 12.4.3.1)
• Controlled-environment agriculture (Section 12.4.3.2)
• Emerging food production technologies (Section 12.4.3.3)
• Food processing industries (Section 12.4.3.4)
• Storage and distribution (Section 12.4.3.5)
Food system mitigation opportunities can be either incremental 
or transformative (Kugelberg et al. 2021). Incremental options are 
based on mature technologies, for which processes and causalities 
are understood, and their implementation is generally accepted by 
society. They do not require a substantial change in the way food 
is produced, processed, or consumed and might lead to a  (slight) 
shift in production systems or preferences. Transformative mitigation 
opportunities have wider food system implications and usually coincide with a significant change in food choices. They are based 
on technologies that are not yet mature and are expected to 
require further innovation (Klerkx and Rose 2020), and/or mature 
technologies that might already be part of some food systems but are 
not yet widely accepted and have transformative potential if applied 
at large scale, for example consumption of insects (Raheem et al. 
2019a). Many emerging technologies might be seen as a further step 
in agronomic development where land-intensive production methods 
relying on the availability of naturally-available nutrients and water 
are successively replaced with crop variants and cultivation practices 
reducing these dependencies at the cost of larger energy input 
(Winiwarter et al. 2014). Others suggest a  shift to agroecological 
approaches combining new scientific insights with local knowledge 
and cultural values (HLPE 2019). Food system transformation can 
lead to regime shifts or (fast) disruptions (Pereira et al. 2020) if driven 
by events that are out of control of private or public measures and 
have a ‘crisis’ character (e.g., BSE) (Skuce et al. 2013).
Table  12.8 summarises the main characteristics of food system 
mitigation opportunities, their effect on GHG emissions, and 
associated co-benefits and adverse effects.
Agricultural food production systems range from smallholder 
subsistence farms to large animal production factories, in open 
spaces, greenhouses, rural areas or urban settings.
Dietary shift: Studies demonstrate that a  shift to diets rich in 
plant-based foods, particularly pulses, nuts, fruits and vegetables, 
such as vegetarian, pescatarian or vegan diets, could lead to 
substantial reduction of greenhouse gas emissions as compared to 
current dietary patterns in most industrialised countries, while also 
providing health benefits and reducing mortality from diet-related 
non-communicable diseases (Springmann et al. 2018a; Chen et al. 
2019; Willett et al. 2019; Bodirsky et al. 2020; Costa Leite et al. 2020; 
Ernstoff et al. 2020; Jarmul et al. 2020; Semba et al. 2020; Theurl et al. 
2020; Hamilton et al. 2021).
Pulses such as beans, chickpeas, or lentils, have a protein composition 
complementary to cereals, providing together all essential amino 
acids (Foyer et al. 2016; McDermott and Wyatt 2017). Bio-availability 
of proteins in foods is influenced by several factors, including 
amino acid composition, presence of anti-nutritional factors, and 
preparation method (Hertzler et al. 2020; Weindl et al. 2020; Semba 
et al. 2021). Soy beans, in particular, have a  well-balanced amino 
acid profile with high bio-availability (Leinonen et al. 2019). Pulses 
are part of most traditional diets (Semba et al. 2021) and supply up 
to 10–35% of protein in low-income countries, but consumption 
decreases with increasing income and they are globally only a minor 
share of the diet (McDermott and Wyatt 2017). Pulses play a key role 
in crop rotations, fixing nitrogen and breaking disease cycles, but 
yields of pulses are relatively low and have seen small yield increases 
relative to those of cereals (Foyer et al. 2016; McDermott and Wyatt 
2017; Barbieri et al. 2021; Semba et al. 2021).
Technological innovations: have made food production more 
efficient since the onset of agriculture (Winiwarter et al. 2014; 
Herrero et al. 2020). Emerging technologies include digital agriculture

Chapter 12 Cross-sectoral Perspectives12(using advanced sensors, big data), gene technology (crop bio-

intensification (automation of processes, improved inputs, precision 
agriculture) (Herrero et al. 2020), or multi-trophic aquaculture 
approaches (Knowler et al. 2020; Sanz-Lazaro and Sanchez-Jerez 
2020), though literature on aquaculture and fisheries in the context of 
GHG mitigation is limited.
Such technologies may contribute to a reduction of GHG emissions 
at the food system level, enhanced provision of food, better 
consideration of ecosystem services, and/or contribute to nutrition-
sensitive agriculture, for example, by increasing the nutritional quality 
of staple crops, increasing the palatability of leguminous crops such 
as lupines, or increasing the agronomic efficiency or resilience of 
crops with good nutritional characteristics.
For details on agricultural mitigation opportunities refer to Section 7.4.
12.4.3.1 Controlled-environment Agriculture
Controlled-environment agriculture is mainly based on hydroponic or 
aquaponic cultivation systems that do not require soil. Aquaponics 
combine hydroponics with a re-circulating aquaculture compartment 
for integrated production of plants and fish (Junge et al. 2017; 
Maucieri et al. 2018), while aeroponics is a further development of 
hydroponics that replaces water as a growing medium with a mist of 
nutrient solution (Al-Kodmany 2018). Aquaponics could potentially 
produce proteins in urban farms, but the technology is not yet mature 
and its economic and environmental performance is unclear (Love 
et al. 2015; O’Sullivan et al. 2019).
Controlled-environment agriculture is often undertaken in urban 
environments to take advantage of short supply chains (O’Sullivan 
et al. 2019), and might use abandoned buildings or be integrated in 
supermarkets, producing for example herbs ‘on demand’.
Optimising growing conditions, hydroponic systems achieve higher 
yields than un-conditioned agriculture (O’Sullivan et al. 2019); 
and yields can be further enhanced in CO 2-enriched atmospheres 
(Shamshiri et al. 2018; Armanda et al. 2019). By using existing 
spaces or modular systems that can be vertically stacked, this 
technology minimises land demand, however it is energy intensive 
and requires large financial investments. So far, only a few crops 
are commercially produced in vertical farms, including lettuce and 
other leafy greens, herbs and some vegetables, due to their short 
growth period and high value (Benke and Tomkins 2017; Armanda 
et al. 2019; Beacham et al. 2019; O’Sullivan et al. 2019). Through 
breeding, other crops could reach commercial feasibility, or crops 
with improved taste or nutritional characteristics can be grown 
(O’Sullivan et al. 2019).
In controlled-environment agriculture, photosynthesis is fuelled by 
artificial light through LEDs or a combination of natural light with 
LEDs. Control of the wave band and light cycle of the LEDs and micro-
climate can be used to optimise photosynthetic activity, yield and 
crop quality (Gómez and Gennaro Izzo 2018; Shamshiri et al. 2018).Co-benefits of controlled-environment agriculture include minimising 
water and nutrient losses as well as agro-chemical use (Al-Kodmany 
2018; Shamshiri et al. 2018; Armanda et al. 2019; Farfan et al. 2019; 
O’Sullivan et al. 2019; Rufí-Salís et al. 2020) (robust evidence, high 
agreement). Water is recycled in a  closed system and additionally 
some plants generate fresh water by evaporation from grey or black 
water, and high nutrient use efficiencies are possible. Food production 
from controlled-environment agriculture is independent of weather 
conditions and able to satisfy some consumer demand for locally-
produced fresh and diverse produce throughout the year (Benke and 
Tomkins 2017; Al-Kodmany 2018; O’Sullivan et al. 2019).
Controlled-environment agriculture is a  very energy intensive technology 
(mainly for cooling) and its GHG intensity depends therefore crucially 
on the source of the energy. Options for reducing GHG intensity include 
reducing energy use through improved lighting and cooling efficiency 
or by employing low-carbon energy sources, potentially integrated into 
the building structure (Benke and Tomkins 2017).
Comprehensive studies assessing the GHG balance of controlled-
environment agriculture are lacking. The overall GHG emissions 
from controlled-environment agriculture is therefore uncertain and 
depends on the balance of reduced GHG emissions from production 
and distribution and reduced land requirements, versus increased 
external energy needs.
12.4.3.2 Emerging Foods and Production Technologies
A diverse range of novel food products and production systems 
are emerging, that are proposed to reduce GHG emissions from 
food production, mainly by replacing conventional animal-source food  
with alternative protein sources. Assessments of the potential of 
dietary changes are given in Sections  5.3 and 7.4. Here, we assess 
the GHG intensities of emerging food production technologies. This 
includes products such as insects, algae, mussels and products from 
bio-refineries, some of which have been consumed in certain societies 
and/or in smaller quantities (Pikaar et al. 2018; Jönsson et al. 2019; 
Govorushko 2019; Raheem et al. 2019a; Souza Filho et al. 2019). The 
novel aspect considered here is the scale at which they are proposed to 
replace conventional food with the aim to reduce both negative health 
and environmental impacts. To fully realise the health benefits, dietary 
shifts should also encompass a  reduction in consumption of added 
sugars, salt, saturated fats, and potentially harmful additives (Curtain 
and Grafenauer 2019; Fardet and Rock 2019; Petersen et al. 2021).
Meat analogues have attracted substantial venture capital, and 
production costs have dropped considerably in the last decade, with 
some reaching market maturity (Mouat and Prince 2018; Santo et al. 
2020), but there is uncertainty whether they will ‘disrupt’ the food 
market or remain niche products. According to Kumar et al. (2017), the 
demand for plant-based meat analogues is expected to increase as 
their production is relatively cheap and they satisfy consumer demands 
with regard to health and environmental concerns as well as ethical 
and religious requirements. Consumer acceptance is still low for some 
options, especially insects (Aiking and de Boer 2019) and cultured 
meat (Chriki and Hocquette 2020; Siegrist and Hartmann 2020).
Cross-sectoral Perspectives  Chapter 1212Insects: Farmed edible insects have a higher feed conversion ratio 
than other animals farmed for food, and have short reproduction 
periods with high biomass production rates (Halloran et al. 2016). 
Insects have good nutritional qualities (Parodi et al. 2018). They 
are suited as a protein source for both humans and livestock, with 
high protein content and favourable fatty acid composition (Fasolin 
et al. 2019; Raheem et al. 2019b). If used as feed, they can grow on 
food waste and manure; if used as food, food safety concerns and 
regulations can restrict the use of manure (Raheem et al. 2019b) or 
food waste (Varelas 2019) as growing substrates, and the dangers 
of pathogenic or toxigenic microorganisms and incidences of anti-
microbial resistance need to be managed (Garofalo et al. 2019).
Algae and bivalves have a high protein content and a favourable 
nutrient profile and can play a  role in providing sustainable food. 
Bivalves are high in omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin B12 and 
therefore well suited as replacement of conventional meats, and have 
a lower GHG footprint (Parodi et al. 2018; Willer and Aldridge 2020). 
Micro- and macro algae are rich in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, 
anti-oxidants and vitamins (Parodi et al. 2018; Peñalver et al. 2020; 
Torres-Tiji et al. 2020). Kim et al. (2019) show that diets with modest 
amounts of animals low on the food chain such as forage fish, 
bivalves, or insects have similar GHG intensities to vegan diets. Algae 
and bi-valves can be used to filter nutrients from waters, though care 
is required to avoid accumulation of hazardous substances (Gentry 
et al. 2020; Willer and Aldridge 2020).
Plant-based meat, milk and egg analogues: Demand for plant-
based proteins is increasing and incentivising the development of 
protein crop varieties with improved agronomic performance and/
or nutritional quality (Santo et al. 2020). There is also an emerging 
market for meat replacements based on plant proteins, such as 
pulses, cereals, soya, algae and other ingredients mainly used 
to imitate the taste, texture and nutritional profiles of animal-
source food (Kumar et al. 2017; Boukid 2021). Currently, the 
majority of plant-based meat analogues is based on soy (Semba 
et al. 2021). While other products still serve a niche market, their 
share is growing rapidly and some studies project a  sizeable 
share within a decade (Kumar et al. 2017; Jönsson et al. 2019). In 
particular, plant-based milk alternatives have seen large increases 
in market share (Jönsson et al. 2019). A  LCA of 56 plant-based 
meat analogues showed mean GHG intensities (farm to factory) 
of 0.21–0.23 kgCO 2-eq per 100 g of product or 20 g of protein for 
all assessed protein sources (Fresán et al. 2019). Higher footprints 
were found in the meta-review by Santo et al. (2020). Including 
preparation, Meija et al. (2019) found higher emissions for burgers 
and sausages as compared to minced products.
Cellular agriculture: The use of fungi, algae and bacteria is an old 
process (beer, bread, yoghurt) and serves, among others, for the 
preservation of products. The concept of cellular agriculture (Mattick 
2018) covers bio-technological processes that use micro-organisms 
to produce acellular (fermentation-based cellular agriculture) or 
cellular products. Yeasts, fungi or bacteria can synthesise acellular 
products such as haem, milk and egg proteins, or protein-rich animal 
feed, other food ingredients, and pharmaceutical and material 
products (Rischer et al. 2020; Mendly-Zambo et al. 2021). Cellular products include cell tissues such as muscle cells to grow cultured 
meat, fish or other cells (Post 2012; Rischer et al. 2020) and products 
where the micro-organisms will be eaten themselves (Pikaar et al. 
2018; Sillman et al. 2019; Schade et al. 2020). Single cell proteins, 
combined with photovoltaic electricity generation and direct air 
capture of carbon dioxide, are proposed as highly land- and energy-
efficient alternatives to plant-based protein (Leger et al. 2021). 
Some microbial proteins are produced in a  ‘bioreactor’ and use 
Haber-Bosch nitrogen and vegetable sugars or atmospheric CO 2 as 
source of nitrogen and carbon (Pikaar et al. 2018; Simsa et al. 2019). 
Cultured meat is currently at the research stage and some challenges 
remain, such as the need for animal-based ingredients to ensure fast 
and effective growth of muscle cells; tissue engineering to create 
different meat products; production at scale and at competitive 
costs; and regulatory barriers (Post 2012; Stephens et al. 2018; Rubio 
et al. 2019; Tuomisto 2019; Post et al. 2020). Only a few studies to 
date have quantified the GHG emissions of microbial proteins or 
cultured meat, suggesting GHG emissions at the level of poultry meat 
(Tuomisto and Teixeira de Mattos 2011; Mattick et al. 2015; Souza 
Filho et al. 2019; Tuomisto 2019).
A review of LCA studies on different plant-based, animal source and 
nine ‘future food’ protein sources (Parodi et al. 2018) concluded that 
insects, macro-algae, mussels, mycoproteins and cultured meat show 
similar GHG intensities per unit of protein (mean values ranging 
0.3–3.1 kgCO 2-eq per 100 g protein), comparable to milk, eggs, and 
tuna (mean values ranging 1.2–5.4  kgCO 2-eq per 100 g  protein); 
while chlorella and spirulina consume more energy per unit of 
protein and were associated with higher GHG emissions (mean 
values ranging 11–13  kgCO 2-eq per 100 g  protein). As the main 
source of GHG emissions from insects and cellular agriculture foods 
is energy consumption, their GHG intensity improves with increased 
use of low-carbon energy (Smetana et al. 2015; Parodi et al. 2018; 
Pikaar et al. 2018).
Future foods offer other benefits such as lower land requirements, 
controlled systems with reduced losses of water and nutrients, 
increased resilience, and possibly reduced hazards from pesticide 
and antibiotics use and zoonotic diseases, although more research 
is needed including on allergenic and other safety aspects, and 
possibly reduced protein bioavailability (Alexander et al. 2017; 
Parodi et al. 2018; Stephens et al. 2018; Fasolin et al. 2019; Chriki 
and Hocquette 2020; Santo et al. 2020; Hadi and Brightwell 2021; 
Tzachor et al. 2021) (medium evidence, high agreement). Research 
is needed also on the effect of processing (Wickramasinghe et al. 
2021), though a randomised crossover trial comparing appetising 
plant foods with meat alternatives found several beneficial and no 
adverse effects from the consumption of the plant-based meats 
(Crimarco et al. 2020).
12.4.3.3 Food Processing and Packaging
Food processing includes preparation and preservation of fresh 
commodities (fruit and vegetables, meat, seafood and dairy 
products), grain milling, production of baked goods, and manufacture 
of pre-prepared foods and meals. Food processors range from small 
local operations to large multinational food producers, producing 
Chapter 12 Cross-sectoral Perspectives12food for local to global markets. The importance of food processing 
and preservation is particularly evident in developing countries 
which lack cold chains for the preservation and distribution of fresh 
perishable products such as fresh fish (Adeyeye and Oyewole 2016; 
Adeyeye 2017).
Mitigation in food processing largely focuses on reducing food waste 
and fossil energy usage during the processing itself, as well as in the 
transport, packaging and storage of food products for distribution 
and sale (Silva and Sanjuán 2019). Reducing food waste provides 
emissions savings by reducing wastage of primary inputs required 
for food production. Another mitigation route, contributing to the 
circular bioeconomy (Section  12.6.1.2 and Cross-Working Group 
Box  3  in this chapter), is by valorisation of food processing by-
products through recovery of nutrients and/or energy. No global 
analyses of the emissions savings potential from the processing step 
in the value chain could be found.
Reduced food waste during food processing can be achieved by 
seeking alternative processing routes (Atuonwu et al. 2018), improved 
communication along the food value chain (Göbel et al. 2015), 
optimisation of food processing facilities, reducing contamination, 
and limiting damages and spillage (HLPE 2014). Optimisation of food 
packaging also plays an important role in reducing food waste, in 
that it can extend product shelf life; protect against damage during 
transport and handling; prevent spoilage; facilitate easy opening and 
emptying; and communicate storage and preparation information to 
consumers (Molina-Besch et al. 2019).
Developments in smart packaging are increasingly contributing 
to reducing food waste along the food value chain. Strategies for 
reducing the environmental impact of packaging include using less, 
and more sustainable, materials and a shift to reusable packaging 
(Coelho et al. 2020). Active packaging increases shelf life through 
regulating the environment inside the packaging, including levels of 
oxygen, moisture and chemicals released as the food ages (Emanuel 
and Sandhu 2019). Intelligent packaging communicates information 
on the freshness of the food through indicator labels (Poyatos-
Racionero et al. 2018), and data carriers can store information on 
conditions such as temperature along the entire food chain (Müller 
and Schmid 2019).
LCA can be used to evaluate the benefits and trade-offs associated 
with different processing or packaging types (Silva and Sanjuán 
2019). Some options, such as aluminium, steel and glass, require 
high energy investment in manufacture when produced from primary 
materials, with significant savings in energy through recycling 
being possible (Camaratta et al. 2020). However, these materials 
are inert in landfill. Other packaging options, such as paper and 
biodegradable packaging, may require a  lower energy investment 
during manufacture, but may require larger land area and can release 
methane when consigned to anaerobic landfill where there is no 
methane recovery. Nevertheless, packaging accounts for only 1–12% 
(typically around 5%) of the GHG emissions in the lifecycle of a food 
system (Wohner et al. 2019; Crippa et al. 2021b), suggesting that 
its benefits can often outweigh the emissions associated with the 
packaging itself.The second component of mitigation in food processing relates to 
reduction in fossil energy use. Opportunities include energy efficiency 
in processes (also discussed in Section  11.3), the use of heat and 
electricity from low-carbon energy sources in processing (Chapter 6), 
through off-grid thermal processing (sun drying, food smoking) 
and improving logistics efficiencies. Energy-intensive processes 
with energy-saving potential include milling and refining (oil seeds, 
corn, sugar), drying, and food safety practices such as sterilisation 
and pasteurisation (Niles et al. 2018). Packaging also plays a role: 
reduced transport energy can be achieved through reducing the mass 
of goods transported and improving packing densities in transport 
vehicles (Lindh et al. 2016; Molina-Besch et al. 2019; Wohner 
et al. 2019). Choice of packaging also influences refrigeration energy 
requirements during transport and storage.
12.4.3.4 Storage and Distribution
Transport mitigation options along the supply chain include 
improved logistics, the use of alternative fuels and transport modes, 
and reduced transport distances. Logistics and alternative fuels and 
transport modes are discussed in Chapter  10. Transport emissions 
might increase with increasing demand for a diversity of foods as 
developing countries become more affluent. New technologies that 
enable food on demand or online food shopping systems might further 
increase emissions from food transport; however, the consequences 
are uncertain and might also entail a shift from individual traffic to 
bulk transport. The impact on food waste is also uncertain as more 
targeted delivery options could reduce food waste, but easier access 
to a wider range of food could also foster over-supply and increase 
food waste. Mitigation opportunities in food transport are inherently 
linked to decarbonisation of the transport sector (Chapter 10).
Retail and the food service industry are the main factors shaping the 
external food environment or ‘food entry points’; they are the ‘physical 
spaces where food is obtained; the built environment that allows 
consumers to access these spaces’ (HLPE 2017). These industries 
have significant influence on consumers’ choices and can play a role 
in reducing GHG emissions from food systems. Opportunities are 
available for optimisation of inventories in response to consumer 
demands through advanced IT systems (Niles et al. 2018), and for 
discounting foods close to sell-by dates, which can serve to reduce 
both food spoilage and wastage (Buisman et al. 2019).
As one of the highest contributors to energy demand at this stage 
in the food value chain, refrigeration has received a  strong focus 
in mitigation. Efficient refrigeration options include advanced 
refrigeration temperature control systems, and installation of 
more efficient refrigerators, air curtains and closed display fridges 
(Chaomuang et al. 2017). Also related to reducing emissions from 
cooling and refrigeration is the replacement of hydrofluorocarbons 
which have very high GWPs with lower GWP alternatives (Niles et al. 
2018). The use of propane, isobutane, ammonia, hydrofluoroolefins 
and CO 2 (refrigerant R744) are among those that are being explored, 
with varying success (McLinden et al. 2017). In recent years, due to 
restrictions on high GWP-refrigerants, a considerable growth in the 
market availability of appliances and systems with non-fluorinated 
refrigerants has been seen (Eckert et al. 2021).
Cross-sectoral Perspectives  Chapter 1212Energy efficiency alternatives generic to buildings more broadly are 
also relevant here, including efficient lighting, heating, ventilation, 
and air conditioning systems and building management, with 
ventilation being a  particularly high energy user in retail, that 
warrants attention (Kolokotroni et al. 2015).
In developing countries particularly, better infrastructure for 
transportation and expansion of processing and manufacturing 
industries can significantly reduce food losses, particularly of highly 
perishable food (Niles et al. 2018; FAO 2019a).12.4.4 Enabling Food System Transformation
Food system mitigation potentials in AFOLU are assessed in 
Section  7.4, and food system mitigation potentials linked to 
demand-side measures are assessed in Chapter  5. Studies 
suggest that implementing supply- and demand-side policies in 
combination makes ambitious mitigation targets easier to achieve 
(Clark et al.  2020; Global Panel on Agriculture and Food Systems 
for Nutrition 2020; Temme et al. 2020; Latka et al. 2021a) (high 
agreement, limited evidence).

Chapter 12 Cross-sectoral Perspectives12The trends in the global and national food systems towards 
a globalisation of food supply chains and increasing dominance of 
supermarkets and large corporate food processors (Dries et al. 2004; 
Neven and Reardon 2004; Baker and Friel 2016; Andam et al. 2018; 
Popkin and Reardon 2018; Reardon et al. 2019; Pereira et al. 2020) 
have led to environmental, food insecurity and malnutrition problems. 
Studies therefore call for a  transformation of current global and 
national food systems to solve these problems (Schösler and Boer 
2018; McBey et al. 2019; Kugelberg et al. 2021). This has not yet 
been successful, including due to insufficient coordination between 
relevant food system policies (Weber et al. 2020) (medium evidence, 
high agreement).
Different elements of food systems are currently governed by separate 
policy areas that in most countries scarcely interact or cooperate 
(Termeer et al. 2018; iPES Food 2019). This compartmentalisation 
makes the identification of synergetic and antagonistic effects 
difficult and faces the possibility of failure due to unintended 
and unanticipated negative impacts on other policy areas and 
consequently lack of agreement and social acceptance (Mylona 
et al. 2018; Brouwer et al. 2020; Mausch et al. 2020; Hebinck et al. 
2021) (Section 12.4.5). This could be overcome through cooperation 
across several policy areas (Sections 12.6.2 and 13.7), in particular 
agriculture, nutrition, health, trade, climate and environment, and an 
inclusive and transparent governance structure (Termeer et al. 2018; 
Bhunnoo 2019; Diercks et al. 2019; Herrero et al. 2021; iPES Food 
2019; Mausch et al. 2020; Kugelberg et al. 2021), making use of 
potential spillover effects (Kanter et al. 2020; OECD 2021).
Transformation of food systems may come from technological, social 
or institutional innovations that start as niches but can potentially 
lead to rapid changes, including changes in social conventions 
(Centola et al. 2018; Benton et al. 2019).
Where calories and ruminant animal-source food are consumed in 
excess of health guidelines, reduction of excess meat (and dairy) 
consumption is among the most effective measures to mitigate 
GHG emissions, with a high potential for environment, health, food 
security, biodiversity, and animal welfare co-benefits (Hedenus 
et al. 2014; Springmann et al. 2018a; Chai et al. 2019; Chen et al. 
2019; Kim et al. 2019; Willett et al. 2019; Semba et al. 2020; Theurl 
et al. 2020; Hamilton et al. 2021; Stylianou et al. 2021) (robust 
evidence, high agreement). Dietary changes are relevant for several 
SDGs, in addition to SDG 13 (climate action), including SDG 2 (zero 
hunger), SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 6 (clean water 
and sanitation), SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), 
SDG 14 (life below water) and SDG 15 (life on land) (Bruce M et al. 
2018; Mbow et al. 2019; Vanham et al. 2019; Herrero et al. 2021) 
(Section 12.6.1). However, behavioural change towards diets of lower 
environmental impact and higher nutritional qualities faces barriers 
both from agricultural producers and consumers (Apostolidis and 
McLeay 2016; Aiking and de Boer 2018; de Boer et al. 2018; Milford 
et al. 2019), and requires policy packages that combine informative 
instruments with behavioural, administrative and/or market-based 
instruments, and are attentive to the needs of, and engage, all food 
system stakeholders including civil society networks, and change 
the food environment (Cornelsen et al. 2015; Kraak et al. 2017;  Stoll-Kleemann and Schmidt 2017; El Bilali 2019; iPES Food 2019; 
Milford et al. 2019; Temme et al. 2020) (Section  12.4.1) (robust 
evidence, high agreement).
Table  12.9 summarises the implications of a  range of policy instruments 
discussed in more detail in the following sub-sections and highlights 
the benefits of integrated policy packages. Furthermore, Table 12.9 
assesses transformative potential, environmental effectiveness, 
feasibility, distributional effect, cost, and cost-benefits and trade-
offs of individual policy instruments, as well as their potential role as 
part of coherent policy packages. Table 12.9 shows that information 
and behavioural policy instruments can have significant but small 
effects in changing diets (robust evidence, medium agreement), but 
are mutually enforcing and might be essential to lower barriers and 
increase acceptance of market-based and administrative instruments 
(medium evidence, high agreement).
The policy instruments are assessed in relation to shifting food 
consumption and production towards increased sustainability and 
health. This includes lowering GHG emissions, although not in all 
cases is this the primary focus of the instrument, and in some cases 
lowering GHG emissions may not even be explicitly mentioned.
12.4.4.1 Market-based Instruments
Taxes and subsidies: Food-based taxes have largely been 
implemented to reduce non-communicable diseases and sugar intake, 
particularly those targeting sugar-sweetened beverages (WHO 2019). 
Many health-related organisations recommend the introduction of 
such taxes to improve the nutritional quality of marketed products 
and consumers’ diets (Wright et al. 2017; Park and Yu 2019; WHO 
2019), even though the impacts of food taxes are complex due to 
cross-price and substitution effects and supplier reactions (Cornelsen 
et al. 2015; Gren et al. 2019; Blakely et al. 2020) and can have 
a  regressive effect (WHO 2019). Subsidies and taxes are found to 
be effective in changing dietary behaviour at levels above 20% price 
increase (Cornelsen et al. 2015; Niebylski et al. 2015; Nakhimovsky 
et al. 2016; Hagenaars et al. 2017; Mozaffarian et al. 2018), even 
though longer-term effects are scarcely studied (Cornelsen et al. 
2015) and effects of sugar tax with tax rates lower than 20% have 
been observed for low-income groups (Temme et al. 2020).
Modelling results show only small consumption shifts with moderate 
meat price increases; and high price increases are required to reach 
mitigation targets, even though model predictions become highly 
uncertain due to lack of observational data (Mazzocchi 2017; 
Bonnet et al. 2018; Fellmann et al. 2018; Zech and Schneider 2019; 
Latka et al. 2021b). Taxes applied at the consumer level are found 
to be more effective than levying the taxes on the production side 
(Springmann et al. 2017).
Unilateral taxes on food with high GHG intensities have been 
shown to induce increases in net export flows, which could reduce 
global prices and increase global demand. Indirect effects on GHG 
mitigation therefore could be reduced by up to 70–90% of national 
results (Fellmann et al. 2018; Zech and Schneider 2019) (limited 
evidence, high agreement). The global mitigation potential for GHG 
Cross-sectoral Perspectives  Chapter 1212taxation of food products at USD52 kgCO 2-eq–1 has been estimated 
at 1 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 (Springmann et al. 2017).
Studies have shown that taxes can improve the nutritional quality of 
diets and reduce GHG emissions from the food system, particularly if 
accompanied by other policies that increase acceptance and elasticity, 
and reduce regressive and distributional problems (Niebylski et al. 2015; 
Hagenaars et al. 2017; Mazzocchi 2017; Springmann et al. 2017; Wright 
et al. 2017; Henderson et al. 2018; Säll 2018; FAO et al. 2020; Penne 
and Goedemé 2020) (robust evidence, high agreement) .
Trade: Since the middle of the last century, global trade in agricultural 
products has contributed to boosting productivity and reducing 
commodity prices, while also incentivising national subsidies for 
farmers to remain competitive in the global market (Benton et al. 
2019). Trade liberalisation has been coined as an essential element 
of sustainable food systems, and as one element required to achieve 
sustainable development, that can shift pressure to regions where 
the resources are less scarce (Wood et al. 2018; Traverso and Schiavo 
2020). However, Clapp (2017) argues that the main economic benefit 
of trade liberalisation flows to large transnational firms. Benton and 
Bailey (2019) argue that low food prices in the second half of last 
century contributed to both yield and food waste increases, and to 
a focus on staple crops to the disadvantage of nutrient-dense foods. 
However, global trade can also contribute to economic benefits such 
as jobs and income, reduce food insecurity and facilitate access to 
nutrients (Wood et al. 2018; Hoff et al. 2019; Traverso and Schiavo 
2020; Geyik et al. 2021) and has contributed to increased food 
supply diversity (Kummu et al. 2020). The relevance of trade for food 
security, and adaptation and mitigation of agricultural production, 
has also been discussed in Mbow et al. (2019).
Trade policies can be used to protect national food system measures, 
by requiring front-of-package labels, or to impose border taxes on 
unhealthy products (Thow and Nisbett 2019). For example, in the 
frame of the Pacific Obesity Prevention in Communities project, 
the Fijian government implemented three measures (out of seven 
proposed) that eliminated import duties on fruits and vegetables, 
and imposed 15% import duties on unhealthy oils (Latu et al. 
2018). Trade agreements, however, have the potential to undermine 
national efforts to improve public health (Unar-Munguía et al. 2019). 
GHG  mitigation efforts in food supply chains can be counteracted 
by GHG leakage, with a  general increase of environmental and 
social impact in developing countries exporting food products, and 
a  decrease in the developed countries importing food products 
(Fellmann et al. 2018; Sandström et al. 2018; Wiedmann and Lenzen 
2018). The demand for agricultural commodities has also been 
associated with tropical deforestation, though a robust estimate on 
the extent of embodied deforestation in food commodities is not 
available (Pendrill et al. 2019).
Investment into research and innovation: El Bilali (2019) assessed 
research gaps in the food system transition literature and found 
a need to develop comparative studies that enable the assessment 
of spatial variability and scalability of food system transitions. The 
author found also that the role of private industry and corporate business is scarcely researched, although they could play a major role 
in food system transitions.
The InterAcademy Partnership assessed how research can contribute 
to providing the required evidence and opportunities for food system 
transitions, with a focus on climate change impacts and mitigation 
(IAP 2018). The project builds on four regional assessments of 
opportunities and challenges on food and nutrition security in 
Africa (NASAC 2018), the Americas (IANAS 2018), Asia (AASSA 
2018), and Europe (EASAC 2017). The Partnership concludes with 
a  set of research questions around food systems, that need to be 
better understood: (i) how are sustainable food systems constituted 
in different contexts and at different scales? (ii) how can transition 
towards sustainable food systems be achieved? and (iii) how can 
success and failure be measured along sustainability dimensions 
including climate mitigation?
12.4.4.2 Regulatory and Administrative Instruments
Marketing regulations: Currently, 16 countries regulate marketing 
of unhealthy food to children, mainly on television and in schools 
(Taillie et al. 2019), and many other efforts are ongoing across the 
globe (European Commission 2019). The aim to counter the increase 
in obesity in children and target products high in saturated fats, 
trans-fatty acids, free sugars and/or salt (WHO 2010) was endorsed 
by 192 countries (Kovic et al. 2018). Nutrition and health claims for 
products are used by industry to increase sales, for example in the 
sport sector or for breakfast cereals. They can be informative, but can 
also be misleading if misused for promoting unhealthy food (Whalen 
et al. 2018; Ghosh and Sen 2019; Sussman et al. 2019).
Strong statutory marketing regulations can significantly reduce the 
exposure of children to, and sales of, unhealthy food compared 
with voluntary restrictions (Kovic et al. 2018; Temme et al. 2020). 
Data on effectiveness of marketing regulations with a broader food 
sustainability scope are not available. On the other hand, regulations 
that mobilise private investment into emerging food production 
technologies can be instrumental in curbing the cost and making 
them competitive (Bianchi et al. 2018a).
Voluntary sustainability standards: Voluntary sustainability 
standards are developed either by a  public entity or by private 
organisations to respond to consumers’ demands for social and 
environmental standards (Fiorini et al. 2019). For example, the Dutch 
Green Protein Alliance, an alliance of government, industry, NGOs and 
academia, formulated a goal to shift the ratio of protein consumption 
from 60% animal source proteins currently to 40% by 2050 (Aiking 
and de Boer 2020), and Cool Food Pledge signatories (organisations 
that serve food, such as restaurants, hospitals and universities) 
committed to a 25% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030, compared 
with 2015 (Cool Food 2020). For firms, obtaining certification under 
such schemes can be costly, and costs are generally borne by the 
producers and/or supply chain stakeholders (Fiorini et al. 2019). The 
effectiveness of private voluntary sustainability standards is uncertain. 
Cazzolla Gatti et al. (2019) have investigated the effectiveness of 
the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil on halting forest loss and 
Chapter 12 Cross-sectoral Perspectives12habitat degradation in Southeast Asia and concluded that production 
of certified palm oil continued to lead to deforestation.
Organisational procurement: Green public procurement is a policy 
that aims to create additional demand for sustainable products 
(Bergmann Madsen 2018; Mazzocchi and Marino 2019) or decrease 
demand for less sustainable products (e.g.,  the introduction of 
‘Meatless Monday’ by the Norwegian Armed Forces) (Cheng et al. 
2018; Gava et al. 2018; Milford and Kildal 2019; Wilts et al. 2019). 
To improve dietary choices, organisations can increase the price of 
unsustainable options while decreasing the price of sustainable ones, 
or employ information or choice architecture measures (Goggins and 
Rau 2016; Goggins 2018). Procurement guidelines exist at global, 
national, organisational or local levels (Noonan et al. 2013; Neto and 
Gama Caldas 2018). Procurement rules in schools or public canteens 
increase the accessibility of healthy food and can improve dietary 
behaviour and decrease purchases of unhealthy food (Cheng et al. 
2018; Temme et al. 2020).
Food regulations: Novel foods based on insects, microbial proteins 
or cellular agriculture must go through authorisation processes to 
ensure compliance with food safety standards before they can be 
sold to consumers. Several countries have ‘novel food’ regulations 
governing the approval of foods for human consumption. For 
example, the European Commission, in its update of the Novel Food 
Regulation in 2015, expanded its definition of novel food to include 
food from cell cultures, or that produced from animals by non-
traditional breeding techniques (EU 2015).
For animal product analogues, regulatory pathways and procedures 
(Stephens et al. 2018) and terminology issues (defining equivalence 
questions) (Carrenõ and Dolle 2018; Pisanello and Ferraris 2018) 
need clarification, as does their relation to religious rules (Chriki and 
Hocquette 2020).
Examples of legislation targeting food waste include the French 
ban on wasting food approaching best-before dates, requiring 
its donation to charity organisations (Global Alliance for the 
Future of Food 2020). In Japan, the Food Waste Recycling Law set 
targets for food waste recycling for industries in the food sector 
for 2020, ranging between 50% for restaurants and 95% for food 
manufacturers (Liu et al. 2016).
12.4.4.3 Informative Instruments.
Sustainable food-based dietary guidelines: National food-based 
dietary guidelines (FBDGs) provide science-based recommendations 
on food group consumption quantities. They are available for 94, mostly 
upper- and middle-income, countries globally (Wijesinha-Bettoni et al. 
2021), are adapted to national cultural and socio-economic context, 
and can be used as a benchmark for food formulation standards for 
public and private food procurement, or to inform citizens (Bechthold 
et al. 2018; Temme et al. 2020). Most FBDGs are based on health 
considerations and only a few mention environmental sustainability 
aspects (Bechthold et al. 2018; Ritchie et al. 2018; Ahmed et al. 2019; 
Springmann et al. 2020). Implementation of FBDGs so far focuses 
largely in the education and health sectors, with few countries also using their potential for guiding food system policies in other sectors 
(Wijesinha-Bettoni et al. 2021).
Despite the fact that 1.5 billion people follow a vegetarian diet from 
choice or necessity, and that the position statements of various 
nutrition societies point out that vegetarian diets are adequate if 
well planned, few FBDGs give recommendations for vegetarian diets 
(Costa Leite et al. 2020). An increase in consumption of plant-based 
food is a  recurring recommendation in FBDGs, though an explicit 
reduction or limit of animal-source proteins is not often included, 
with the exception of red or processed meat (Temme et al. 2020). 
To account for changing dietary trends, however, FBDGs need to 
incorporate sustainability aspects (Herforth et al. 2019). A  healthy 
diet respecting planetary boundaries has been proposed by Willett 
et al. (2019), though some authors have questioned the validity of the 
nutritional (Zagmutt et al. 2019) or environmental implications, such 
as water use (Vanham et al. 2020). In October 2019, 14 global cities 
pledged to adhere to this ‘planetary health diet’ (C40 Cities 2019).
Education on food/nutrition and environment: Some consumers 
are reluctant to adopt sustainable healthy dietary patterns because of  
a lack of awareness of the environmental and health consequences 
of what they eat, but also out of suspicion towards alternatives that 
are perceived as not ‘natural’ and that seem to be difficult to integrate 
into their daily dietary habits (Hartmann and Siegrist 2017; Stephens 
et al. 2018; McBey et al. 2019; Siegrist and Hartmann 2020) or simply 
lack of knowledge on how to prepare or eat unfamiliar foods (El Bilali 
2019; Aiking and de Boer 2020; Temme et al. 2020). Misconceptions 
may contribute, for example, to the belief that packaging or ‘food 
miles’ dominate the climate impact of food (Macdiarmid et al. 2016). 
However, spillover effects can induce sustainable behaviour from 
‘entry points’ such as concerns about food waste (El Bilali 2019). 
Early-life experiences are crucial determinants for adopting healthy 
and sustainable lifestyles (Bascopé et al. 2019; McBey et al. 2019), so 
improved understanding of sustainability aspects in the education of 
public health practitioners and in university education is proposed 
(Wegener et al. 2018). Investment in education, particularly of 
women (Vermeulen et al. 2020), might lower the barrier for stronger 
policies to be accepted and effective (McBey et al. 2019; Temme et al. 
2020) (medium evidence, high agreement).
Food labels: Instruments to improve transparency and information 
on food sustainability aspects are based on the assumption of the 
‘rational’ consumer. Information gives the necessary freedom of 
choice, but also the responsibility to make the ‘right choice’ (Kersh 
2015; Bucher et al. 2016). Studies find a lack of consumer awareness 
about the link between own food choices and environmental effect 
(Grebitus et al. 2016; Leach et al. 2016; Hartmann and Siegrist 2017; 
de Boer et al. 2018) and so effective messaging is required to raise 
awareness and acceptance of potentially stricter food system policies.
Back-of-package labels usually provide detailed nutritional 
information (Temple 2019). Front-of-package labels simplify and 
interpret the information: for example, the traffic light system or 
the Nutri-Score label used in France (Kanter et al. 2018b) and the 
health star rating used in Australia and New Zealand (Shahid et al. 
2020) provide an aggregate rating based on product attributes such 
Cross-sectoral Perspectives  Chapter 1212as energy, sugar, saturated fat and fibre content; other labels warn 
against frequent consumption (e.g., in the 1990s Finland introduced 
a  mandatory warning for products high in salt; the keyhole label 
was introduced in Sweden in 1989 (Storcksdieck genannt Bonsmann 
et al. 2020); and ‘high in’ (energy/saturated fat/sugar) labels were 
introduced in Chile in 2016 to reduce obesity (Corvalán et al. 2019)). 
Front-of-package labels serve also as an incentive to industry to 
produce healthier or more sustainable products, or can serve as 
a marketing strategy (Van Loo et al. 2014; Apostolidis and McLeay 
2016; Kanter et al. 2018b). Carbon footprint labels can be difficult 
for consumers to understand (Hyland et al. 2017), and simple, 
interpretative summary indicators used on front-of-package labels 
(e.g.,  traffic lights) are more effective than more complex ones 
(Bauer and Reisch 2019; Ikonen et al. 2019; Temple 2019; Tørris and 
Mobekk 2019) (robust evidence, high agreement). Reviews find 
mixed results but overall a positive effect of food labels in improving 
direct purchasing decisions (Hieke and Harris 2016; Sarink et al. 2016; 
Anastasiou et al. 2019; Shangguan et al. 2019; Temple 2019), and 
in raising levels of awareness, thus possibly increasing success of 
other policy instruments (Apostolidis and McLeay 2016; Samant and 
Seo 2016; Al-Khudairy et al. 2019; Miller et al. 2019; Temple 2019) 
(medium evidence, high agreement).
12.4.4.4 Behavioural Instruments
Choice architecture: Information is more effective if accompanied 
by reinforcement through structural changes or by changing the food 
environment, such as through product placement in supermarkets, 
to overcome the intention–behaviour gap (Bucher et al. 2016; 
Broers et al. 2017; Tørris and Mobekk 2019). Behavioural change 
strategies have also been shown to improve efficiencies of school 
food programmes (Marcano-Olivier et al. 2020).
Environmental considerations rank behind financial, health, or sensory 
factors for determining citizens’ food choices (Leach et al. 2016; 
Hartmann and Siegrist 2017; Neff et al. 2018; Rose 2018; Gustafson 
et al. 2019). There is evidence that choice architecture (‘nudging’) can 
be effective in influencing purchase decisions, but regulators do not 
normally explore this option (Broers et al. 2017). Examples of green 
nudging include making the sustainable option the default option, 
enhancing visibility, accessibility of, or exposure to, sustainable 
products and reducing visibility and accessibility of unsustainable 
products, or increasing the salience of healthy sustainable choices 
through social norms or food labels (Bucher et al. 2016; Wilson et al. 
2016; Broers et al. 2017; Al-Khudairy et al. 2019; Bauer and Reisch 
2019; Ferrari et al. 2019; Weinrich and Elshiewy 2019; Cialdini and 
Jacobson 2021). Available evidence suggests that choice architecture 
measures are relatively inexpensive and easy to implement (Ferrari 
et al. 2019; Tørris and Mobekk 2019), they are a preferred solution 
if a restriction of choices is to be avoided (Wilson et al. 2016; Kraak 
et al. 2017; Vecchio and Cavallo 2019), and can be effective (Arno 
and Thomas 2016; Bucher et al. 2016; Bianchi et al. 2018b; Cadario 
and Chandon 2018) if embedded in policy packages (Wilson et al. 
2016; Tørris and Mobekk 2019) (medium evidence, high agreement).
Choice architecture measures are also facilitated by growing market 
shares of animal-free protein sources taken up by discount chains and fast food companies, that enhance visibility of new products 
and ease integration into daily life for consumers, particularly if 
sustainable products are similar to the products they substitute 
(Slade 2018). This effect can be further increased by media and role 
models (Elgaaied-Gambier et al. 2018).
12.4.5 Food Systems Governance
To support the policies outlined in Section  12.4.4, food system 
governance depends on the cooperation of actors across traditional 
sectors in several policy areas, in particular agriculture, nutrition, 
health, trade, climate, and environment (Termeer et al. 2018; Bhunnoo 
2019; Diercks et al. 2019; iPES Food 2019; Rosenzweig et al. 2020b). 
Top-down integration, mandatory mainstreaming, or boundary-
spanning structures like public-private partnerships may be introduced 
to promote coordination (Termeer et al. 2018). ‘Flow-centric’ rather 
than territory-centric governance combined with private governance 
mechanisms has enabled codes of conduct and certification schemes 
(Eakin et al. 2017), for example the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm 
Oil (RSPO), as well as commodity chain transparency initiatives and 
platforms like Trase (Meijaard et al. 2020; Pirard et al. 2020). Trade 
agreements are an emerging arena of governance in which improving 
GHG performance may be an objective, and trade agreements can 
involve sustainability assessments.
Research on food system governance is mostly non-empirical or case 
study based, which means that there is limited understanding of 
which governance arrangements work in specific social and ecological 
contexts to produce particular food system outcomes (Delaney et al. 
2018). Research has identified a  number of desirable attributes in 
food systems governance, including adaptive governance (Termeer 
et al. 2018), a systems perspective (Whitfield et al. 2018), governance 
that considers food system resilience (Ericksen 2008; Moragues-
Faus et al. 2017; Meyer 2020), transparency, participation of civil 
society (Candel 2014; Duncan 2015;), and cross-scale governance 
(Moragues-Faus et al. 2017).
Food systems governance has multiple targets and objectives, not 
least contributing to the achievement of the SDGs. GHG emissions 
from food systems can be impacted by both interventions targeted at 
different parts of the food system and interventions in other systems, 
such as reducing deforestation or promoting reforestation (Lee 
et al. 2019). For example, policies targeting health can contribute 
to diet shifts away from red meat, while also influencing GHG 
emissions (Springmann et al. 2018b; Semba et al. 2020); national 
and local food self-sufficiency policies may also have GHG impacts 
(Kriewald et al. 2019; Loon et al. 2019). Cross-sectoral governance 
could enhance synergies between reduced GHG emissions from food 
systems and other goals; however, integrative paradigms for cross-
sectoral governance between food and other sectors have faced 
implementation challenges (Delaney et al. 2018). For example, in the 
late 2000s, the water-energy-food nexus emerged as a framework 
for cross-sectoral governance, but has not been well integrated into 
policy (Urbinatti et al. 2020), perhaps because of perceptions that it 
is an academic concept, or that it takes a technical-administrative 
view of governance; simply adopting the paradigm is not sufficient 
Chapter 12 Cross-sectoral Perspectives12to develop effective nexus governance (Cairns and Krzywoszynska 
2016; Weitz et al. 2017; Pahl-Wostl et al. 2018). Other policy 
paradigms and theoretical frameworks that aim to integrate 
food systems governance include system transition, agroecology, 
multifunctionality in agriculture (Andrée et al. 2018), climate-smart 
agriculture (Taylor 2018) and the circular economy (Box 12.4). Cross-
sectoral coordination on food systems and climate governance 
could be aided by internal recognition and ownership by agencies, 
dedicated budgets for cross-sectoral projects, and consistency in 
budgets (Pardoe et al. 2018) (Boxes 12.1 and 12.2).
Food systems governance is still fragmented at national levels, 
which means that there may be a proliferation of efforts that cannot 
be scaled and are ineffective (Candel 2014). National policies can be 
complemented or possibly pioneered by initiatives at the local level 
(de Boer et al. 2018; Rose 2018). The city-region has been proposed 
as a useful focus for food system governance (Vermeulen et al. 2020); 
for example, the Milan Urban Food Policy Pact involves 180 global 
cities committed to integrative food system strategies (Candel 2019; 
Moragues-Faus 2021). Local food policy groups and councils that 
assemble stakeholders from government, civil society, and the private 
sector have formed trans-local networks of place-based local food 
policy groups, with over two hundred food policy councils worldwide 
(Andrée et al. 2018). However, the fluidity and lack of clear agendas and membership structures may hinder their ability to confront 
fundamental structural issues like unsustainable diets or inequities in 
food access (Santo and Moragues-Faus 2019).
Early characterisations of food systems governance featured a binary 
distinction between global and local scales, but this has been 
replaced by a relational approach where the local governance is seen 
as a process that relies on the interconnections between scales (Lever 
et al. 2019). Cross-scalar governance is not simply an aggregation 
of local groups, but involves the telecoupling of distant systems; for 
example, transnational NGO networks have been able to link coffee 
retailers in the global North with producers in the global South via 
international NGOs concerned about deforestation and social justice 
(Eakin et al. 2017). Global governance institutions like the Committee 
on World Food Security can promote policy coherence globally and 
reinforce accountability at all levels (McKeon 2015), as can norm-
setting efforts like the Voluntary Guidelines for the Responsible 
Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests (FAO 2012). 
Global multi-stakeholder processes like the UN Food Systems Summit 
can foster the development of principles for guiding further actions 
based on sound scientific evidence. The European Commission’s Farm 
to Fork strategy aims to promote policy coherence in food policy at 
EU and national levels, and could be the exemplar of a  genuinely 
integrated food policy (Schebesta and Candel 2020).
Box 12.2 | Case Study: The Finnish Food2030 Strategy
Until 2016, the strategic goals of Finnish food policy were split between different programmes and ministries, resulting in fragmented 
national oversight of the Finnish food system. To enable policy coordination, a national food strategy was adopted in 2017 called 
Food2030 (Government of Finland 2017). Food2030 embodies a holistic food system approach and addresses multiple outcomes of 
the food system, including the competitiveness of the food supply chain and the development of local, organic and climate-friendly 
food production, as well as responsible and sustainable consumption.
The specific policy mix covers a  range of policy instruments to enable changes in agro-food supply, processing and societal norms 
(Kugelberg et al. 2021). The government provides targeted funding and knowledge support to drive technological innovations on climate 
solutions to reduce emissions from food and in the agriculture, forestry and land use sectors. In addition, the Finnish government applies 
administrative means, such as legislation, advice, guidance on public procurement and support schemes to diversify and increase organic 
food production to 20% of arable land, which in turn improve the opportunities for small-scale food production and steer public bodies 
to purchase local and organic food. The Finnish government applies educational and informative instruments to enable a shift to healthy 
and sustainable dietary behaviours. The policy objective is to reduce consumption of meat and replace it with other sources of protein, 
aligned with nutrition recommendations and avoiding food waste. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, in collaboration with the 
Finnish Farmer’s unions and the Union of Swedish-speaking Farmers and Forest Owners in Finland, ran a two-year multi-media campaign 
in 2018 with key messages on the sustainability, traceability and safety of locally-produced food (Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry 
2021). A ’Food Facts’ website project (Luke 2021), funded by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in collaboration with the Natural 
Resources Institute Finland and the Finnish Food Safety Authority, helps to raise knowledge about food, which could shape responsible 
individual food behaviour, for example choosing local and sustainable foods and reducing food waste.
A critical enabler for developing a shared food system strategy across sectors and political party boundaries was the implementation 
of a one-year inclusive, deliberative and consensual stakeholder engagement process. A wide range of stakeholders could exert real 
influence during the vision-building process, resulting in strong agreement on key policy objectives, and subsequently an important 
leverage point to policy change (Kugelberg et al. 2021). Moreover, cross-sectoral coordination of Food2030 and the government’s 
wider climate action programmes are enabled by a number of institutional mechanisms and collaborative structures, for example the 
advisory board for the food chain, formally established during the agenda-setting stage of Food2030, inter-ministerial committees 
to guide and assess policy implementation, and Our Common Dining Table, a multi-stakeholder partnership that assembles 18 food 
system actors to engage in reflexive discussions about the Finnish food system.
Cross-sectoral Perspectives  Chapter 121212.5 Land-related Impacts, Risks 
and Opportunities Associated 
with Mitigation Options
12.5.1 Introduction
This section provides a cross-sectoral perspective on land occupation 
and related impacts, risks and opportunities associated with land-
based mitigation options, as well as mitigation options that are not 
designated land-based, yet occupy land. It builds on Chapter 7, which 
covers mitigation in agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU, 
including future availability of biomass resources for mitigation in 
other sectors. It complements Section 12.4, which covers mitigation 
inherent in the food system, as well as Chapters  6, 9, 10 and 11, 
which cover mitigation in the energy, transport, building and industry 
sectors, and Chapters 3 and 4 which cover land and biomass use, 
primarily in energy applications, in mitigation and development 
pathways in the near- to mid-term (Chapter  4) and in pathways 
compatible with long-term goals (Chapter 3).
The deployment of climate change mitigation options often affects 
land and water conditions, and ecosystem capacity to support 
biodiversity and a range of ecosystem services (IPCC 2019a; IPBES 
2019) (robust evidence, high agreement). It can increase or decrease 
terrestrial carbon stocks and sink strength, hence impacting the 
mitigation effect positively or negatively. As for any other land uses, 
impacts, risks and opportunities associated with mitigation options 
that occupy land depend on deployment strategy and on contextual 
factors that vary geographically and over time (Doelman et al. 2018; 
Hurlbert et al. 2019; Smith et al. 2019a; Wu et al. 2020) (robust 
evidence, high agreement).
The IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5) found 
that large areas may be utilised for A/R and energy crops in modelled 
pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C (Rogelj et al. 2018). The SRCCL 
investigated the implications of land-based mitigation measures for 
land degradation, food security and climate change adaptation. It 
focused on identification of synergies and trade-offs associated with 
individual land-based mitigation measures (Smith et al. 2019b). 
In this section we expand beyond the scope of the Special Report 
on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL) assessment to include also mitigation measures that occupy land while not being considered 
land-based measures, we discuss ways to minimise potential 
adverse effects, and we consider the potential for synergies through 
integrating mitigation measures with other land uses, by applying 
a systems perspective that seeks to meet multiple objectives from 
multi-functional landscapes. Mitigation measures with zero land 
occupation, e.g., offshore wind and kelp farming, are not considered.
12.5.2 Land Occupation Associated with Different 
Mitigation Options
As reported in Chapter  3, in scenarios limiting warming to 1.5°C 
(>50%) with no or limited overshoot, median area dedicated for 
energy crops in 2050 is 1.99 (0.56 to 4.82) million square kilometres 
(Mkm2) and median forest area increased 3.22 (–0.67 to 8.90) Mkm2 
in the period 2019 to 2050 (5–95th percentile range, scenario category 
C1). For comparison, the total global areas of forests, cropland and 
pasture (in 2015) are in the SRCCL estimated at about 40 Mkm2, 
15.6 Mkm2, and 27.3 Mkm2, respectively (additionally, 21 Mkm2 of 
savannahs and shrublands are also used for grazing) (IPCC 2019a). 
The SRCCL concluded that conversion of land for A/R and bioenergy 
crops at the scale commonly found in pathways limiting warming to 
1.5°C or 2°C is associated with multiple feasibility and sustainability 
constraints, including land carbon losses (high confidence). Pathways 
in which warming exceeds 1.5°C require less land-based mitigation, 
but the impacts of higher temperatures on regional climate and 
land, including land degradation, desertification, and food insecurity, 
become more severe (Smith et al. 2019b).
Depending on emissions-reduction targets, the portfolio of mitigation 
options chosen, and the policies developed to support their 
implementation, different land-use pathways can arise with large 
differences in resulting agricultural and forest area. Some response 
options can be more effective when applied together (Smith et al. 
2019b); for example, dietary change, efficiency increases, and reduced 
wastage can reduce emissions as well as the pressure on land resources, 
potentially enabling additional land-based mitigation such as A/R and 
cultivation of biomass crops for biochar, bioenergy and other bio-based 
products. The SRCCL (Smith et al. 2019b) report that dietary change 
combined with reduction in food loss and waste can reduce the land Box 12.2 (continued)
Critical barriers to strategy and policy formulation include a lack of attention to integrated impact assessments (Kugelberg et al. 2021), 
which blurs a transparent overview of potential trade-offs and hidden conflicts. There were few policy evaluations from independent 
organisations to inform policymaking, reducing the opportunities for more progressive policy approaches. Monitoring and food policy 
evaluation is very close to the ministry in charge, which hampers critical thinking about policy measures (Hildén et al. 2014). In 
addition, there is a lack of standardised indicators covering the whole food system, which hinders comprehensive oversight of progress 
towards a sustainable food system (Kanter et al. 2018a). Some of the problems related to monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) 
are typical for countries in the EU. To improve, MRV will probably require structural changes, such as efforts to build up institutional 
capacity and application of new technology, development of standardised indicators covering the whole food system, regulations 
on transparency and verification, and mechanisms to enable reflexive discussions between business, farmers, public, NGOs and the 
government (Meadowcroft and Steurer 2018; Kanter et al. 2020).
Chapter 12 Cross-sectoral Perspectives12requirement for food production by up to 5.8 Mkm2 (0.8–2.4 Mkm2 
for dietary change; about 2 Mkm2 for reduced post-harvest losses, and 
1.4 Mkm2 for reduced food waste) (Parodi et al. 2018; Springmann et al. 
2018; Clark et al. 2020; Rosenzweig et al. 2020b) (Sections 7.4 and 
12.4). Stronger mitigation action in the near term targeting non-CO 2 
emissions reduction and deployment of other CDR options (DACCS, 
enhanced weathering, ocean-based approaches; see Section 12.3) can 
reduce the land requirement for land-based mitigation (Obersteiner 
et al. 2018; van Vuuren et al. 2018).
Global integrated assessment models (IAMs) provide insights into 
the roles of land-based mitigation in pathways limiting warming to 
1.5°C or 2°C; interaction between land-based and other mitigation 
options such as wind and solar power; influence of land-based 
mitigation on food markets, land use and land carbon; and the role 
of BECCS vis-à-vis other CDR options (Chapter 3). However, IAMs do 
not capture more subtle changes in land management and in the 
associated industrial/energy systems due to relatively coarse temporal 
and spatial resolution, and limited representation of land quality and 
feedstocks/management practices, interactions between biomass 
production and conversion systems, and local context, for example, 
governance of land use (Daioglou et al. 2019; Rose et al. 2020; Welfle 
et al. 2020; Calvin et al. 2021). A/R have generally been modelled as 
forests managed for carbon sequestration alone, rather than forestry 
providing both carbon sequestration and biomass supply (Calvin et al. 
2021). Because IAMs do not include options to integrate new biomass 
production with existing agricultural and forestry systems (Paré et al. 
2016; Mansuy et al. 2018; Cossel et al. 2019; Braghiroli and Passarini 
2020; Djomo et al. 2020; Moreira et al. 2020; Strapasson et al. 2020; 
Rinke Dias de Souza et al. 2021), they may over-estimate the total 
additional land area required for biomass production. On the other 
hand, some integrated biomass production systems may prove less 
attractive to landholders than growing biomass crops in large blocks, 
from logistic, economic, or other points of view (Ssegane et al. 2016; 
Busch 2017; Ferrarini et al. 2017).
Land occupation associated with mitigation options other than A/R 
and bioenergy is rarely quantified in global scenarios. Stressing 
large uncertainties (e.g.,  type of biomass used and share of solar 
PV integrated in buildings), Luderer et al. (2019) modelled land 
occupation and land transformation associated with a  range of 
alternative power system decarbonisation pathways in the context 
of a  global 2°C climate stabilisation effort. On a  per-megawatt 
hour (MWh) basis, bioelectricity with CCS was most land intensive, 
followed by hydropower, coal with CCS, and concentrated solar 
power (CSP), which in turn were around five times as land-intensive 
as wind and solar photovoltaics (PV). A review of studies of power 
densities (electricity generation per unit land area) confirmed the 
relatively larger land occupation associated with biopower, although 
hydropower overlaps with biopower (van Zalk and Behrens 2018). 
This study also quantifies the low land occupation of nuclear energy, 
similar to fossil energy sources.
The land occupation of PV depends on the share of ground-mounted 
versus buildings-integrated PV, the latter assumed to reach 75% 
share by 2050 (Luderer et al. 2019). van de Ven et al. (2021) assumed 
a  3% share of urbanised land in 2050 available for rooftop PV; Capellán-Pérez et al. (2017) and Dupont et al. (2020) report 2–3% 
availability of urbanised surface area, when considering factors 
such as roof slopes and shadows between buildings, and threshold 
relating to energy return on investment. Land occupation of solar 
technologies is considered to be underestimated in studies assuming 
ideal conditions, with real occupation being five to ten times higher 
(De Castro et al. 2013; MacKay 2013; Ong et al. 2013; Smil 2015; 
Capellán-Pérez et al. 2017).
Production of hydrogen and synthetic hydrocarbon fuels via 
electrolysis and hydrocarbon synthesis is subject to conversion losses 
that vary depending on technology, system integration and source 
of carbon (Wulf et al. 2020; Ince et al. 2021) (Sections 6.4.4.1 and 
6.4.5.1). Indicative electricity-to-hydrocarbon fuel efficiency loss is 
estimated at about 60% (Ueckerdt et al. 2021). The advantage of 
smaller land occupation for solar, wind, hydro and nuclear, compared 
with biomass-based options, is therefore smaller for hydrocarbon 
fuels than for electricity. Furthermore, biofuels are often co-produced 
with other bio-based products, which further reduces their land 
occupation, although comparisons are complicated by inconsistent 
approaches to allocating land occupation between co-products 
(Ahlgren et al. 2015; Czyrnek-Delêtre et al. 2017).
Note that comparisons on a  per-MWh basis do not reflect 
the GHG emissions associated with the power options, or that the 
different options serve different functions in power systems. 
Reservoir hydropower and biomass-based dispatchable power can 
complement other balancing options (e.g.,  battery storage, grid 
extensions and demand-side management (Göransson and Johnsson 
2018) (Chapter 6) to provide power stability and quality needed in 
power systems with large amounts of variable electricity generation 
from wind and solar power plants. Furthermore, the requirements of 
transport in grids, pipelines and so on differ. For example, electricity 
from buildings-integrated PV can be used in the same location as 
it is generated.
The character of land occupation, and, consequently, the associated 
impacts (Section 12.5.3), vary considerably among mitigation options 
and also for the same option depending on geographic location, 
scale, system design and deployment strategy (Olsson et al. 2019; 
Ioannidis and Koutsoyiannis 2020; van de Ven et al. 2021). Land 
occupation associated with different mitigation options can be large 
uniform areas (e.g., large solar farms, reservoir hydropower dams, or 
tree plantations), or more distributed, such as wind turbines, solar PV, 
and patches of biomass cultivation integrated with other land uses in 
heterogeneous landscapes (Cacho et al. 2018; Jager and Kreig 2018; 
Correa et al. 2019; Englund et al. 2020a). Studies with broader scope, 
covering total land use requirement induced by plant infrastructure, 
provide a  more complete picture of land footprints. For example, 
Wu et al. (2021) quantified a land footprint for the infrastructure of 
a pilot solar plant being three times the onsite land area. Sonter et al. 
(2020b) found significant overlap of mining areas (82% targeting 
materials needed for renewable energy production) and biodiversity 
conservation sites and priorities, suggesting that strategic planning 
is critical to address mining threats to biodiversity (Section 12.5.4) 
along with recycling and exploration of alternative technologies that 
use that use abundant minerals (Box 10.6).
Cross-sectoral Perspectives  Chapter 1212There are also situations where expanding mitigation is more 
or less decoupled from additional land use. The use of organic 
consumer waste, harvest residues and processing side-streams in 
the agriculture and forestry sectors can support significant volumes 
of bio-based products with relatively lower land-use change risks 
than dedicated biomass production systems (Hanssen et al. 2019; 
Spinelli et al. 2019; Mouratiadou et al. 2020). Such uses can provide 
waste management solutions while increasing the mitigation 
achieved from the land that is already used for agricultural and 
forest production. Bioenergy accounts for about 90% of renewable 
heat used in industrial applications, mainly in industries that can use 
their own biomass waste and residues, such as the pulp and paper 
industry, food industry, and ethanol production plants (IEA 2020c) 
(Chapters  6  and 11). Heat and electricity produced on-site from 
side-streams but not needed for the industrial processes can be sold 
to other users, such as district heating systems. Surplus waste and 
residues can also be used to produce solid and liquid biofuels, or 
be used as feedstock in other industries such as the petrochemical 
industry (IRENA 2018; Lock and Whittle 2018; Thunman et al. 2018; 
IRENA 2019; Haus et al. 2020) (Chapters 6 and 11). Electrification 
and improved process efficiencies can reduce GHG emissions and 
increase the share of harvested biomass that is used for production 
of bio-based products (Johnsson et al. 2019; Madeddu et al. 2020; 
Lipiäinen and Vakkilainen 2021; Rahnama Mobarakeh et al. 2021; 
Silva et al. 2021) (Chapter  11). Besides integrating solar thermal 
panels and solar PV into buildings and other infrastructure, floating 
solar PV panels in, for example, hydropower dams (Ranjbaran et al. 
2019; Cagle et al. 2020; Haas et al. 2020; Lee et al. 2020; Gonzalez 
Sanchez et al. 2021), and over canals (Lee et al. 2020; McKuin et al. 
2021) could decouple renewable energy generation from land use 
while simultaneously reducing evaporation losses and potentially 
mitigating aquatic weed growth and climate change impacts on 
water body temperature and stratification (Cagle et al. 2020; Exley 
et al. 2021; Gadzanku et al. 2021; Solomin et al. 2021).
12.5.3 Consequences of Land Occupation: 
Biophysical and Socio-economic Risks, 
Impacts and Opportunities
Land occupation associated with mitigation options can present 
challenges related to impacts and trade-offs, but can also provide 
opportunities and in different ways support the achievement of 
additional societal objectives, including adaptation to climate 
change. This section focuses on mitigation options that have 
significant risks, impacts and/or co-benefits with respect to land 
resources, food security and the environment. Bioenergy (with or 
without CCS), biochar and bio-based products require biomass 
feedstocks that can be obtained from purpose-grown crops, 
residues from conventional agriculture and forestry systems, or 
from biomass wastes, each with different implications for the land. 
Here we consider separately (i) ‘biomass-based systems’, including 
dedicated biomass crops (e.g.,  perennial grasses, short rotation 
woody crops) and biomass produced as a co-product of conventional 
agricultural production (e.g.,  maize stover), and (ii) ‘afforestation/
reforestation’, including forests established for ecological restoration 
and plantations grown for forest products and agroforestry, where biomass may also be a  co-product. We then discuss impacts and 
opportunities common to both systems, before considering impacts 
and opportunities associated with non-land-based mitigation options 
that nevertheless occupy land.
Biomass-based systems
Mitigation options that are based on the use of biomass, that is, 
bioenergy/BECCS, biochar, wood buildings, and other bio-based 
products, can have different positive and negative effects depending 
on the character of the mitigation option, the land use, the biomass 
conversion process, how the bio-based products are used and what 
other product they substitute (Leskinen et al. 2018; Howard et al. 2021; 
Myllyviita et al. 2021). The impacts of the same mitigation option can 
therefore vary significantly and the outcome in addition depends on 
previous land/biomass use (Cowie et al. 2021). As biomass-based 
systems commonly produce multiple food, material and energy 
products, it is difficult to disentangle impacts associated with individual 
bio-based products (Ahlgren et al. 2015; Djomo et al. 2017; Obydenkova 
et al. 2021). As for other mitigation options, governance has a critical 
influence on outcome, but larger scale and higher expansion rate 
generally translates into higher risk for negative outcomes such as 
competition for scarce land, freshwater and phosphorous resources, 
displacement of natural ecosystems, and diminishing capacity of 
agroecosystems to support biodiversity and essential ecosystem 
services, especially if produced without sustainable land management 
and in inappropriate contexts (Popp et al. 2017; Dooley and Kartha 
2018; Hasegawa et al. 2018; Heck et al. 2018; Humpenöder et al. 2018; 
Fujimori et al. 2019; Hurlbert et al. 2019; IPBES 2019; Smith et al. 
2019b; Drews et al. 2020; Hasegawa et al. 2020; Schulze et al. 2020; 
Stenzel et al. 2021) (medium evidence,  high agreement).
Removal of crop and forestry residues can cause land degradation 
through soil erosion and decline in nutrients and soil organic matter 
(Cherubin et al. 2018) (robust evidence, high agreement). These risks 
can be reduced by retaining a proportion of the residues to protect the 
soil surface from erosion and moisture loss and maintain or increase 
soil organic matter (Section  7.4.3.6); incorporating a  perennial 
groundcover into annual cropping systems (Moore et al. 2019); 
and by replacing nutrients removed, such as by applying ash from 
bioenergy combustion plants (Kludze et al. 2013; Harris et al. 2015; 
Warren Raffa et al. 2015; de Jong et al. 2017) while safeguarding 
against contamination risks (Pettersson et al. 2020) (medium 
evidence, high agreement). Besides topography, soil, and climate 
conditions, sustainable residue removal rates also depend on the fate 
of extracted biomass. For example, to maintain the same level of soil 
organic carbon, the harvest of straw, if used for combustion (which 
would return no carbon to fields), was estimated to be only 26% of the 
rate that could be extracted if used for anaerobic digestion involving 
return of recalcitrant carbon to fields (Hansen et al. 2020). Similarly, 
biomass pyrolysis produces biochar which can be returned to soils to 
counteract carbon losses associated with biomass extraction (Joseph 
et al. 2021; Lehmann et al. 2021).
Expansion of biomass crops, especially monocultures of exotic 
species, can pose risks to natural ecosystems and biodiversity through 
introduction of invasive species and land use change, also impacting 
Chapter 12 Cross-sectoral Perspectives12the mitigation value (robust evidence,  high agreement) (Liu et al. 2014; 
El Akkari et al. 2018). Cultivation of conventional oil, sugar, and starch 
crops tends to have larger negative impact than lignocellulosic crops 
(Núñez-Regueiro et al. 2020). Social and environmental outcomes can 
be enhanced through integration of suitable plants (such as perennial 
grasses and short rotation woody crops) into agricultural landscapes 
(within crop rotations or through strategic localisation, for example as 
contour belts, along fencelines and riparian buffers). Such integrated 
systems can provide shelter for livestock, retention of nutrients and 
sediment, erosion control, pollination, pest and disease control, and 
flood regulation (robust evidence,  high agreement) (Berndes et al. 
2008; Christen and Dalgaard 2013; Asbjornsen et al. 2014; Holland 
et al. 2015; Ssegane et al. 2015; Dauber and Miyake 2016; Milner et al. 
2016; Ssegane and Negri 2016; Styles et al. 2016; Zheng et al. 2016; 
Ferrarini et al. 2017; Crews et al. 2018; Henry et al. 2018a; Zalesny 
et al. 2019; Osorio et al. 2019; Englund et al. 2020b; Englund et al. 
2021) (Figure 12.8, Box 12.3, and Cross-Working Group Box 3 in this 
chapter). Many of the land use practices described above align with 
agroecology principles (AR6 WGII Section 5.14, AR6 WGII Box 5.11 
and AR6 WGII Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL) and can simultaneously 
contribute to climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation 
and reduced risk of land degradation (IPCC 2019a) (robust evidence, 
high agreement).
Afforestation/reforestation (A/R)
When A/R activities comprise the establishment of natural forests, 
the risk to land is primarily associated with potential displacement 
of previous land use to new locations, which could indirectly 
cause land-use change including deforestation (Sections 7.4.2 and 
7.6.2.4). A/R (including agroforestry) aimed at providing timber, fibre, 
biomass, non-timber resources and other ecosystem services can 
provide renewable resources to society and long-term livelihoods 
for communities. Forest management and harvesting regimes 
around the world will adjust in different ways as society seeks to 
meet climate goals. The outcome depends on forest type, climate, forest ownership and the character and product portfolio of the 
associated forest industry (Lauri et al. 2019; Favero et al. 2020). 
How forest carbon stocks, biodiversity, hydrology, and so on are 
affected by changes in forest management and harvesting in turn 
depends on both management practices and the characteristics of 
the forest ecosystems (Eales et al. 2018; Griscom et al. 2018; Kondo 
et al. 2018; Nieminen et al. 2018; Thom et al. 2018; Runting et al. 
2019; Tharammal et al. 2019) (robust evidence, medium agreement). 
As described above, the GHG savings achieved from producing and 
using bio-based products will in addition depend on the character 
of existing societal systems, including technical infrastructure and 
markets, as this determines the product substitution patterns.
Environmental and socio-economic co-benefits are enhanced when 
ecological restoration principles are applied (Gann et al. 2019) along 
with effective planning at landscape level and strong governance 
(Morgan et al., 2020). For example, restoration of natural vegetation 
and establishing plantations on degraded land enable organic 
matter to accumulate in the soil and have potential to deliver 
significant co-benefits for biodiversity, land resource condition 
and livelihoods (Box  12.3 and Cross-Working Group Box  3  in this 
chapter). Tree planting and agroforestry on cleared land can deliver 
biodiversity benefits (Seddon et al. 2009; Kavanagh and Stanton 
2012; Law et al. 2014), with biodiversity outcomes influenced by 
block size, configuration and species mix (Cunningham et al. 2015; 
Paul et al. 2016) (robust evidence, high agreement).
Risks and opportunities common to biomass production and A/R 
mitigation options
Biomass-based systems and A/R can contribute to addressing 
land degradation through land rehabilitation or restoration 
(Box  12.3). Land-based mitigation options that produce biomass 
for bioenergy/BECCS or biochar through land rehabilitation rather 
than land restoration imply a trade-off between production / carbon 
sequestration and biodiversity outcomes (Hua et al. 2016; Cowie 
Figure 12.8 | Overview of opportunities related to selected land-based climate change mitigation options.
Cross-sectoral Perspectives  Chapter 1212et al. 2018). Restoration, seeking to establish native vegetation with 
the aim to maximise ecosystem integrity, landscape connectivity, 
and conservation of on-ground carbon stock, will have higher 
biodiversity benefits than rehabilitation measures (Lin et al. 2013). 
However, sequestration rate declines as forests mature, and the 
sequestered carbon is vulnerable to loss through disturbance such as 
wildfire, so there is a higher risk of reversal of the mitigation benefit 
compared with use of biomass for substitution of fossil fuels and 
GHG-intensive building materials (Russell and Kumar 2017; Dugan 
et al. 2018; Anderegg et al. 2020). Trade-offs between different 
ecosystem services, and between societal objectives including 
climate change mitigation and adaptation, can be managed through 
integrated landscape approaches that aim to create a mosaic of land 
uses, including conservation, agriculture, forestry and settlements 
(Freeman et al. 2015; Nielsen 2016; Reed et al. 2016; Sayer et al. 
2017) where each is sited with consideration of land potential and 
socio-economic objectives and context (Cowie et al. 2018) (limited 
evidence, high agreement).
Impacts of biomass production and A/R on the hydrological cycle 
and water availability and quality depend on scale, location, 
previous land use/cover and type of biomass production system. 
For example, extraction of logging residues in forests managed for 
timber production has little effect on hydrological flows, while land-
use change to establish dedicated biomass production can have 
a significant effect (Teter et al. 2018; Drews et al. 2020). Deployment 
of A/R can affect temperature, albedo and precipitation locally and 
regionally, and can mitigate or enhance the effects of climate change 
in the affected areas (Stenzel et al. 2021b) (Section  7.2.4). A/R 
activities can increase evapotranspiration, impacting groundwater 
and downstream water availability, but can also result in increased 
infiltration to groundwater and improved water quality (Farley 
et al. 2005; Zhang et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2017; Lu et al. 2018) 
and can be beneficial where historical clearing has caused soil 
salinisation and stream salinity (Farrington and Salama 1996; Marcar 
2016). There is limited evidence that very large-scale land-use or 
vegetation cover changes can alter regional climate and precipitation 
patterns, for example downwind precipitation depends on upwind 
evapotranspiration from forests and other vegetation (Keys et al. 
2016; Ellison et al. 2017; van der Ent and Tuinenburg 2017).
Another example of beneficial effects includes perennial grasses 
and woody crops planted to intercept runoff and subsurface lateral 
flow, reducing nitrate entering groundwater and surface waterbodies 
(Femeena et al. 2018; Woodbury et al. 2018; Griffiths et al. 2019). In 
India, Garg et al. (2011) found desirable effects as a result of planting 
Jatropha on wastelands previously used for grazing (which could 
continue in the Jatropha plantations): soil evaporation was reduced, 
as a larger share of the rainfall was channelled to plant transpiration 
and groundwater recharge, and less runoff resulted in reduced soil 
erosion and improved downstream water conditions. Thus, adverse 
effects can be reduced and synergies achieved when plantings are 
sited carefully, with consideration of potential hydrological impacts 
(Davis et al. 2013).
Several biomass conversion technologies can generate co-benefits 
for land and water. Anaerobic digestion of organic wastes (e.g., food waste, manure) produces a nutrient-rich digestate and biogas that can 
be utilised for heating and cooking or upgraded for use in electricity 
generation, industrial processes, or as transportation fuel (Chapter 6) 
(Parsaee et al. 2019; Hamelin et al. 2021). The digestate is a rich source 
of nitrogen, phosphorus and other plant nutrients, and its application 
to farmland returns exported nutrients as well as carbon (Cowie 
2020b). Studies have identified potential risks, including manganese 
toxicity, copper and zinc contamination, and ammonia emissions, 
compared with application of undigested animal manure  (Nkoa 
2014). Although the anaerobic digestion process reduces pathogen 
risk compared with undigested manure feedstocks, it does not destroy 
all pathogens (Nag et al. 2019). Leakage of methane is a significant 
risk that needs to be managed, to ensure mitigation potential is 
achieved  (Bruun et al. 2014). Anaerobic digestion of wastewater, 
such as sugarcane vinasse, reduces methane emissions and pollution 
loading as well as producing biogas (Parsaee et al. 2019).
Biorefineries can convert biomass  to food, feed and biomaterials 
along with bioenergy  (Aristizábal-Marulanda and Cardona 
Alzate 2019; Schmidt et al. 2019).  Biorefinery plants are 
commonly  characterised  by high process integration to achieve 
high resource use efficiency, minimise waste production and energy 
requirements, and maintain flexibility  towards  changing markets 
for raw materials and products  (Schmidt et al. 2019). Emerging 
technologies can convert biomass that is indigestible for monogastric 
animals or humans (e.g., algae, grass, clover or alfalfa) into food and 
feed products. For example, lactic acid bacteria can facilitate the 
use of green plant biomass such as grasses and clover to produce 
a  protein concentrate suitable for animal feed and other products 
for material or energy use (Lübeck and Lübeck 2019). Selection of 
crops suitable for co-production of protein feed along with biofuels 
and other bio-based products can significantly reduce the land 
conversion pressure by reducing the need to cultivate other crops 
(e.g., soybean) for animal feed (Bentsen and Møller 2017; Solati et al. 
2018). Thus, such solutions, using alternatives to high-input, high-
emissions grain-based feed, can enable sustainable intensification of 
agricultural systems with reduced environmental impacts (Jørgensen 
and Lærke 2016). The use of seaweed and algae as biorefinery 
feedstock can facilitate recirculation of nutrients from waters to 
agricultural land, thus reducing eutrophication while substituting 
purpose-grown feed (Thomas et al. 2021).
Pyrolysis can convert organic wastes, including agricultural and 
forestry residues, food waste, manure, poultry litter and sewage 
sludge, into combustible gas and biochar, which can be used 
as a  soil amendment (Joseph et al. 2021; Schmidt et al. 2021) 
(Chapter  7). Pyrolysis facilitates nutrient recovery from biomass 
residues, enabling return to farmland as biochar, noting, however, 
that a large fraction of nitrogen is lost during pyrolysis (Joseph et al. 
2021). Conversion to biochar aids the logistics of transport and land 
application of materials such as sewage sludge, by reducing mass 
and volume, improving flow properties, stability and uniformity, 
and decreasing odour.  Pyrolysis is well suited for materials that 
may be contaminated with pathogens, microplastics, and per- and 
polyfluoroalkyl substances, such as abattoir and sewage wastes, 
removing these risks, and reduces availability of heavy metals in 
feedstock (Joseph et al. 2021). Applying biochar to soil sequesters 
Chapter 12 Cross-sectoral Perspectives12biochar-carbon for hundreds to thousands of years and can further 
increase soil carbon by reducing mineralisation of soil organic matter 
and newly added plant carbon (Singh et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2016a; 
Weng et al. 2017; Lehmann et al. 2021). Biochars can improve 
a  range of soil properties, but effects vary depending on biochar 
properties, which are determined by feedstock and production 
conditions (Singh et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2016a), and on the soil 
properties where biochar is applied (Razzaghi et al. 2020). Biochars 
can increase nutrient availability, reduce leaching losses (Singh et al. 
2010; Haider et al. 2017) and enhance crop yields, particularly in 
infertile acidic soils (Jeffery et al. 2017), thus supporting food security 
under changing climate. Biochars can enhance infiltration and soil 
water-holding capacity, reducing runoff and leaching, increasing 
water retention in the landscape and improving drought tolerance 
and resilience to climate change (Quin et al. 2014; Omondi et al. 
2016). (See Chapter 7 for a review of biochar’s potential contribution 
to climate change mitigation.)
Both A/R and dedicated biomass production could have adverse 
impacts on food security and cause indirect land-use change if 
deployed in locations used for food production (IPCC 2019a). But 
the degree of impact associated with a  certain mitigation option 
also depends on how deployment takes place and the rate and total 
scale of deployment. The highest increases in food insecurity due to 
deployment of land-based mitigation are expected to occur in sub-
Saharan Africa and Asia (Hasegawa et al. 2018). The land area that 
could be used for bioenergy or other land-based mitigation options 
with low to moderate risks to food security depends on patterns 
of socio-economic development, reaching limits between 1  and 

The use of less productive, degraded/marginal lands has received 
attention as an option for biomass production and other land-based 
mitigation that can improve the productive and adaptive capacity 
of the lands (Liu et al. 2017; Qin et al. 2018; Dias et al. 2021; Kreig 
et al. 2021) (Section 7.4.4 and Cross-Working Group Box 3 in this 
chapter). The potential is however uncertain as biomass growth rates 
may be low, a  variety of assessment approaches have been used, 
and the identification of degraded/marginal land as ‘available’ has 
been contested, as much low productivity land is used informally 
by impoverished communities, particularly for grazing, or may 
be economically infeasible or environmentally undesirable for 
development of energy crops (medium evidence, low agreement) 
(Baka 2013; Fritz et al. 2013; Haberl et al. 2013; Baka 2014).
As many of the SDGs are closely linked to land use, the identification 
and promotion of mitigation options that rely on land uses described 
above can support a  growing use of bio-based products while 
advancing several SDGs, such as SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 6 (clean 
water and sanitation), SDG  7  (affordable and clean energy) and 
SDG 15 (life on land) (Fritsche et al. 2017; IRP 2019; Blair et al. 2021). 
Policies supporting the target of Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) 
(SDG  15.3) encourage planning of measures to counteract loss of 
productive land due to unsustainable agricultural practices and land 
conversion, through sustainable land management and strategic 
restoration and rehabilitation of degraded land (Cowie et al. 2018). 
LDN can thus be an incentive for land-based mitigation measures that build carbon in vegetation and soil, and can provide impetus 
for land-use planning to achieve multifunctional landscapes that 
integrate land-based mitigation with other land uses (Box  12.3). 
The application of sustainable land management practices that build 
soil carbon will enhance the productivity and resilience of crop and 
forestry systems, thereby enhancing biomass production (Henry 
et al. 2018a). Non-bio-based mitigation options can enhance land-
based mitigation: (i) enhanced weathering, that is, adding ground 
silicate rock to soil to take up atmospheric CO 2 through chemical 
weathering (Section 12.3), could supply nutrients and alleviate soil 
acidity, thereby boosting productivity of biomass crops and A/R, 
particularly when combined with biochar application (Haque et al. 
2019; De Oliveira Garcia et al. 2020; Buss et al. 2021); and (ii) land 
rehabilitation and enhanced landscape diversity through production 
of biomass crops could simultaneously contribute to climate change 
mitigation, climate change adaptation, addressing land degradation, 
increasing biodiversity and improving food security in the longer 
term (Mackey et al. 2020) (Chapter 7).
Wind power
The land requirement and impacts (including visual and noise impacts) 
of onshore wind turbines depend on the size and type of installation, 
and location (Ioannidis and Koutsoyiannis 2020). Wind power and 
agriculture can coexist in beneficial ways and wind power production 
on agriculture land is well established (Fritsche et al. 2017; Miller and 
Keith 2018a). Spatial planning and local stakeholder engagement can 
reduce opposition due to visual landscape impacts and noise (Frolova 
et al. 2019; Hevia-Koch and Ladenburg 2019). Repowering, that is, 
replacing with higher capacity wind turbines, can mitigate additional 
land requirement associated with deployment towards higher share 
of wind in power systems (Pryor et al. 2020).
Mortality and disturbance risks to birds, bats and insects are major 
ecological concerns associated with wind farms (Thaxter et al. 
2017; Cook et al. 2018; Heuck et al. 2019; Coppes et al. 2020; Choi 
et al. 2020; Fernández-Bellon 2020; Marques et al. 2020; Voigt 2021). 
Careful siting is critical (May et al. 2021), while painting blades to 
increase the visibility can also reduce mortality due to collision (May 
et al. 2020). Theoretical studies have suggested that wind turbines 
could lead to warmer night temperatures due to atmospheric mixing 
(Keith et al. 2004), later confirmed through observation (Zhou et al. 
2013), although Vautard et al. (2014) found limited impact at scales 
consistent with climate policies. More recent studies report mixed 
results: indications that the warming effect could be substantial with 
widespread deployment (Miller and Keith 2018b) and conversely 
limited impacts on regional climate at 20% of US electricity from 
wind. (Pryor et al. 2020).
Solar power
As for wind power, land impacts of solar power depend on the 
location, size and type of installation (Ioannidis and Koutsoyiannis 
2020). Establishment of large-scale solar farms could have positive 
or negative environmental effects at the site of deployment, 
depending on the location. Solar PV and CSP power installations 
can lock away land areas, displacing other uses (Mohan 2017). Solar 
Cross-sectoral Perspectives  Chapter 1212PV can be deployed in ways that enhance agriculture: for example, 
Hassanpour Adeh et al. (2018) found that biomass production and 
water use efficiency of pasture increased under elevated solar 
panels. PV systems under development may achieve significant 
power generation without diminishing agricultural output (Miskin 
et al. 2019). Global mapping of solar panel efficiency showed that 
croplands, grasslands and wetlands are located in regions with the 
greatest solar PV potential (Adeh et al. 2019). Dual-use agrivoltaic 
systems are being developed that overcome previously recognised 
negative impact on crop growth, mainly due to shadows (Marrou et al. 
2013a; Marrou et al. 2013b; Armstrong et al. 2016), thus facilitating 
synergistic co-location of solar photovoltaic power and cropping 
(Adeh et al. 2019; Miskin et al. 2019). Assessment of the potential for 
optimising deployment of solar PV and energy crops on abandoned 
cropland areas produced an estimate of the technical potential for 
optimal combination at 125 EJ per year (Leirpoll et al. 2021).
Deserts can be well suited for solar PV and CSP farms, especially at 
low latitudes where global horizontal irradiance is high, as there is 
lower competition for land and land carbon loss is minimal, although 
remote locations may pose challenges for power distribution (Xu 
et al. 2016). Solar arrays can reduce the albedo, particularly in 
desert landscapes, which can lead to local temperature increases 
and regional impacts on wind patterns (Millstein and Menon 2011). 
Modelling studies suggest that large-scale wind and solar farms, for 
example in the Sahara (Li et al. 2018), could increase rainfall through 
reduced albedo and increased surface roughness, stimulating 
vegetation growth and further increasing regional rainfall (Li et al. 
2018) (limited evidence). Besides impacts at the site of deployment, 
wind and solar power affect land through mining of critical minerals 
required by these technologies (Viebahn et al. 2015; McLellan et al. 
2016; Carrara et al. 2020).
Nuclear power
Nuclear power has land impacts and risks associated with mining 
operations (Falck 2015; Winde et al. 2017; Srivastava et al. 2020) and 
disposal of spent fuel (IAEA 2006a; Ewing et al. 2016; Bruno et al. 
2020), but the land occupation is small compared to many other 
mitigation options. Substantial volumes of water are required for 
cooling (Liao et al. 2016), as for all thermal power plants, but most 
of this water is returned to rivers and other water bodies after use 
(Sesma Martín and Rubio-Varas 2017). Negative impacts on aquatic 
systems can occur due to chemical and thermal pollution loading 
(Fricko et al. 2016; Raptis et al. 2016; Bonansea et al. 2020). The major 
risk to land from nuclear power is that a nuclear accident leads to 
radioactive contamination. An extreme example, the 1986 Chernobyl 
accident in Ukraine, resulted in radioactive contamination across 
Europe. Most of the fallout concentrated in Belarus, Ukraine and 
Russia, where some 125,000 km2 of land (more than a third of which 
was in agricultural use) was contaminated. About 350,000 people 
were relocated away from these areas (IAEA 2006b; Sovacool 2008). 
About 116,000 people were permanently evacuated from the 4200 
km Chernobyl exclusion zone (IAEA 2006a). New reactor designs 
with passive and enhanced safety systems reduce the risk of such 
accidents significantly (Section 6.4.2.4). An example of alternatives 
to land reclamation for productive purposes, a  national biosphere reserve has been established around Chernobyl to conserve, enhance 
and manage carbon stocks and biodiversity (Deryabina et al. 2015; 
Ewing et al. 2016), although invertebrate and plant populations are 
affected (Mousseau and Møller 2014; Mousseau and Møller 2020).
Hydropower
Reservoir hydropower projects submerge areas as dams are 
established for water storage. Hydropower can be associated with 
significant and highly varying land occupation and carbon footprint 
(Poff and Schmidt 2016; Scherer and Pfister 2016a; dos Santos 
et al. 2017; Ocko and Hamburg 2019). The flooding of land causes 
CH4 emissions due to the anaerobic decomposition of submerged 
vegetation and there is also a  loss of carbon sequestration due 
to mortality of submerged vegetation. The size of GHG emissions 
depends on the amount of vegetation submerged. The carbon 
in accumulated sediments in reservoirs may be released to the 
atmosphere as CO 2 and CH 4 upon decommissioning of dams, and 
while uncertain, estimates indicate that these emissions can make up 
a significant part of the cumulative GHG emissions of hydroelectric 
power plants (Moran et al. 2018; Almeida et al. 2019; Ocko and 
Hamburg 2019). Positive radiative forcing due to lower albedo of 
hydropower reservoirs compared to surrounding landscapes can 
reduce mitigation contribution significantly (Wohlfahrt et al. 2021).
Hydropower can have high water usage due to evaporation from 
dams (Scherer and Pfister 2016b). Hydropower projects may impact 
aquatic ecology and biodiversity, necessitate the relocation of local 
communities living within or near the reservoir or construction 
sites, and affect downstream communities (in positive or negative 
ways) (Moran et al. 2018; Barbarossa et al. 2020). Displacement 
as well as resettlement schemes can have both socio-economic 
and environmental consequences including those associated with 
establishment of new agricultural land (Ahsan and Ahmad 2016; 
Nguyen et al. 2017). Dam construction may also stimulate migration 
into the affected region, which can lead to deforestation and other 
negative impacts (Chen et al. 2015). Impacts can be mitigated 
through basin-scale dam planning that considers GHG emissions 
along with social and ecological effects (Almeida et al. 2019). Land 
occupation is minimal for run-of-river hydropower installations, but 
without storage they have no resilience to drought and installations 
inhibit dispersal and migration of organisms (Lange et al. 2018). 
Reservoir hydropower schemes can regulate water flows and reduce 
flood damage to agricultural production (Amjath-Babu et al. 2019). 
On the other hand, severe flooding due to failure of hydropower 
dams has caused fatalities, damage to infrastructure and loss of 
productive land (Farrington and Salama 1996; Farley et al. 2005; 
Zhang et al. 2016; Marcar 2016; Zhang et al. 2017; Kalinina et al. 
2018; Lu et al. 2018).
12.5.4 Governance of Land-related Impacts 
of Mitigation Options
The land sector (Chapter 7) contributes to mitigation via emissions 
reduction and enhancement of land carbon sinks, and by providing 
biomass for mitigation in other sectors. Key challenges for governance 
Chapter 12 Cross-sectoral Perspectives12of land-based mitigation include social and environmental safeguards 
(Duchelle et al. 2017; Sills et al. 2017; Larson et al. 2018); insufficient 
financing (Turnhout et al. 2017); capturing co-benefits; ensuring 
additionality; addressing non-permanence of carbon sequestration; 
monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) of emissions reduction 
and carbon dioxide removals; and avoiding leakage or spillover 
effects. Governance approaches to addressing these challenges are 
discussed in Section  7.6, and include MRV systems and integrity 
criteria for project-level emissions trading; payments for ecosystem 
services; land-use planning and land zoning; certification schemes, 
standards and codes of practice.
With respect to renewable energy options that occupy land, the 
focus of governance has been directed to technological adoption 
and public acceptance (Sequeira and Santos 2018), rather than 
land use. Recent work has found that spatial processes shape the 
emerging energy transition, creating zones of friction between 
global investors, national and local governments, and civil society 
(Jepson and Caldas 2017; McEwan 2017). For example, Yenneti et 
al. (2016) have argued that hydropower and ground-based solar 
parks in India, which have involved enclosure of lands designated as 
degraded, displacing pastoral use by vulnerable communities, have 
constituted forms of spatial injustice. Hydropower leads to dam-
induced displacement, and though this can be addressed through 
compensation mechanisms, governance is complicated by a lack of 
transparency in resettlement data (Kirchherr et al. 2016; Kirchherr 
et al. 2019). Renewable energy production is resulting in new land 
conflict frontiers where degraded land is framed as having mitigation 
value such as for palm oil production and wind power in Mexico 
(Backhouse and Lehmann 2020); land use conflict as well as impacts 
on wildlife from large-scale solar installations have also emerged 
in the southwestern United States (Mulvaney 2017). The renewable 
energy transition also involves the extraction of critical minerals 
used in renewable energy technologies, such as lithium and cobalt. Governance challenges include the lack of transparent greenhouse 
gas accounting for mining activities (Lee et al. 2020a), and threats to 
biodiversity from land disturbance, which require strategic planning 
to address (Sonter et al. 2020a). Strategic spatial planning is 
needed more generally to address trade-offs between using land for 
renewable energy and food: for example, agriculture can be co-located 
with solar photovoltaics (Barron-Gafford et al. 2019) or wind power 
(Miller and Keith 2018a). Integrative spatial planning can integrate 
renewable energy with not just agriculture, but mobility and housing 
(Hurlbert et al. 2019). Integrated planning is needed to avoid scalar 
pitfalls, and local and regional contextualised governance solutions 
need to be sited within a  planetary frame of reference (Biermann 
et al. 2016). Greater planning and coordination are also needed to 
ensure co-benefits from land-based mitigation (Box 12.3) as well as 
from CDR and efforts to reduce food systems emissions.
In emerging domains for governance such as land-based mitigation, 
global institutions, private sector networks and civil society 
organisations are playing key roles in terms of norm-setting. The 
shared languages and theoretical frameworks, or cognitive linkages 
(Pattberg et al. 2018), that arise with polycentric governance can not 
only be helpful in creating expectations and establishing benchmarks 
for (in)appropriate practices where enforceable ‘hard law’ is missing 
(Karlsson-Vinkhuyzen et al. 2018; Gajevic Sayegh 2020), they 
can also form the basis of voluntary guidelines or niche markets 
(Box 12.3) However, the ability to apply participatory processes for 
developing voluntary guidelines and other participatory norm-setting 
endeavours varies from place to place. Social and cultural norms 
shape the ability of women, youth, and different ethnic groups to 
participate in governance fora, such as those around agroecological 
transformation (Anderson et al. 2019). Furthermore, establishing 
new norms alone does not solve structural challenges such as lack 
of access to food, nor does it confront power imbalances, or provide 
mechanisms to deal with uncooperative actors (Morrison et al. 2019).
Box 12.3 | Land Degradation Neutrality as a Framework to Manage Trade-offs  
in Land-based Mitigation
The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) introduced the concept of Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN), 
defined as ‘a state whereby the amount and quality of land resources necessary to support ecosystem functions and services and 
enhance food security remain stable or increase within specified temporal and spatial scales and ecosystems’ (UNCCD 2015), and it 
has been adopted as a target of SDG 15 (life on land). At December 2020, 124 (mostly developing) countries had committed to pursue 
voluntary LDN targets.
The goal of LDN is to maintain or enhance land-based natural capital, and its associated ecosystem services, such as provision 
of food and regulation of water and climate, while enhancing the resilience of the communities that depend on the land. LDN 
encourages a dual-pronged approach promoting sustainable land management (SLM) to avoid or reduce land degradation, combined 
with strategic effort in land restoration and rehabilitation to reverse degradation on degraded lands and thereby deliver the target of 
‘no net loss’ of productive land (Orr et al. 2017).
In the context of LDN, land restoration refers to actions undertaken with the aim of reinstating ecosystem functionality, whereas land 
rehabilitation refers to actions undertaken with a goal of provision of goods and services (Cowie et al. 2018). Restoration interventions 
can include destocking to encourage regeneration of native vegetation; shelter belts of local species established from seed or 
seedlings, strategically located to provide wildlife corridors and link habitat; and rewetting drained peatland. ‘Farmer-managed natural 
regeneration’ is a low-cost restoration approach in which regeneration of tree stumps and roots is encouraged, stabilising soil and

enhancing soil nutrients and organic matter levels (Chomba et al. 2020; Lohbeck et al. 2020). Rehabilitation actions include 
establishment of energy crops, or afforestation with fast-growing exotic trees to sequester carbon or produce timber. Application of 
biochar can facilitate rehabilitation by enhancing nutrient retention and water-holding capacity, and stimulating microbial activity 
(Cowie 2020a).
SLM, rehabilitation and restoration activities undertaken towards national LDN targets have potential to deliver substantial CDR 
through carbon sequestration in vegetation and soil. In addition, biomass production, for bioenergy or biochar, could be an economically 
viable land use option for reversing degradation, through rehabilitation. Alternatively, a focus on ecological restoration (Gann et al. 
2019) as the strategy for reversing degradation will deliver greater biodiversity benefits.
Achieving neutrality requires estimating the likely impacts of land-use and land-management decisions, to determine the area of land, 
of each land type, that is likely to be degraded (Orr et al. 2017). This information is used to plan interventions to reverse degradation on 
an equal area of the same land type. Therefore, pursuit of LDN requires concerted and coordinated efforts to integrate LDN objectives 
into land-use planning and land management, underpinned by sound understanding of the human–environment system and effective 
governance mechanisms.
Countries are advised to apply a landscape-scale approach for planning LDN interventions, in which land uses are matched to land 
potential, and resilience of current and proposed land uses is considered, to ensure that improvement in land condition is likely to 
be maintained (Cowie 2020a). A  participatory approach that enables effective representation of all stakeholders is encouraged, 
to facilitate equitable outcomes from planning decisions, recognising that decisions on LDN interventions are likely to involve trade-
offs between various environmental and socio-economic objectives (Schulze et al. 2021).
Planning and implementation of LDN programmes provides a framework in which locally-adapted land-based mitigation options 
can be integrated with use of land for production, conservation and settlements, in multifunctional landscapes where trade-offs 
are recognised and managed, and synergistic opportunities are sought. LDN is thus a vehicle to focus collaboration in pursuit of the 
multiple land-based objectives of the multilateral environmental agreements and the SDGs.

Summary statement
The growing demand for biomass offers both opportunities and challenges to mitigate and adapt to climate change and natural 
resource constraints (high confidence). Increased technology innovation, stakeholder integration and transparent governance 
structures and procedures at local to global scales are key to successful bioeconomy deployment maximising benefits and managing 
trade-offs (high confidence).
Limited global land and biomass resources accompanied by growing demands for food, feed, fibre, and fuels, together with prospects 
for a paradigm shift towards phasing out fossil fuels, set the frame for potentially fierce competition for land3 and biomass to meet 
burgeoning demands, even as climate change increasingly limits natural resource potentials (high confidence).

Sustainable agriculture and forestry, technology innovation in bio-based production within a circular economy, and international 
cooperation and governance of global trade in products to reflect and disincentivise their environmental and social externalities, can 
provide mitigation and adaptation via bioeconomy development that responds to the needs and perspectives of multiple stakeholders 
to achieve outcomes that maximise synergies while limiting trade-offs (high confidence).
Background
There is high confidence that climate change, population growth and changes in per capita consumption will increase pressures 
on managed as well as natural and semi-natural ecosystems, exacerbating existing risks to livelihoods, biodiversity, human and 
ecosystem health, infrastructure, and food systems (Conijn et al. 2018; IPCC 2018; IPCC 2019a; Lade et al. 2020). At the same time, 
many global mitigation scenarios presented in IPCC assessment reports rely on large GHG emissions reduction in the AFOLU sector 
and concurrent deployment of reforestation/afforestation and biomass use in a multitude of applications (Rogelj et al. 2018; Hanssen 
et al. 2020) (AR6 WGI Chapters 4 and 5, AR6 WGIII Chapters 3 and 7).
Given the finite availability of natural resources, there are invariably trade-offs that complicate land-based mitigation unless land 
productivity can be enhanced without undermining ecosystem services (Obersteiner et al. 2016; Campbell et al. 2017; Caron et al. 
2018; Conijn et al. 2018; Heck et al. 2018; Searchinger 2018a; Smith et al. 2019). Management intensities can often be adapted to local 
conditions with consideration of other functions and ecosystem services, but at a global scale the challenge remains to avoid further 
deforestation and degradation of intact ecosystems, in particular biodiversity-rich systems (AR6 WGII Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL), 
while meeting the growing demands. Further, increased land-use competition can affect food prices and impact food security and 
livelihoods (To and Grafton 2015; Chakravorty et al. 2017), with possible knock-on effects related to civil unrest (Abbott et al. 2017; 
D’Odorico et al. 2018).
Developing new bio-based solutions while mitigating overall biomass demand growth
Many existing bio-based products have significant mitigation potential. Increased use of wood in buildings can reduce GHG emissions 
from cement and steel production while providing carbon storage (Churkina et al. 2020). Substitution of fossil fuels with biomass in 
manufacture of cement and steel can reduce GHG emissions where these materials are difficult to replace. Dispatchable power based 
on biomass can provide power stability and quality as the contribution from solar and wind power increases (AR6 WGIII Chapter 6), 
and biofuels can contribute to reducing fossil fuel emissions in the transport and industry sectors (AR6 WGIII Chapters 10 and 11). 
The use of bio-based plastics, chemicals and packaging could be increased, and biorefineries can achieve high resource-use efficiency 
in converting biomass into food, feed, fuels and other bio-based products (Aristizábal-Marulanda and Cardona Alzate 2019; Schmidt 
et al. 2019). There is also scope for substituting existing bio-based products with more benign products. For example, cellulose-based 
textiles can replace cotton, which requires large amounts of water, chemical fertilisers and pesticides to ensure high yields.
While increasing and diversified use of biomass can reduce the need for fossil fuels and other GHG-intensive products, unfavourable 
GHG balances may limit the mitigation value. Growth in biomass use may in the longer term also be constrained by the need to protect 
biodiversity and ecosystems’ capacity to support essential ecosystem services. Biomass use may also be constrained by water scarcity 
and other resource scarcities, and/or challenges related to public perception and acceptance due to impacts caused by biomass 
production and use. Energy conservation and efficiency measures and deployment of technologies and systems that do not rely on 
carbon, such as carbon-free electricity supporting, inter alia, electrification of transport as well as industry processes and residential 
heating (IPCC 2018; UNEP 2019), can constrain the growth in biomass demand when countries seek to phase out fossil fuels and 
other GHG-intensive products while providing an acceptable standard of living. Nevertheless, demand for bio-based products may 
become high where full decoupling from carbon is difficult to achieve (e.g., aviation, bio-based plastics and chemicals) or where 
carbon storage is an associated benefit (e.g., wood buildings, BECCS, biochar for soil amendments), leading to challenging trade-offs 
(e.g., food security, biodiversity) that need to be managed in environmentally sustainable and socially just ways.
Changes on the demand side as well as improvements in resource-use efficiencies within the global food and other bio-based systems 
can also reduce pressures on the remaining land resources. For example, dietary changes toward more plant-based food (where 
appropriate) and reduced food waste can provide climate change mitigation along with health benefits (Willett et al. 2019) (AR6 WGIII 
Sections 7.4 and 12.4) and other co-benefits with regard to food security, adaptation and land use (Mbow et al. 2019; Smith et al. 
2019a) (AR6 WGII Chapter 5). Advancements in the provision of novel food and feed sources (e.g., cultured meat, insects, grass-based 
protein feed and cellular agriculture) can also limit the pressures on finite natural resources (Parodi et al. 2018; Zabaniotou 2018) 
(AR6 WGIII Section 12.4).
Cross-sectoral Perspectives  Chapter 1212Cross-Working Group Box 3 (continued)
Circular bioeconomy
Circular economy approaches (AR6 WGIII Section 12.6) are commonly depicted by two cycles, where the biological cycle focuses on 
regeneration in the biosphere and the technical cycle focuses on reuse, refurbishment and recycling to maintain value and maximise 
material recovery (Mayer et al. 2019a). Biogenic carbon flows and resources are part of the biological carbon cycle, but carbon-based 
products can be included in, and affect, both the biological and the technical carbon cycles (Kirchherr et al. 2017; Winans et al. 2017; 
Velenturf et al. 2019). The integration of circular economy and bioeconomy principles has been discussed in relation to organic waste 
management (Teigiserova et al. 2020), societal transition and policy development (European Commission 2018; Bugge et al. 2019) 
as well as COVID-19 recovery strategies (Palahí et al. 2020). To maintain the natural resource base, circular bioeconomy emphasises 
sustainable land use and the return of biomass and nutrients to the biosphere when it leaves the technical cycle.
Scarcity is an argument for adopting circular economy principles for the management of biomass, as for non-renewable resources. 
Waste avoidance, product reuse and material recycling keep down resource use while maintaining product and material value. However, 
reuse and recycling are not always feasible, for example when biofuels are used for transport and bio-based biodegradable chemicals 
are used to reduce ecological impacts, where losses to the environment are unavoidable. A balanced approach to management of 
biomass resources could start from the perspective of value preservation within the carbon cycle, with possible routes for biomass use 
based on the carbon budget defined by the Paris Agreement, principles for sustainable land use and natural ecosystem protection.
Land-use opportunities and challenges in the bioeconomy
Analyses of synergies and trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation in the agriculture and forestry sectors show that outcomes 
depend on context, design and implementation, so actions have to be tailored to the specific conditions to minimise adverse effects 
(Kongsager 2018). This is supported in literature analysing the nexus between land, water, energy and food in the context of climate 
change, which consistently concludes that addressing these different domains together rather than in isolation would enhance 
synergies and reduce trade-offs (Obersteiner et al. 2016; D’Odorico et al. 2018; Soto Golcher and Visseren-Hamakers 2018; Froese 
et al. 2019; Momblanch et al. 2019).
Nature-based solutions addressing climate change can provide opportunities for sustainable livelihoods as well as multiple ecosystem 
services, such as flood risk management through floodplain restoration, saltmarshes, mangroves or peat renaturation (UNEP 2021; 
AR6 WGII Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL). Climate-smart agriculture can increase productivity while enhancing resilience and reducing 
GHG emissions inherent to production (Lipper et al. 2014; Bell et al. 2018; FAO 2019b; Singh and Chudasama 2021). Similarly, climate-
smart forestry considers the whole value chain and integrates climate objectives into forest sector management through multiple 
measures (from strict reserves to more intensively managed forests) providing mitigation and adaptation benefits (Nabuurs et al. 
2018; Verkerk et al. 2020) (AR6 WGIII Section 7.3).

Chapter 12 Cross-sectoral Perspectives12Cross-Working Group Box 3 (continued)
Agroecological approaches can be integrated into a wide range of land management practices to support a sustainable bioeconomy 
and address equity considerations (HLPE 2019). Relevant land-use practices, such as agroforestry, intercropping, organic amendments, 
cover crops and rotational grazing, can provide mitigation and support adaption to climate change via food security, livelihoods, 
biodiversity and health co-benefits (Ponisio et al. 2015; Garibaldi et al. 2016; D’Annolfo et al. 2017; Bezner Kerr et al. 2019; Clark 
et al. 2019b; Córdova et al. 2019; HLPE 2019; Mbow et al. 2019; Renard and Tilman 2019; Sinclair et al. 2019; Bharucha et al. 2020; 
Bezner Kerr et al. 2021) (AR6 WGII Cross-Chapter Box NATURAL). Strategic integration of appropriate biomass production systems 
into agricultural landscapes can provide biomass for bioenergy and other bio-based products while providing co-benefits such as 
enhanced landscape diversity, habitat quality, retention of nutrients and sediment, erosion control, climate regulation, flood regulation, 
pollination and biological pest and disease control (Christen and Dalgaard 2013; Asbjornsen et al. 2014; Holland et al. 2015; Ssegane 
et al. 2015; Dauber and Miyake 2016; Milner et al. 2016; Ssegane and Negri 2016; Styles et al. 2016; Zumpf et al. 2017; Cacho et al. 
2018; Alam and Dwivedi 2019; Cubins et al. 2019; HLPE 2019; Olsson et al. 2019; Zalesny et al. 2019; Englund et al. 2020) (AR6 WGIII 
Box 12.3). Such approaches can help limit environmental impacts from intensive agriculture while maintaining or increasing land 
productivity and biomass output.
Transitions from conventional to new biomass production and conversion systems include challenges related to cross-sector 
integration and limited experience with new crops and land use practices, including needs for specialised equipment (Thornton and 
Herrero 2015; HLPE 2019) (AR6 WGII Section 5.10). Introduction of agroecological approaches and integrated biomass/food crop 
production can result in lower food crop yields per hectare, particularly during transition phases, potentially causing indirect landuse 
change, but can also support higher and more stable yields, reduce costs, and increase profitability under climate change (Muller et al. 
2017; Seufert and Ramakutty 2017; Barbieri et al. 2019; HLPE 2019; Sinclair et al. 2019; Smith et al. 2019a; Smith et al. 2020). Crop 
diversification, organic amendments, and biological pest control (HLPE 2019) can reduce input costs and risks of occupational pesticide 
exposure and food and water contamination (González-Alzaga et al. 2014; EFSA 2017; Mie et al. 2017), reduce farmers’ vulnerability 
to climate change (e.g., droughts and spread of pests and diseases affecting plant and animal health) (Delcour et al. 2015; FAO 2020) 
and enhance provisioning and sustaining ecosystem services, such as pollination (D’Annolfo et al. 2017; Sinclair et al. 2019).
Barriers toward wider implementation include absence of policies that compensate land owners for providing enhanced ecosystem 
services and other environmental benefits, which can help overcome short-term losses during the transition from conventional practices 
before longer-term benefits can accrue. Other barriers include limited access to markets, knowledge gaps, financial, technological or 
labour constraints, lack of extension support and insecure land tenure (Jacobi et al. 2017; Kongsager 2017; Hernández-Morcillo et al. 
2018; Iiyama et al. 2018; HLPE 2019). Regional-level agroecology transitions may be facilitated by co-learning platforms, farmer 
networks, private sector, civil society groups, regional and local administration and other incentive structures (e.g., price premiums, 
access to credit, regulation) (Coe et al. 2014; Pérez-Marin et al. 2017; Mier y Terán Giménez Cacho et al. 2018; HLPE 2019; Valencia 
et al. 2019; SAEPEA 2020). With the right incentives, improvements can be made with regard to profitability, making alternatives more 
attractive to land owners.
Governing the solution space
Literature analysing the synergies and trade-offs between competing demands for land suggest that solutions are highly contextualised 
in terms of their environmental, socio-economic and governance-related characteristics, making it difficult to devise generic solutions 
(Haasnoot et al. 2020). Aspects of spatial and temporal scale can further enhance the complexity, for instance where transboundary 
effects across jurisdictions or upstream-downstream characteristics need to be considered, or where climate change trajectories might 
alter relevant biogeophysical dynamics (Postigo and Young 2021). Nonetheless, there is broad agreement that taking the needs and 
perspectives of multiple stakeholders into account in a transparent process during negotiations improves the chances of achieving 
outcomes that maximise synergies while limiting trade-offs (Ariti et al. 2018; Metternicht 2018; Favretto et al. 2020; Kopáček 2021; 
Muscat et al. 2021). Yet differences in agency and power between stakeholders or anticipated changes in access to or control of 
resources can undermine negotiation results even if there is a common understanding of the overarching benefits of more integrated 
environmental agreements and the need for greater coordination and cooperation to avoid longer-term losses to all (Aarts and 
Leeuwis 2010; Weitz et al. 2017). There is also the risk that strong local participatory processes can become disconnected from broader 
national plans, and thus fail to support the achievement of national targets. Thus, connection between levels is needed to ensure that 
ambition for transformative change is not derailed at local level (Aarts and Leeuwis 2010; Postigo and Young 2021).
Decisions on land uses between biomass production for food, feed, fibre or fuel, as well as nature conservation or restoration and 
other uses (e.g., mining, urban infrastructure), depend on differences in perspectives and values. Because the availability of land for 
diverse biomass uses is invariably limited, setting priorities for land-use allocations therefore first depends on making the perspectives 
underlying what is considered as ‘high-value’ explicit (Fischer et al. 2007; Garnett et al. 2015; De Boer and Van Ittersum 2018; 
Cross-sectoral Perspectives  Chapter 1212Cross-Working Group Box 3 (continued)
Muscat et al. 2020). Decisions can then be made transparently based on societal norms, needs and the available resource base. 
Prioritisation of land use for the common good therefore requires societal consensus building embedded in the socio-economic and 
cultural fabric of regions, societies and communities. Integration of local decision-making with national planning ensures local actions 
complement national development objectives.
International trade in the global economy today provides important opportunities to connect producers and consumers, effectively 
buffering price volatilities and potentially offering producer countries access to global markets, which can be seen as an effective 
adaptation measure (Baldos and Hertel 2015; Costinot et al. 2016; Hertel and Baldos 2016; Gouel and Laborde 2021) (AR6 WGII 
Section 5.11). But there is also clear evidence that international trade and the global economy can enhance price volatility, lead 
to food price spikes and affect food security due to climate and other shocks, as seen recently due to the COVID-19 pandemic 
(Cottrell et al. 2019; WFP-FSIN 2020; Verschuur et al. 2021) (AR6 WGII Section 5.12). The continued strong demand for food and 
other bio-based products, mainly from high- and middle-income countries, therefore requires better cooperation between nations 
and global governance of trade to more accurately reflect and disincentivise their environmental and social externalities. Trade in 
agricultural and extractive products driving land-use change in tropical forest and savanna biomes is of major concern because of 
the biodiversity impacts and GHG emissions incurred in their provision (Hosonuma et al. 2012; Forest Trends 2014; Smith et al. 2014; 
Henders et al. 2015; Curtis et al. 2018; Pendrill et al. 2019; Seymour and Harris 2019; Kissinger et al. 2021) (AR6 WGII Tropical Forests 
Cross-Chapter Paper).
In summary, there is significant scope for optimising use of land resources to produce more biomass while reducing adverse effects 
(high confidence). Context-specific prioritisation, technology innovation in bio-based production, integrative policies, coordinated 
institutions and improved governance mechanisms to enhance synergies and minimise trade-offs can mitigate the pressure on 
managed as well as natural and semi-natural ecosystems (medium confidence). Yet, energy conservation and efficiency measures, and 
deployment of technologies and systems that do not rely on carbon-based energy and materials, are essential for mitigating biomass 
demand growth as countries pursue ambitious climate goals (high confidence).
12.6 Other Cross-sectoral 
Implications of Mitigation
This section presents further cross-sectoral considerations related 
to GHG mitigation. Firstly, various cross-sectoral perspectives on 
mitigation actions are presented. Then, sectoral policy interactions 
are presented. Finally, implications in terms of international trade 
spillover effects and competitiveness, and finance flows and related 
spillover effects at the sectoral level, are addressed.
12.6.1 Cross-sectoral Perspectives on Mitigation Action
Chapters 5 to 11 present mitigation measures applicable in individual 
sectors, and potential co-benefits and adverse side effects4 of these 
individual measures. This section builds on the sectoral analysis 
of mitigation action from a  cross-sectoral perspective. Firstly, 
Section 12.6.1.1 brings together some of the observations presented 
in the sectoral chapters to show how different mitigation actions in 
different sectors can contribute to the same co-benefits and result 
in the same adverse side effects, thereby demonstrating the potential 
synergistic effects. The links between these co-benefits and adverse 
side effects and the SDGs is also demonstrated. In Section 12.6.1.2, 

understanding of adverse side effects highlights where policy- and decision makers are required to make trade-offs between mitigation benefits and other impacts. The 
choice of language differs to some degree in other chapters.the focus turns from sector-specific mitigation measures to mitigation 
measures which have cross-sectoral implications, including measures 
that have application in more than one sector and measures where 
implementation in one sector impacts on implementation in another. 
Finally, Section  12.6.1.3 notes the cross-sectoral relevance of 
a selection of general-purpose technologies, a topic that is covered 
further in Chapter 16.
12.6.1.1 A Cross-sectoral Perspective on Co-benefits and 
Adverse Side Effects of Mitigation Measures, and 
Links with the SDGs
A body of literature has been developed which addresses the 
co-benefits of climate mitigation action (Karlsson et al. 2020). Adverse 
side effects of mitigation are also well documented. Co-benefits 
and adverse side effects in individual sectors and associated with 
individual mitigation measures are discussed in the individual sector 
chapters (Sections 5.2, 6.7.7, 7.4, 7.6, 8.2, 8.4, 9.8, 10.1.1 and 11.5.3), 
as well as in previous IPCC General and Special Assessment reports. 
The term ‘co-impacts’ has been proposed to capture both the co-
benefits and adverse side effects of mitigation. An alternative framing 
is one of multiple objectives, where climate change mitigation is 
placed alongside other objectives when assessing policy decisions 
Chapter 12 Cross-sectoral Perspectives12(Ürge-Vorsatz et al. 2014; Mayrhofer and Gupta 2016; Cohen et al. 
2017; Bhardwaj et al. 2019).
The identification and assessment of co-benefits has been argued to 
serve a  number of functions (Section  1.4) including using them as 
leverage for securing financial support for implementation, providing 
justification of actions which provide a balance of both short- and long-
term benefits and obtaining stakeholder buy-in (robust evidence,  low 
agreement) (Karlsson et al. 2020). Assessment of adverse side effects 
has been suggested to be useful in avoiding unforeseen negative 
impacts of mitigation and providing policy- and decision-makers with 
the information required to make informed trade-offs between climate 
and other benefits of actions (Ürge-Vorsatz et al. 2014; Bhardwaj et al. 
2019; Cohen et al. 2019) (high evidence,  low agreement).
Various approaches to identifying and organising co-impacts in 
specific contexts and across sectors have been proposed towards 
providing more comparable and standardised analyses. However, 
consistent quantification of co-impacts, including cost-benefit 
analysis, and the utilisation of the resulting information, remain 
a challenge (Ürge-Vorsatz et al. 2014; Floater et al. 2016; Mayrhofer 
and Gupta 2016; Cohen et al. 2019; Karlsson et al. 2020). This 
challenge is further exacerbated when considering that co-impacts of 
a mitigation measure in one sector can either enhance or reduce the 
co-impacts associated with mitigation in another, or the achievement 
of co-benefits in one geographic location can lead to adverse side 
effects in another. For example, the production of lithium for batteries for energy storage has the potential to contribute to protecting water 
resources and reducing wastes associated with coal-fired power in 
many parts of the world, but mining of lithium has the potential 
for creating water and waste challenges if not managed properly 
(Agusdinata et al. 2018; Kaunda 2020).
While earlier literature has suggested that co-impacts assessments 
can support adoption of climate mitigation action, a  more recent 
body of literature has suggested limitations in such framing (Ryan 
2015; Bernauer and McGrath 2016; Walker et al. 2018). Presenting 
general information on co-impacts as a component of a mitigation 
analysis does not always lead to increased support for climate 
mitigation action. Rather, the most effective framing is determined 
by factors relating to local context, type of mitigation action under 
consideration and target stakeholder group. More work has been 
identified to be required to bring context into planning co-impacts 
assessments and communication thereof (Ryan 2015; Bernauer and 
McGrath 2016; Walker et al. 2018) (low evidence, low agreement).
An area where the strong link between the cross-sectoral co-impacts 
of mitigation action and global government policies is being clearly 
considered is in the achievement of the SDGs (Obergassel et al. 2017; 
Doukas et al. 2018; Markkanen and Anger-Kraavi 2019; Smith et al. 
2019; van Soest et al. 2019) (Chapters 1 and 17, individual sectoral 
chapters). Figure 12.9 demonstrates these relationships from a cross-
sectoral perspective. It shows the links between sectors which give 
rise to emissions, the mitigation measures that can find application

perspective in the context of the SDGs could help to further support 
climate mitigation action, particularly within the context of the Paris 
Agreement (Gomez-Echeverri 2018) (medium evidence, medium 
agreement). Literature sources utilised in the compilation of this 
diagram are presented in Supplementary Material 12.SM.3.
12.6.1.2 Mitigation Measures from a Cross-sectoral Perspective
Three aspects of mitigation from a  cross-sectoral perspective are 
considered, following Barker et al. (2007):
• mitigation measures used in more than one sector;
• implications of mitigation measures for interaction and 
integration between sectors; and
• competition among sectors for scarce resources.
A number of mitigation measures find application in more than 
one sector. Renewable energy technologies such as solar and wind 
may be used for grid electricity supply, as embedded generation in 
the buildings sector and for energy supply in the agriculture sector 
(Shahsavari and Akbari 2018) (Chapters 6, 7 and 8). Hydrogen and 
fuel cells, coupled with low-carbon energy technologies for producing 
the hydrogen, are being explored in transport, urban heat, industry 
and for balancing electricity supply (Dodds et al. 2015; Staffell et al. 
2019) (Chapters  6, 8  and 11). Electric vehicles are considered an 
option for balancing variable power (Kempton and Tomić 2005; Liu 
and Zhong 2019). Carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon 
capture and utilisation (CCU) have potential application in a number 
of industrial processes (cement, iron and steel, petroleum refining 
and pulp and paper) (Leeson et al. 2017; Garcia and Berghout 2019) 
(Chapters 6 and 11) and the fossil fuel electricity sector (Chapter 6). 
When coupled with energy recovery from biomass, CCS can provide 
a carbon sink (BECCS) (Section 12.5). On the demand side, energy 
efficiency options find application across the sectors (Chapters  6, 
8, 9, 10, and 11), as do reducing demand for goods and services 
(Chapter 5) and improving material efficiency (Section 11.3.2).
A range of examples where mitigation measures result in cross-
sectoral interactions and integration is identified. The mitigation 
potential of electric vehicles, including plug-in hybrids, is linked to 
the extent of decarbonisation of the electricity grid, as well as to the 
liquid fuel supply emissions profile (Lutsey 2015). Making buildings 
energy positive, where excess energy is used to charge vehicles, can 
increase the potential of electric and hybrid vehicles (Zhou et al. 
2019). Advanced process control and process optimisation in industry 
can reduce energy demand and material inputs (Section 11.3), which 
in turn can reduce emissions linked to resource extraction and 
manufacturing. Reductions in coal-fired power generation through 
replacement with renewables or nuclear power result in a reduction 
in coal mining and its associated emissions. Increased recycling 
results in a reduction in emissions from primary resource extraction. 
CCU can contribute to the transition to more renewable energy 
systems via power-to-X technologies, which enables the production 
of CO 2-based fuels/e-fuels and chemicals using carbon dioxide and hydrogen (Breyer et al. 2015; Anwar et al. 2020). Certain emissions 
reductions in the AFOLU sector are contingent on energy sector 
decarbonisation. Trees and green roofs planted to counter urban 
heat islands reduce the demand for energy for air conditioning and 
simultaneously sequester carbon (Kim and Coseo 2018; Kuronuma 
et al. 2018). Recycling of organic waste avoids methane generation if 
the waste would have been disposed of in landfill sites, can generate 
renewable energy if treated through anaerobic digestion, and can 
reduce requirements for synthetic fertiliser production if the nutrient 
value is recovered (Creutzig et al. 2015). Liquid transport biofuels link 
to the land, energy and transport sectors (Section 12.5.2.2).
Demand-side mitigation measures, discussed in Chapter 5, also have 
cross-sectoral implications which need to be taken into account when 
calculating mitigation potentials. Residential electrification has the 
potential to reduce emissions associated with lighting and heating, 
particularly in developing countries where these are currently met 
by fossil fuels and using inefficient technologies, but will increase 
demand for electricity (Chapters 5 and 8 and Sections 6.6.2.3 and 
8.4.3.1). Many industrial processes can also be electrified in the move 
away from fossil reductants and direct energy carriers (Chapter 11). 
The impact of electrification on electricity sector emissions will 
depend on whether electricity generation is based on fossil fuels in 
the absence of CCS or low-carbon energy sources (Chapter 5).
At the same time, saving electricity in all sectors reduces the demand 
for electricity, thereby reducing mitigation potential of renewables and 
CCS.  Demand-side flexibility measures and electrification of vehicle 
fleets are supportive of more intermittent renewable energy supply 
options (Sections 6.3.7, 6.4.3.1 and 10.3.4). Production of maize, wheat, 
rice and fresh produce requires lower energy inputs on a lifecycle basis 
than poultry, pork and ruminant-based meats (Clark and Tilman 2017) 
(Section 12.4). It also requires less land area per kilocalorie or protein 
output (Clark and Tilman 2017; Poore and Nemecek 2018), so replacing 
meat with these products makes land available for sequestration, 
biodiversity or other societal needs. However, production of co-products 
of the meat industry, such as leather and wool, is reduced, resulting 
in a  need for substitutes. Further discussion and examples of cross-
sectoral implications of mitigation, with respect to cost and potentials, 
are presented in Section 12.2. One final example on this topic included 
here is that of circular economy (Box 12.4).
Finally, in terms of competition among sectors for scarce resources, 
this issue is often considered in the assessments of mitigation 
potentials linked to bioenergy and diets (vegetable vs animal food 
products), land use and water (robust evidence, high agreement) 
(Section 12.5 and Cross-Working Group Box 3 in this Chapter). It is, 
however, also relevant elsewhere. Constraints have been identified 
in the supply of indium, tellurium, silver, lithium, nickel and platinum 
that are required for implementation of some specific renewable 
energy technologies (Watari et al. 2018; Moreau et al. 2019). Other 
studies have shown constraints in supply of cobalt, one of the key 
elements used in production of lithium-ion batteries, which has been 
assessed for mitigation potential in energy, transport and buildings 
sectors (medium evidence, high agreement) (Jaffe 2017; Olivetti et al. 
2017), although alternatives to cobalt are being developed (Olivetti 
et al. 2017; Watari et al. 2018).
Chapter 12 Cross-sectoral Perspectives1212.6.1.3 Cross-sectoral Considerations Relating to Emerging 
General-purpose Technologies
General-purpose technologies (GPTs) include, but are not limited 
to, additive manufacturing, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, 
hydrogen, digitalisation, electrification, nanotechnology and robots 
(de Coninck et al. 2018). Many of the individual sectoral chapters have 
identified the roles that such technologies can have in supporting 
mitigation of GHG emissions. Section 16.2.2.3 presents an overview 
of the individual technologies and specific applications thereof.
In this chapter, which focuses on cross-sectoral implications of 
mitigation, it is highlighted that certain of these GPTs will find 
application across the sectors, and there will be synergies and trade-
offs when utilising these technologies in more than sector. One 
example here is the use of hydrogen as an energy carrier, which, 
when coupled with low-carbon energy, has potential for driving 
mitigation in energy, industry, transport, and buildings. The increased 
uptake of hydrogen across the economy requires establishment of 
hydrogen production, transport and storage infrastructure which 
could simultaneously support multiple sectors, although there is the 
potential to utilise existing infrastructure in some parts of the world 
(Alanne and Cao 2017).Box 12.5 provides further details on hydrogen in the context of cross-
sectoral mitigation specifically, while further details on the role of 
hydrogen in individual sectors are provided in Chapters 6, 8. 9, 10 and 
11. In contrast, the benefits of digitalisation, which could potentially 
give rise to substantial energy savings across multiple sectors, need 
to be traded off against demand for electricity to operate consumer 
devices, data centres, and data networks. Measures are required 
to increase energy efficiency of these technologies (IEA 2017). 
Section 5.3.4.1 of this report provides further information on energy 
and emissions benefits and costs of digitalisation.
With respect to co-impacts of GPTs, the other focus of this chapter, 
it is highlighted that assessment of the environmental, social 
and economic implications of such technologies is challenging and 
context specific, with multiple potential cross-sectoral linkages 
(de  Coninck et al. 2018). Each GPT would need to be explored in 
context of what it is being used for, and potentially in the geographical 
context, in order to understand the co-impacts of its use.Box 12.4 | Circular Economy from a Cross-Sectoral Perspective
Circular economy approaches consider the entire lifecycle of goods and services, and seek to design out waste and pollution, keep 
products and materials in use, and regenerate natural systems (The Ellen MacArthur Foundation 2013; CIRAIG 2015). The use of 
circular economy for rethinking how society’s needs for goods and services is delivered in such a way as to minimise resource use 
and environmental impact and maximise societal benefit has been discussed elsewhere in this assessment report (Chapter 5 and 
Section 5.3.4). A wide range of potential application areas is identified, from food systems to bio-based products to plastics to metals 
and minerals to manufactured goods. Circular economy approaches are implicitly cross-sectoral, impacting the energy, industrial, 
AFOLU, waste and other sectors. They will have climate and non-climate co-benefits and trade-offs. The scientific literature mainly 
investigates incremental measures claiming but not demonstrating mitigation; highest mitigation potential is found in the industry, 
energy, and transport sectors; mid-range potential in the waste and building sectors; and lowest mitigation gains in agriculture 
(Cantzler et al. 2020). Circular economy thinking has been identified to support increased resilience to the physical effects of climate 
change and contribute to meeting other SDGs, notably SDG  12 (responsible consumption and production) (The Ellen MacArthur 
Foundation 2019).
Circular economy approaches to deployment of low-carbon infrastructure have been suggested to be important to optimise resource 
use and mitigate environmental and societal impacts caused by extraction and manufacturing of composite and critical materials 
as well as infrastructure decommissioning (Jensen and Skelton 2018; Sica et al. 2018; Salim et al. 2019; Watari et al. 2019; Jensen 
et al. 2020; Mignacca et al. 2020). The circular carbon economy is an approach inspired by the circular economy principles that rely 
on a  combination of technologies, including CCU, CCS and CDR, to enable transition pathways especially relevant in economies 
dependent on fossil fuel exports (Lee et al. 2017; Alshammari 2020; Morrow and Thompson 2020; Zakkour et al. 2020). The integration 
of circular economy and bioeconomy principles (Cross-Working Group Box 3 in this chapter) is conceptualised in relation to policy 
development (European Commission 2018) as well as COVID-19 recovery strategies (Palahí et al. 2020), emphasising the use of 
renewable energy sources and sustainable management of ecosystems with transformation of biological resources into food, feed, 
energy and biomaterials.
At this stage, however, there is no single global agreement on how circular economy principles are best implemented, and differential 
government support for circular economy interventions is observed in different jurisdictions.
Cross-sectoral Perspectives  Chapter 1212Box 12.5 | Hydrogen in the Context of Cross-sectoral Mitigation Options
Interest in hydrogen as an intermediary energy carrier has grown rapidly in the years since the 5th Assessment Report of WGIII (AR5) 
was published. This is reflected in this WGIII assessment report, where the term ‘hydrogen’ is used more than five times more often than 
in AR5. In Chapter 6 of this report, it is shown that hydrogen can be produced with low carbon impact from fossil fuels (Section 6.4.2.6), 
renewable electricity and nuclear energy (Section 6.4.5.1), or biomass (Section 6.4.2.5). In the energy sector, hydrogen is one of the 
options for storage of energy in low-carbon electricity systems (Sections 6.4.4.1 and 6.6.2.2). But, also importantly, hydrogen can be 
produced to be used as a fuel for sectors that are hard to decarbonise; this is possible directly in the form of hydrogen, but also in 
the form of ammonia or other energy carriers (Section 6.4.5.1). In the transport sector, fuel cell engines (Section 10.3.3) running on 
hydrogen can become important, especially for heavy duty vehicles (Section 10.4.3). In the industry sector hydrogen already plays an 
important role in the chemical sector (for ammonia and methanol production) (Box 11.1 in Chapter 11) and in the fuel sector (in oil 
refinery processes and for biofuel production) (IEA 2019b). Beyond the production of ammonia and methanol for both established 
and novel applications, the largest potential industrial application for low-carbon hydrogen is seen in steel-making (Section 11.4.1.1). 
Hydrogen and hydrogen derivatives can play a further role as substitute energy carriers (Section 11.3.5) and for the production of 
intermediate chemical products such as methanol, ethanol and ethylene when combined with CCU (Section 11.3.6). For the building 
sector, the exploration of the usefulness of hydrogen is at an early stage (Box 9.4).
An overview report (IEA 2019b) already sees opportunities in 2030 for buildings, road freight and passenger vehicles. This report also 
suggests a high potential application in iron and steel production, aviation and maritime transport, and for electricity storage. Several 
industry roadmaps have been published that map out a possible role for hydrogen until 2050. The most well known and ambitious 
is the roadmap by the Hydrogen Council (2017), which sketches a global scenario leading to 78 EJ hydrogen use in 2050, mainly for 
transport, industrial feedstock, industrial energy and to a lesser extent for buildings and power generation. Hydrogen makes up 18% of 
total final energy use in this vision. An analysis by IRENA on hydrogen from renewable sources comes to a substantially lower number: 

published for the European Union, for example by the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (Blanco et al. 2018; EC 2018; FCH 
2019; Navigant 2019). All these reports have scenario variants with hydrogen share in final energy use of 10% to over 20% by 2050.
When it comes to the production of low-carbon hydrogen, the focus of the attention is on production using electricity from renewable 
sources via electrolysis, so-called ‘green hydrogen’. However, ‘blue hydrogen’, produced out of natural gas with CCS, is also often 
considered. Since a significantly increasing role for hydrogen would require considerable infrastructure investments and would affect 
existing trade flows in raw materials, governments have started to set up national hydrogen strategies, both potential exporting 
(e.g., Australia) and importing (e.g., Japan) countries (METI 2017; COAG Energy Council 2019).
As already reported in Chapter 6 (Section 6.2.4.1), production costs of green hydrogen are expected to come down from the current 
levels of above USD100 MWh–1. Price expectations are: EUR40–60 MWh–1 for both green and blue hydrogen production in the EU 
by 2050 (Navigant 2019) with production costs already being lower in North Africa; 42–87 USD MWh–1 for green hydrogen in 2030 
and 20–41 USD MWh–1 in 2050 (BNEF 2020); EUR75 MWh–1 in 2030 (Glenk and Reichelstein 2019). For fossil-based technologies 
combined with CCS, prices may range from USD33–80 MWh–1 (Table 6.8). Such prices can make hydrogen competitive for industrial 
feedstock applications, and probably for several transportation modes in combination with fuel cells, but without further incentives, not 
necessarily for stationary applications in the coming decades: wholesale natural gas prices are expected to range from USD7–31 MWh–1 
across regions and scenarios, according to the World Energy Outlook (IEA 2020a); coal prices mostly are even lower than natural gas 
prices (all fossil fuel prices refer to unabated technology and untaxed fuels). The evaluation of macro-economic impacts is relatively 
rare. A study by Mayer et al. (2019b) indicated that a shift to hydrogen in iron and steel production would lead to regional GDP losses 
in the range of 0.4–2.7% in 2050 across EU+3, with some regions making gains under a low-cost electricity scenario.
The IAM scenarios imply a modest role played by hydrogen, with some scenarios featuring higher levels of penetration. The consumption 
of hydrogen is projected to increase by 2050 and onwards in scenarios likely limiting global warming to 2°C or below, and the median 
share of hydrogen in total final energy consumption is 2.1% in 2050 and 5.1% in 2100 (Box 12.4, Figure 1) (Numbers are based on 
the AR6 scenarios database). There is large variety in hydrogen shares, but the values of 10% and more of final energy use that occur 
in many roadmaps are only rarely reached in the scenarios. Hydrogen is predominantly used in the industry and transportation sectors. 
In the scenarios, hydrogen is produced mostly by electrolysis and by biomass energy conversion with CCS (Box 12.5, Figure 1). Natural 
gas with CCS is expected to play only a modest role; here a distinct difference between the roadmaps quoted before and the IAM 
results is observed.
Chapter 12 Cross-sectoral Perspectives1212.6.2 Sectoral Policy Interactions (Synergies 
and Trade-offs)
A taxonomy of policy types and attributes is provided by Section 13.6. 
In addition, the sectoral chapters provide an in-depth discussion of 
important mitigation policy issues such as policy overlaps, policy 
mixes, and policy interaction as well as policy design considerations 
and governance. The point of departure for the assessment in this 
chapter is a focus on cross-sectoral perspectives aiming at maximising 
policy synergies and minimising policy trade-offs.
Synergies and trade-offs resulting from mitigation policies are 
not clearly discernible from either sector-level studies or global 
and regional top-down studies. Rather, they would require 
a cross-sectoral integrated policy framework  (von Stechow et al. 
2015; Monier et al. 2018; Pardoe et al. 2018; Singh et al. 2019) or 
multiple-objective-multiple-impact policy assessment framework 
identifying key co-impacts and avoiding trade-offs (robust evidence, 
high agreement) (Ürge-Vorsatz et al. 2014).
Sectoral studies typically cover differentiated response measures 
while the IAM literature mostly uses uniform efficient market-based measures. This has important implications for understanding the 
differences in magnitude and distribution of mitigation costs and 
potentials of Section 12.2 (Karplus et al. 2013; Rausch and Karplus 
2014). There is a comprehensive literature on the efficiency of uniform 
carbon pricing compared to sector-specific mitigation approaches, 
but relatively less literature on the distributional impacts of carbon 
taxes and measures to mitigate potential adverse distributional 
impacts (Rausch and Karplus 2014; Rausch and Reilly 2015; Wang 
et al. 2016b; Åhman et al. 2017; Mu et al. 2018). For example, in terms 
of cross-sectoral distributional implications, studies  find negative 
competitiveness impacts for the energy-intensive industries (robust 
evidence, medium agreement) (Rausch and Karplus 2014; Wang et al. 
2016b; Åhman et al. 2017). 
Strong interdependencies and cross-sectoral linkages create both 
opportunities for synergies and the need to address trade-offs. This 
calls for coordinated sectoral approaches to climate change mitigation 
policies that mainstream these interactions  (Pardoe et al. 2018). 
Such an approach is also called for in the context of cross-sectoral 
interactions of adaptation and mitigation measures, examples are in 
the agriculture, biodiversity, forests, urban, and water sectors (Arent 
et al. 2014; Berry et al. 2015; Di Gregorio et al. 2017).  Integrated Box 12.5 (continued)

It is concluded that there is increasing confidence that hydrogen can play a significant role, especially in the transport sector and the 
industrial sector. However, there is much less agreement on timing and volumes, and there is also a range of perspectives on the role 
of the various production methods of hydrogen.
Cross-sectoral Perspectives  Chapter 1212planning and cross-sectoral alignment of climate change policies are 
particularly evident in developing countries’ NDCs pledged under 
the Paris Agreement, where key priority sectors such as agriculture 
and energy are closely aligned between the proposed mitigation 
and adaptation actions in the context of sustainable development 
and the SDGs. An example is the integration between climate-smart 
agriculture and low-carbon energy (robust evidence, high agreement) 
(Antwi-Agyei et al. 2018; England et al. 2018). Yet, there appear to be 
significant challenges relating to institutional capacity and resources 
to coordinate and implement such cross-sectoral policy alignment, 
particularly in developing country contexts (Antwi-Agyei et al. 2018).
Another dimension of climate change policy  interactions  in the 
literature is related to trade-offs and synergies between climate 
change mitigation and other societal objectives. For example, in 
mitigation policies related to energy, trade-offs and synergies 
between universal electricity access and climate change mitigation 
would call for complementary policies such as pro-poor tariffs, fuel 
subsidies, and broadly integrated policy packages  (Dagnachew 
et al. 2018). In agriculture and forestry, research suggests that 
integrated policy programmes enhance mitigation potentials across 
the land-use-agriculture-forestry nexus and lead to synergies and 
positive  spillovers  (Galik et al. 2019). To maximise synergies and 
deal with trade-offs in such a  cross-sectoral context, evidence-
based/informed and holistic policy analysis approaches like nexus approaches and multi-target back-casting approaches that take into 
account unanticipated outcomes and indirect consequences would 
be needed (robust evidence, high agreement) (Klausbruckner et al. 
2016; Hoff et al. 2019; van der Voorn et al. 2020) (Box 12.6). 
The consequences  of large-scale land-based mitigation  for food 
security, biodiversity (Dasgupta 2021), the state of soil, water 
resources, and so on can be significant, depending on many factors, 
such as economic development (including distributional aspects), 
international trade patterns, agronomic development, diets, land-
use governance and policy design, and not least climate change 
itself  (Winchester and Reilly 2015; Fujimori et al. 2018; Hasegawa 
et al. 2018; Van Meijl et al. 2018). Policies and regulations that address 
other aspects apart from climate change can indirectly influence the 
attractiveness of land-based mitigation options. For example, farmers 
may find it attractive to shift from annual food/feed crops to perennial 
grasses and short rotation woody crops (suitable for bioenergy) if 
the previous land uses become increasingly restricted due to impacts 
on groundwater quality and eutrophication of water bodies (robust 
evidence, medium agreement) (Sections 12.4 and 12.5). 
Finally, there are knowledge gaps in the literature particularly in 
relation to policy scalability and the extent and magnitude of policy 
interactions when scaling the policy to a  level consistent with 
low GHG emissions pathways such as 2°C and 1.5°C. 
Box 12.6 | Case Study: Sahara Forest Project in Aqaba, Jordan
Nexus framing
Shifting to renewable (in particular solar) energy reduces dependency on fossil fuel imports and greenhouse gas emissions, which is 
crucial for mitigating climate change. Employing renewable energy for desalination of seawater and for cooling of greenhouses in 
integrated production systems can enhance water availability, increase crop productivity and generate co-products and co-benefits 
(e.g., algae, fish, dryland restoration, greening of the desert).
Nexus opportunities
The Sahara Forest project integrated production system uses amply available natural resources, namely solar energy and seawater, 
for improving water availability and agricultural/biomass production, while simultaneously providing new employment opportunities. 
Using hydroponic systems and humidity in the air, water needs for food production are 50% lower compared to other greenhouses.
Technical and economic nexus solutions
Several major technologies are combined in the Sahara Forest Project, namely electricity production through the use of solar power 
(PV or CSP), freshwater production through seawater desalination using renewable energy, seawater-cooled greenhouses for food 
production, and outdoor revegetation using run-off from the greenhouses.
Stakeholders involved
The key stakeholders which benefit from such an integrated production system are from the water sector, which urgently requires an 
augmentation of irrigation (and other) water, and the agricultural sector, which relies on the additional desalinated water to maintain 
and increase agricultural production. The project also involves public and private sector partners from Jordan and abroad, with little 
engagement of civil society so far.
Chapter 12 Cross-sectoral Perspectives1212.6.3 International Trade Spillover Effects 
and Competitiveness
International spillovers of mitigation policies are effects that 
carbon-abatement measures implemented in one country have on 
sectors in other countries. These effects include (i) carbon leakage 
in manufacture; (ii) the effects on energy trade flows and incomes 
related to fossil fuel exports from major exporters; (iii) technology 
and knowledge spillovers; and (iv) transfer of norms and preferences 
via various approaches to establish sustainability requirements on 
traded goods, such as EU-RED and environmental labelling systems 
to guide consumer choices (robust evidence, medium agreement). 
This section focuses on cross-sectoral aspects of international 
spillovers related to the first two effects.
12.6.3.1 Cross-sectoral Aspects of Carbon Leakage
Carbon leakage occurs when mitigation measures implemented in 
one country or sector lead to a  rise in emissions in other countries 
or sectors. Three types of spillovers are possible: (i) domestic cross-
sectoral spillovers when mitigation policy in one sector leads to the 
re-allocation of labour and capital towards the other sectors of the 
same country; (ii) international spillovers within a single sector when 
mitigation policy leads to substitution of domestic production of carbon-
intensive goods with their imports from abroad; and (iii) international 
cross-sectoral spillovers when mitigation policy in one sector in one 
country leads to the rise in emissions in other sectors in other countries. 
While the first two are described in Section 13.6, this section focuses 
on the third. Though some papers address this type of leakage, there is 
still a significant lack of knowledge on this topic.
One possible channel of cross-sectoral international carbon leakage 
is through global value chains. Mitigation policy in one country not 
only leads to shifts in competitiveness across industries producing final goods but also across those producing raw materials and 
intermediary goods all over the world.
This type of leakage is especially important because the countries 
that provide basic materials are usually emerging or developing 
economies, many of which have no or limited regulation of GHG 
emissions. For this reason, foreign direct investment in developing 
economies usually leads to an increase in emissions (Kivyiro and 
Arminen 2014; Shahbaz et al. 2015; Bakhsh et al. 2017): in the case 
of basic materials the effect of expansion of economic activity on 
emissions exceeds the effect of technological spillovers, while for 
developed countries the effect is opposite (Shahbaz et al. 2015; 
Pazienza 2019). Meng et al. (2018) calculated that environmental 
cost for generating one unit of GDP through international trade was 
1.4 times higher than that through domestic production in 1995. By 
2009, this difference increased to 1.8 times. Carbon leakage due 
to the differences in environmental regulation was the main driver 
of this increase.
In order to address emissions leakage through global value chains, 
Liu and Fan (2017) propose the value-added-based emissions 
accounting principle, which makes it possible to account for GHG 
emissions within the context of the economic benefit principle. 
Davis et al. (2011) notice that the analysis of value chains gives 
an opportunity to find the point where regulation would be the 
most efficient and the least vulnerable to leakage. For instance, 
transaction costs of global climate policy and the risks of leakage 
may be reduced if emissions are regulated at the extraction stage as 
there are far fewer agents involved in this process than in burning of 
fossil fuels or consumption of energy-intensive goods. Li et al. (2020) 
calls for coordinated efforts to reduce emissions embodied in trade 
flows in pairs of the economies with the highest leakage, such as 
China and the United States, China and Germany, China and Japan, 
Russia and Germany.Box 12.6 (continued)
Framework conditions
The Sahara Forest Project has been implemented at pilot scale so far, including the first pilot with one hectare and one greenhouse 
pilot in Qatar and a larger ‘launch station’ with three hectares and two greenhouses in Jordan. These pilots have been funded by 
international organisations such as the Norwegian Ministry of Climate and Environment, Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the 
European Union. Alignment with national policies, institutions and funding, as well as upscaling of the project, is underway or planned.
Monitoring and evaluation and next steps
The multi-sectoral planning and investments that are needed to upscale the project require cooperation among the water, agriculture, 
and energy sectors and an active involvement of local actors, private companies, and investors. These cooperation and involvement 
mechanisms are currently being established in Jordan. Given the emphasis on the economic value of the project, public-private 
partnerships are considered as the appropriate business and governance model, when the project is upscaled. Scenarios for upscaling 
(seawater use primarily in low-lying areas close to the sea, to avoid energy-intensive pumping) include 50 MW of CSP , 50 hectares of 
greenhouses, which would produce 34,000 tonnes of vegetables annually, provide employment for over 800 people, and sequester 
more than 8000 tonnes of CO 2-eq annually.

Cross-sectoral Perspectives  Chapter 1212Unfortunately, these proposals either face difficulties in collection 
and verification of data on emissions along value chains or require 
a high level of international cooperation, which is hardly achievable 
at the moment. Neuhoff et al. (2016) and Pollitt et al. (2020) focus 
on the regulation of emissions embodied in global value chains 
through national policy instruments. They propose implementation 
of a  charge on consumption of imported basic materials into the 
European emissions trading system. Such a  charge, equivalent to 
around EUR80 tCO 2–1, could reduce the EU’s total CO 2 emissions by 
up to 10% by 2050 (Pollitt et al. 2020) without significant effects 
on competitiveness. This proposal is very close to the carbon border 
adjustment introduced in the EU and described in more detail in 
Sections 13.2 and 13.6.
Cross-sectoral effects of carbon leakage also occur through the 
multiplier effect, when the mitigation policy in any sector in country 
A leads to the increase of relative competitiveness and therefore 
production of the same sector in country B, which automatically 
leads to the expansion of economic activity in other sectors of 
country B. This expansion may in turn lead to the rise of production 
and emissions in country A as a result of feedback effects. These 
spillovers should be taken into consideration while designing 
climate policy, along with potential synergies that may appear due 
to joint efforts. However, the scale of these effects with regards 
to leakage should not be overestimated. Even for intrasectoral 
leakage, many ex ante modelling studies generally suggest limited 
carbon leakage rates (Chapter 13). Intersectoral leakage should be 
even less significant. Interregional spillover and feedback effects 
are well studied in China (Zhang 2017; Ning et al. 2019). Even 
within a  single country, interregional spillover effects are much 
lower than intraregional effects, and feedback effects are even less 
intense. Cross-sectoral spillovers across national borders as a result 
of mitigation policy should be even smaller, although these are less 
well studied. In future, if the differences in carbon price between 
regions increase, leakage through cross-sectoral multipliers may 
play a more important role.
Another important cross-sectoral aspect of carbon leakage concerns 
the transport sector. If mitigation policy leads to the substitution of 
domestic carbon-intensive production with imports, one of the side 
effects of this substitution is the rise of emissions from transportation 
of imported goods. International transport is responsible for about 
a  third of worldwide trade-related emissions, and over 75%  of 
emissions for major manufacturing categories (Cristea et al. 
2013). Carbon leakage would potentially increase the emissions 
from transportation significantly as the trade of major consuming 
economies of the EU and US would shift towards distant trading 
partners in East and South Asia. Meng et al. (2018) consider more 
distant transportation as one of the major contributors to the rise in 
emissions embodied in international trade from 1995 to 2009.
Emissions leakage due to international trade, investment and value 
chains is a  significant obstacle to more ambitious climate policies 
in many regions. However, it does not mean that disruption of 
trade would reduce global emissions. Zhang et al. (2020) show that 
deglobalisation and the drop in international trade may result in 
emissions reductions in the short term, but in the longer term it will make each country build more complete industrial systems to satisfy 
their final demand, although they have comparative disadvantages 
in some production stages. As a  result, emissions would increase. 
According to Zhang et al. (2020), for China, the decrease of the 
degree of global value chain participation (which ranges from 0 to 1) 
by 0.1 would lead to an increase in gross carbon intensity of China’s 
exports of 11.7%. On distributional implications, Parrado and De Cian 
(2014) report that trade-driven spillover effects transmitted through 
imports of materials and equipment result in significant inter-sectoral 
distributional effects, with some sectors witnessing substantial 
expansion in activity and emissions and others witnessing a decline 
in activities and emissions.
It should also be mentioned that international trade leads to important 
knowledge and technology spillovers (Sections 16.3 and 16.5) and 
is critically important for achieving other Sustainable Development 
Goals (Section  12.6.1). Any policies imposing additional barriers 
to international trade should therefore be implemented with great 
caution and require comprehensive evaluation of various economic, 
social and environmental effects.
12.6.3.2 The Spillover Effects on the Energy Sector
Cross-sectoral trade-related spillovers of mitigation policies include 
their effect on energy prices. Other things being equal, regulation 
of emissions of industrial producers decreases the demand for fossil 
fuels that would reduce prices and encourage the rise of fossil fuel 
consumption in regions with no or weaker climate policies (robust 
evidence, medium agreement).
Arroyo-Currás et al. (2015) studied the energy channel of carbon 
leakage with the REMIND IAM of the global economy. They came to 
the conclusion that the leakage rate through the energy channel is 
less than 16% of the emissions reductions of regions who introduce 
climate policies first. This result did not differ much for different sizes 
and compositions of the early mover coalition.
Bauer et al. (2015) built a  multi-model scenario ensemble for the 
analysis of energy-related spillovers of mitigation policies and 
revealed huge uncertainty: energy-related carbon leakage rates 
varied from negative values to 50%, primarily depending on the 
trends in inter-fuel substitution.
Another kind of spillover in the energy sector concerns the ‘green 
paradox’: announcement of future climate policies causes an 
increase in production and trade in fossil fuels in the short term 
(Jensen et al. 2015; Kotlikoff et al. 2016). The delayed carbon tax 
should therefore be higher than an immediately implemented carbon 
tax in order to achieve the same temperature target (van der Ploeg 
2016). Studies also make a distinction between a ‘weak’ and ‘strong’ 
green paradox (Gerlagh 2011). The former refers to a short-term rise 
in emissions in response to climate policy, while the latter refers to 
rising cumulative damage.
The green paradox may work in different ways for different kinds 
of fossil fuels. For instance, Coulomb and Henriet (2018) show that 
climate policies in the transport and power-generation sectors 
Chapter 12 Cross-sectoral Perspectives12increase the discounted profits of the owners of conventional oil and 
gas, compared to the no-regulation baseline, but will decrease these 
profits for coal and unconventional oil and gas producers.
Many studies also distinguish different policy measures by the scale 
of green paradox they provide. The immediate carbon tax is the first-
best instrument from the perspective of global welfare. Delayed 
carbon tax leads to some green paradox but less than in the case of 
support for renewables (Michielsen 2014; van der Ploeg and Rezai 
2019). With respect to the latter, support for renewable electricity 
has a  lower green paradox than support for biofuels (Michielsen 
2014; Gronwald et al. 2017). The existence of the green paradox is 
an additional argument in favour of more decisive climate policy 
now: any postponements will lead to additional consumption of 
fossil fuels and consequently the need for more ambitious and costly 
efforts in future.
The effect of fossil fuel production expansion as a result of anticipated 
climate policy may be compensated by the effect of  divestment. 
Delayed climate policy creates incentives for investors to divest 
from fossil fuels. Bauer et al. (2018) show that this divestment effect 
is stronger and thus announcing of climate policies leads to the 
reduction of energy-related emissions.
The implication of the effects of mitigation policies through the 
energy-related spillovers channel is of particular significance to 
oil-exporting countries (medium evidence, medium agreement). 
Emissions-reduction measures lead to decreasing demand for fossil 
fuels and consequently to the decrease in exports from major oil- 
and gas-exporting countries. The case of Russia is one of the most 
illustrative. Makarov et al. (2020) show that the fulfilment by Paris 
Agreement Parties of their NDCs would lead to 25% reduction of 
Russia’s energy exports by 2030 with significant reduction of its 
economic growth rates. At the same time, the domestic consumption 
of fossil fuels is anticipated to increase in response to the drop in 
external demand that would provoke carbon leakage (Orlov and 
Aaheim 2017). Such spillovers demonstrate the need for dialogue 
between exporters and importers of fossil fuels while implementing 
the mitigation policies.
12.6.4 Implications of Finance for Cross-sectoral 
Mitigation Synergies and Trade-offs
Finance is a  principal enabler of GHG mitigation and an essential 
component of countries’ NDC packages submitted under the 
Paris Agreement (UNFCCC 2016). The assessment of investment 
requirements for mitigation along with their financing at sectoral 
levels are addressed in detail by sectoral chapters while the 
assessment of financial sources, instruments, and the overall 
mitigation financing gap is addressed by Chapter 15 (Sections 15.3, 
15.4, and 15.5). The focus in this chapter with respect to finance is on 
the scope and potential for financing integrated solutions that create 
synergies between and among sectors. 
Cross-sectoral considerations in mitigation finance are critical for the 
effectiveness of mitigation action as well as for balancing the often conflicting social, developmental and environmental policy goals at 
the sectoral level. True measures of mitigation policy impacts  and 
hence plans for resource mobilisation that properly address costs 
and benefits  cannot be developed  in isolation from their  cross-
sectoral  implications.  Unaddressed cross-sectoral coordination and 
interdependency issues are identified as major constraints in raising 
the necessary financial resources for mitigation in a  number of 
countries (Bazilian et al. 2011; Welsch et al. 2014; Hoff et al. 2019a).
Integrated financial solutions to leverage synergies between sectors, 
as opposed to purely sector-based financing, at international, 
national,  and local levels are needed to scale  up  GHG mitigation 
potentials.  At the international level,  finance from multilateral 
development banks (MDBs) is a  major source of  GHG  mitigation 
finance in developing countries (medium evidence, medium 
agreement) (World Bank Group 2015; Ha et al. 2016; Bhattacharya 
et al. 2016; Bhattacharya et al. 2018).  In 2018, MDBs reported a total 
of USD30.165 billion in financial commitments to climate change 
mitigation, with 71%  of total mitigation finance being committed 
through investment loans and the rest in the form of equity, guarantees, 
and other instruments.  GHG  reduction activities eligible for MDB 
finance are limited to those compatible with low-emission pathways 
recognising the importance of long-term structural changes, such as 
the shift in energy production to low-carbon energy technologies 
and the modal shift to low-carbon modes of transport leveraging 
both greenfield and energy efficiency projects. Sector-wise, the 
MDBs’ mitigation finance for 2018 is allocated to renewable energy 
(29%), transport (18%), energy efficiency (18%), lower-carbon and 
efficient energy generation (7%), agriculture, forestry and land use 
(8%), waste and wastewater (8%), and other sectors (12%) (MDB 
2019). Unfortunately, due to institutional and incentives issues, MDB 
finance has mostly focused on sectoral solutions and has not been able 
to properly leverage cross-sectoral synergies. At the national level, 
applied research has shown that integrated modelling of land, energy 
and water resources not only has the potential to identify superior 
solutions, but also reveals important differences in terms of investment 
requirements and  required financing arrangements  compared 
to  the  traditional sectoral  financing  toolkits  (Welsch et al. 
2014). Agriculture, forestry, nature-based solutions and other forms 
of land use are promising sectors for leveraging financing solutions 
to scale up  GHG  mitigation efforts (Section  15.4).  Moving to 
more productive and resilient forms of land use is a  complex 
task, given the cross-cutting nature of land use, which necessarily 
results in apparent trade-offs between mitigation, adaptation, and 
development objectives. Finance is one area to manage these trade-
offs where there may be opportunities to redirect the hundreds 
of billions spent annually on land use around the world towards 
green activities, without sacrificing either productivity or economic 
development  (Falconer et al. 2015).  Nonetheless,  that  would 
require active public support in  design of land-use mitigation and 
adaptation strategies, coordination between public and private 
instruments across land use sectors, and leveraging of  policy  and 
financial instruments to redirect finance toward greener land-use 
practices  (limited evidence, medium agreement).  For example,  the 
Welsch et al. (2014) study on Mauritius shows that the promotion 
of a  local biofuel industry from sugar cane could be economically 
favourable in the absence of water constraints, leading to a reduction 
Cross-sectoral Perspectives  Chapter 1212in petroleum  imports  and GHG emissions while enhancing energy 
security. Yet,  under a  water-constrained scenario as a  result of 
climate change, the need for additional energy to expand irrigation 
to previously rain-fed sugar plantations and to power desalination 
plants yields the opposite result in terms of GHG emissions and 
energy costs, making biofuels a sub-optimal option, and negatively 
affects their economics and the prospects for financing. 
At the local level, integrated planning and financing are needed to 
achieve more sustainable outcomes.  For example, at a  city level, 
integration is needed across sectors such as transport, energy systems, 
buildings, sewage and solid waste to optimise emissions footprints. 
How a  city is designed will  affect transportation demands, which 
makes it either more or less difficult to implement efficient public 
transportation, leading in turn to more or fewer emissions.  Under 
such cases, solutions in terms of public and private investment paths 
and financing policies based on purely internal sector considerations 
are bound to cause adverse impacts on other sectors and poor overall 
outcomes (Gouldson et al. 2016).
Availability and access to finance are among the major barriers to 
GHG emissions mitigation across various sectors and technology 
options  (robust evidence, high agreement).  Resource maturity 
mismatches and risk exposure are two main factors limiting ability 
of commercial banks and other private lenders to contribute to 
green finance  (Mazzucato and Semieniuk 2018).  At all levels, 
mobilising the necessary resources  to leverage cross-sectoral 
mitigation synergies  would  require the combination of public and 
private financial sources (Jensen and Dowlatabadi 2018). Traditional 
public financing would be  required to synergise mitigation across 
sectors  where the risk-return and time profiles of investment are 
not sufficiently attractive for the business sector.  Over the years, 
private development financing through public-private partnerships 
and other related variants has been  a growing source of finance 
to leverage cross-sectoral  synergies and manage trade-offs 
(Anbumozhi and Timilsina 2018; Attridge and Engen 2019; Ishiwatari 
et al. 2019). Promoting such blended approaches to finance along 
with result-based financing architectures to strengthen delivery 
institutions are advocated as effective means to mainstream cross-
sectoral mitigation finance (limited evidence, high agreement) 
(Attridge and Engen 2019; Ishiwatari et al. 2019). The World Bank 
group and the International Financial Corporation have  used 
the blended  finance results-based approach  to climate financing 
that addresses institutional, infrastructure, and service needs 
across sectors targeting  developing  countries and marginalised 
communities (GPRBA 2019; IDA 2019).12.7 Knowledge Gaps
Finally, the literature review and analysis in Chapter 12 has taken 
account of the post-AR5 literature available and accessible to the 
chapter authors. Nonetheless, the assessment of the chapter is 
incomplete without mentioning knowledge gaps encountered during 
the assessment. These knowledge gaps include:
1. Interactions (synergies and trade-offs) between different CDR 
methods when deployed together are under-researched:
 –co-benefits and trade-offs with biodiversity and ecosystem 
services associated with the implementation of CDR methods.
 –constraining technical costs and potentials for CDR methods 
to define realistically achievable costs and potentials. 
Such research is useful for improving the representation 
of CDR methods in IAMs and country-level mitigation 
pathway modelling.
2. More work is required on how framing and communication 
of mitigation actions in terms of mitigation versus co-benefits 
potential affects public support in different contexts.
3. Additional research work is required to determine the 
cross-sectoral mitigation potential of emerging general-
purpose technologies.
4. There is a  lack of literature on mitigation finance frameworks 
promoting cross-sectoral mitigation linkages.
5. Additional research is needed to better quantify the net GHG 
emissions and co-benefits and adverse effects of emerging 
food technologies.
 –Research in social and behavioural sciences should invest 
in assessing effectiveness of instruments aiming at shifting 
food choices in different national contexts.
 –A better evidence basis is required to understand synergistic 
effects of policies in food system policy packages.
6. There is a  lack of literature on regional and global mitigation 
potential of biomass production systems that are strategically 
deployed in agriculture and forestry landscapes, to achieve 
specific co-benefits.
7. There is a lack of knowledge on land occupation and associated 
co-benefits and adverse side effects from large-scale deployment 
of non-AFOLU mitigation options, and how such options can be 
integrated with agriculture and forestry to maximise synergies 
and minimise trade-offs.
Chapter 12 Cross-sectoral Perspectives12Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
FAQ 12.1 |   How could new technologies to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere 
contribute to climate change mitigation?
Limiting the increase in warming to well below 2°C, and achieving net zero CO 2 or GHG emissions, will require anthropogenic CO 2 
removal from  the atmosphere.
The carbon dioxide removal (CDR) methods studied so far have different removal potentials, costs, co-benefits and side effects. 
Some biological methods for achieving CDR, like afforestation/reforestation or wetland restoration, have long been practised. 
If implemented well, these practices can provide a  range of co-benefits, but they can also have adverse side effects such as 
biodiversity loss or food price increases. Other chemical and geochemical approaches to CDR include direct air carbon capture 
and storage (DACCS), enhanced weathering or ocean alkalinity enhancement. They are generally less vulnerable to reversal than 
biological methods.
DACCS uses chemicals that bind to CO 2 directly from the air; the CO 2 is then removed from the sorbent and stored underground or 
mineralised. Enhanced weathering involves the mining of rocks containing minerals that naturally absorb CO 2 from the atmosphere 
over geological timescales, which are crushed to increase the surface area and spread on soils (or elsewhere) where they absorb 
atmospheric CO 2. Ocean alkalinity enhancement involves the extraction, processing, and dissolution of minerals and addition to the 
ocean where they enhance sequestration of CO 2 as bicarbonate and carbonate ions in the ocean.
FAQ 12.2 |   Why is it important to assess mitigation measures from a systemic perspective, rather 
than only looking at their potential to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions?
Mitigation measures do not only reduce GHGs, but have wider impacts. They can result in decreases or increases in GHG emissions 
in another sector or part of the value chain from where they are applied. They can have wider environmental (e.g., air and water 
pollution, biodiversity), social (e.g., employment creation, health) and economic (e.g., growth, investment) co-benefits or adverse 
side effects. Mitigation and adaptation can also be linked. Taking these considerations into account can help to enhance the benefits 
of mitigation action, and avoid unintended consequences, as well as provide a stronger case for achieving political and societal 
support and raising the finances required for implementation.
FAQ 12.3 |   Why do we need a food systems approach for assessing GHG emissions and mitigation 
opportunities from food systems?
Activities associated with the food system caused about one-third of total anthropogenic GHG emissions in 2015, distributed across 
all sectors. Agriculture and fisheries produce crops and animal-source food, which are partly processed in the food industry, packed, 
distributed, retailed, cooked, and finally eaten. Each step is associated with resource use, waste generation, and GHG emissions.
A food systems approach helps identify critical areas as well as novel and alternative approaches to mitigation on both the supply 
side and the demand side of the food system. But complex co-impacts need to be considered and mitigation measures tailored to 
the specific context. International cooperation and governance of global food trade can support both mitigation and adaptation.
There is large scope for emissions reduction in both cropland and grazing production, and also in food processing, storage and 
distribution. Emerging options such as plant-based alternatives to animal food products and food from cellular agriculture are 
receiving increasing attention, but their mitigation potential is still uncertain and depends on the GHG intensity of associated energy 
systems due to relatively high energy needs. Diet changes can reduce GHG emissions and also improve health in groups with excess 
consumption of calories and animal food products, which is mainly prevalent in developed countries. Reductions in food loss and 
waste can help reduce GHG emissions further.
Recommendations to buy local food and avoid packaging can contribute to reducing GHG emissions but should not be generalised, 
as trade-offs exist with food waste, GHG footprint at farm gate, and accessibility to diverse healthy diets.
