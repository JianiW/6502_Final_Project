# 6502 Final Project
## **Introduction**
The advent of electrifying transportation sector and carbon mitigation task attracts billions dollar from the both private and public sectors including Biden's bipartisan infrastructure bills and automotive original equipment maufacturers' (OEM) investments in gigafactory. However, given intensifying geopolitics of critical minerals, China's nearly (if not absolute) dominances in electric vehicle (EV) battery, and constant technological innovation, the paper is interested to analyze media converage on lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery by running a sentiment analysis from New York Times and the Wall Street Journal's reports related to LFP battery.<br>


### **_Hypothesis_**<br>
**Thesis**: What is the sentiment towards China's lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery development in media coverage from New York Times (NYT) and Wall Street Journal (WSJ)? 

The paper hypothesizes a prodonminately strong negative tone and emotional content of the coverage on this given topic for the following reasons:<br>
1. Sino-US tensions are intensifying due to geopolitics, the ongoing contests over technological innovation and supply chains for critical minerals, and irreconcilable political ideological differences. The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal are both U.S.-based media with records of demonstrating anti-China sentiment in previous reports. As U.S media and given the rise of anti-China sentiment in the U.S, it's logical to assume a negative tone on China's development over such a critical matter.<br>
2. LFP battery provides a solution to possibly significantly cut down the current battery production cost which will bring down the EV prices and increase affordability for the public. However, the U.S. currently still relies on China's battery manufacturing despite the government's efforts to reduce China's dominance on EV batteries in past years. As medias with U.S. interests, NYT and WSJ likely publish articles and opinion pieces to demand actions from the government to regain the leading position on EV development.<br>


### **_Why it's important_**<br>
#### **Economic Impact**<br>
- Media has tremedous influence on the market and public's perceptions<br>
- negative sentiment from the media -> 
<br>

#### **Political Impact**<br>
- public view/constinuents/voters
<br>

#### **Social Impact**<br>
- climate change -> politicize?
<br>


## **Methods**
(describe how to collected and analyzed the data)
### **Method for data collection**
The primary method to collect data is web scraping including 
- HTTP Requests: accessing the HTML codes by using Request in Python. Useful information will be extracted from the responses
- Parsing HTML: parse HTML code of a website to exract the desired information. 

### **Method for text analysis**
Possible methods for text analysis is tokenization, stemming and lemmatization, and named entity recognitions.
