Executive Summary
Global net anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
during the last decade (2010–2019) were higher than at any 
previous time in human history (high confidence).  Since 2010, 
GHG emissions have continued to grow, reaching 59 ± 6.6 GtCO 2-eq 
in 2019,1 but the average annual growth in the last decade 
(1.3%, 2010–2019) was lower than in the previous decade (2.1%, 
2000–2009) (high confidence). Average annual GHG emissions were 

9.1 GtCO 2-eq yr –1 from the previous decade (2000–2009)  – the 
highest decadal average on record (high confidence). {2.2.2,  Table 2.1, 
Figure 2.2, Figure 2.5}
Emissions growth has varied, but persisted across all groups of 
GHGs (high confidence).  The average annual emission levels of the 
last decade (2010–2019) were higher than in any previous decade for 
each group of GHGs (high confidence). In 2019, CO 2 emissions were 

fluorinated gases (F-gases: HFCs, PFCs, SF 6, NF 3) 1.4 ± 0.41 GtCO 2-eq. 
Compared to 1990, the magnitude and speed of these increases 
differed across gases: CO 2 from fossil fuel and industry (FFI) grew by 

by 0.97 GtCO 2-eq yr –1 (254%), and N 2O by 0.65  GtCO 2-eq  yr –1 
(33%). CO 2 emissions from net land use, land-use change and 
forestry (LULUCF) have shown little long-term change, with large 
uncertainties preventing the detection of statistically significant 
trends. F-gases excluded from GHG emissions inventories such as 
chlorofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons are about the 
same size as those included (high confidence). {2.2.1, 2.2.2, Table 2.1, 
Figures 2.2, 2.3 and 2.5}
Globally, gross domestic product (GDP) per  capita and 
population growth remained the strongest drivers of CO 2 
emissions from fossil fuel combustion in the last decade 
(robust evidence, high agreement). Trends since 1990 continued 
in the years 2010 to 2019 with GDP per capita and population growth 
increasing emissions by 2.3% and 1.2% yr –1, respectively. This 
growth outpaced the reduction in the use of energy per unit of GDP 
(–2% yr –1, globally) as well as improvements in the carbon intensity 
of energy (–0.3% yr –1) (high confidence). {2.4.1, Figure 2.16}
The global COVID-19 pandemic led to a  steep drop in CO 2 
emissions from fossil fuel and industry (high confidence). 
Global CO 2-FFI emissions dropped in 2020 by about 5.8% (5.1–6.3%) 
or about 2.2 (1.9–2.4) GtCO 2 compared to 2019. Emissions, however, 
have rebounded globally by the end of December 2020 (medium 
confidence). {2.2.2, Figure 2.6}

commonly used in wide parts of the literature on climate change mitigation and is required for reporting emissions under the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change (UNFCCC). All metrics have limitations and uncertainties. (Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 2 and Annex II, Part II, Section 8).

are about the same size as the remaining carbon budget for 
keeping warming to 1.5°C (medium confidence).  Cumulative 
net CO 2 emissions since 1850 are increasing at an accelerating rate: 
about 62% of total cumulative CO 2 emissions from 1850 to 2019 
occurred since 1970 (1500 ± 140 GtCO 2); about 43% since 1990 
(1000 ± 90 GtCO 2); and about 17% since 2010 (410 ± 30 GtCO 2). For 
comparison, the remaining carbon budget for keeping warming to 
1.5°C with a 67% (50%) probability is about 400 (500) ± 220 GtCO 2 
(medium confidence). {2.2.2, Figure  2.7; AR6 WGI 5.5; AR6 WGI 
Table 5.8}
A growing number of countries have achieved GHG emission 
reductions longer than 10 years – a few at rates that are broadly 
consistent with climate change mitigation scenarios that limit 
warming to well below 2°C (high confidence). There are at least 


years, in line with rates observed in pathways that limit warming to 
2°C (>67%). However, the total reduction in annual GHG emissions of 
these countries is small (about 3.2 GtCO 2-eq yr –1) compared to global 
emissions growth observed over the last decades. Complementary 
evidence suggests that countries have decoupled  territorial 
CO2  emissions from GDP , but fewer have decoupled consumption-
based emissions from GDP . This decoupling has mostly occurred in 
countries with high per capita GDP and high per capita CO 2 emissions. 
{2.2.3, 2.3.3, Figure 2.11, Table 2.3, Table 2.4}
Consumption-based CO 2 emissions in Developed Countries 
and the Asia and Pacific region are higher than in other 
regions (high confidence). In Developed Countries, consumption-
based CO 2 emissions peaked at 15 GtCO 2 in 2007, declining to about 

global population, has become a major contributor to consumption-
based CO 2 emission growth since 2000 (5.5% yr –1 for 2000–2018); 
it exceeded the Developed Countries region, which accounts for 16% 
of current global population, as the largest emitter of consumption-
based CO 2. {2.3.2, Figure 2.14}
Carbon intensity improvements in the production of traded 
products have led to a net reduction in CO 2 emissions embodied 
in international trade (robust evidence, high agreement).  
A  decrease in the carbon intensity of traded products has offset 
increased trade volumes between 2006 and 2016. Emissions embodied 
in internationally traded products depend on the composition of the 
global supply chain across sectors and countries and the respective 
carbon intensity of production processes (emissions per  unit of 
economic output). {2.3, 2.4}
Developed Countries tend to be net CO 2 emission importers, 
whereas developing countries tend to be net emission exporters 
(robust evidence, high agreement).  Net CO 2 emission  transfers 
from developing to Developed Countries via global supply chains 
have decreased between 2006 and 2016. Between 2004 and 2011, 
CO2 emission embodied in trade between developing countries have 
more than doubled (from 0.47 to 1.1 Gt) with the centre of trade 
activities shifting from Europe to Asia. {2.3.4, Figure 2.15}
Emissions from developing countries have continued to grow, 
starting from a  low base of per  capita emissions and with 
a lower contribution to cumulative emissions than Developed 
Countries (robust evidence, high agreement). Average 2019 
per  capita CO 2-FFI emissions in three developing regions  – Africa 
(1.2  tCO 2 per  capita), Asia and Pacific (4.4 tCO 2 per  capita), and 
Latin America and Caribbean (2.7 tCO 2 per capita) – remained less 
than half that of Developed Countries (9.5 tCO 2 per capita) in 2019. 
CO2-FFI emissions in the three developing regions together grew by 
26% between 2010 and 2019, compared to 260% between 1990 
and 2010, while in Developed Countries emissions contracted by 
9.9% between 2010 and 2019, and by 9.6% between 1990 and 
2010. Historically, the three developing regions together contributed 
28% to cumulative CO 2-FFI emissions between 1850 and 2019, 
whereas Developed Countries contributed 57% and Least-Developed 
Countries contributed 0.4%. {2.2.3, Figures 2.9 and 2.10}
Globally, GHG emissions continued to rise across all sectors 
and subsectors; most rapidly in transport and industry (high 
confidence). In 2019, 34% (20 GtCO 2-eq) of global GHG emissions 
came from the energy sector, 24% (14 GtCO 2-eq) from industry, 22% 
(13 GtCO 2-eq) from agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU), 
15% (8.7 GtCO 2-eq) from transport and 5.6% (3.3 GtCO 2-eq) from 
buildings. Once indirect emissions from energy use are considered, 
the relative shares of industry and buildings emissions rise to 34% 
and 16%, respectively. Average annual GHG emissions growth during 

supply (from 2.3% to 1.0%) and industry (from 3.4% to 1.4%, direct 
emissions only), but remained roughly constant at about 2% per year 
in the transport sector (high confidence). Emission growth in AFOLU 
is more uncertain due to the high share of CO 2-LULUCF emissions 
(medium confidence). {2.4.2, Figure 2.13, Figures 2.16 to 2.21}
Average annual growth in GHG emissions from energy supply 
decreased from 2.3% for 2000–2009 to 1.0% for 2010–2019 
(high confidence). This slowing of growth is attributable to further 
improvements in energy efficiency (annually, 1.9% less energy per unit 
of GDP was used globally between 2010 and 2019). Reductions in 
global carbon intensity by –0.2% yr –1 contributed further – reversing 
the trend during 2000 to 2009 (+0.2% yr –1) (medium confidence). 
These carbon intensity improvements were driven by fuel switching 
from coal to gas, reduced expansion of coal capacity, particularly in 
Eastern Asia, and the increased use of renewables. {2.2.4, 2.4.2.1, 
Figure 2.17}

requirements of energy use consistent with enabling well-being for all is between 20 and 50 GJ per capita yr –1 depending on the context. {5.2.2, 5.2.2, Box 5.3, Figure 5.6}GHG emissions in the industry, buildings and transport 
sectors continue to grow, driven by an increase in the global 
demand for products and services (high confidence). These final 
demand sectors make up 44% of global GHG emissions, or 66% when 
the emissions from electricity and heat production are reallocated as 
indirect emissions to related sectors, mainly to industry and buildings. 
Emissions are driven by the large rise in demand for basic materials 
and manufactured products, a global trend of increasing floor space 
per capita, building energy service use, travel distances, and vehicle 
size and weight. Between 2010 and 2019, domestic and international 
aviation were particularly fast growing at average annual rates of 
+3.3% and +3.4%. Global energy efficiencies have improved in 
all three demand sectors, but carbon intensities have not. {2.2.4; 
Figures 2.18 to 2.20}
Providing access to modern energy services universally would 
increase global GHG emissions by, at most, a  few percent 
(medium confidence).  The additional energy demand needed 
to support decent living standards3 for all is estimated to be well 
below current average energy consumption (medium evidence,  high 
agreement). More equitable income distributions can reduce carbon 
emissions, but the nature of this relationship can vary by level of income 
and development (limited evidence,  medium agreement). {2.4.3}
Evidence of rapid energy transitions exists, but only at 
sub-global scales (medium evidence, medium agreement).  
Emerging evidence since the Fifth Assessment Report of the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR5) on past 
energy transitions identifies a growing number of cases of accelerated 
technology diffusion at sub-global scales and describes mechanisms 
by which future energy transitions may occur more quickly than 
those in the past. Important drivers include technology transfer 
and cooperation, intentional policy and financial support, and 
harnessing synergies among technologies within a sustainable energy 
system perspective (medium evidence,  medium agreement). A  fast 
global low-carbon energy transition enabled by finance to facilitate 
low-carbon technology adoption in developing, and particularly in 
least-developed countries, can facilitate achieving climate stabilisation 
targets (robust evidence,  high agreement). {2.5.2, Table 2.5}
Multiple low-carbon technologies have shown rapid progress 
since AR5 – in cost, performance, and adoption – enhancing 
the feasibility of rapid energy transitions (robust evidence, 
high agreement).  The rapid deployment and cost decrease of 
modular technologies like solar, wind, and batteries have occurred 
much faster than anticipated by experts and modelled in previous 
mitigation scenarios (robust evidence, high agreement). The political, 
economic, social, and technical feasibility of solar energy, wind energy 
and electricity storage technologies has improved dramatically over 
the past few years. In contrast, the adoption of nuclear energy and 
carbon capture and storage (CCS) in the electricity sector has been 
slower than the growth rates anticipated in stabilisation scenarios. 
Emerging evidence since AR5 indicates that small-scale technologies 
(e.g., solar, batteries) tend to improve faster and be adopted more 
quickly than large-scale technologies (nuclear, CCS) (medium 
evidence, medium agreement). {2.5.3, 2.5.4, Figures 2.22 and 2.23}
Robust incentives for investment in innovation, especially 
incentives reinforced by national policy and international 
agreements, are central to accelerating low-carbon 
technological change (robust evidence, medium agreement).  
Policies have driven innovation, including instruments for technology 
push (e.g.,  scientific training, research and development) and 
demand pull (e.g.,  carbon pricing, adoption subsidies), as well as 
those promoting knowledge flows and especially technology transfer. 
The magnitude of the scale-up challenge elevates the importance of 
rapid technology development and adoption. This includes ensuring 
participation of developing countries in an enhanced global flow of 
knowledge, skills, experience, and equipment. Also, technology itself 
requires strong financial, institutional, and capacity-building support 
(robust evidence, high agreement). {2.5.4, 2.5, 2.8}
The global wealthiest 10% contribute about 36–45% of 
global GHG emissions (robust evidence, high agreement). 
The  global  10% wealthiest consumers live in all continents, with 
two-thirds in high-income regions and one-third in emerging 
economies (robust evidence, medium agreement). The lifestyle 
consumption emissions of the middle-income and poorest citizens 
in emerging economies are between 5 and 50 times below their 
counterparts in high-income countries (medium evidence, medium 
agreement). Increasing inequality within a  country can exacerbate 
dilemmas of redistribution and social cohesion, and affect the 
willingness of rich and poor to accept lifestyle changes for mitigation 
and policies to protect the environment (medium evidence, medium 
agreement) {2.6.1, 2.6.2, Figure 2.25}
Estimates of future CO 2 emissions from existing fossil fuel 
infrastructures already exceed remaining cumulative net CO 2 
emissions in pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or 
limited overshoot (high confidence).  Assuming variations in 
historical patterns of use and decommissioning, estimated future 
CO2 emissions from existing fossil fuel infrastructure alone are 

infrastructure 850 (600–1100) GtCO 2. This compares to overall 
cumulative net CO 2 emissions until reaching net zero CO 2 of 510 
(330–710) Gt in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or 
limited overshoot, and 890 (640–1160) Gt in pathways that limit 
warming to 2°C (<67%) (high confidence). While most future CO 2 
emissions from existing and currently planned fossil fuel infrastructure 
are situated in the power sector, most remaining fossil fuel CO 2 
emissions in pathways that limit warming to 2°C (<67%) and below 
are from non-electric energy – most importantly from the industry 
and transportation sectors (high confidence). Decommissioning and 
reduced utilisation of existing fossil fuel installations in the power 
sector as well as cancellation of new installations are required to 
align future CO 2 emissions from the power sector with projections 
in these pathways (high confidence). {2.7.2, 2.7.3, Figure  2.26, 
Table 2.6, Table 2.7}A broad range of climate policies, including instruments like 
carbon pricing, play an increasing role in GHG emissions 
reductions. The literature is in broad agreement, but the 
magnitude of the reduction rate varies by the data and 
methodology used, country, and sector (robust evidence, 
high agreement).  Countries with a lower carbon pricing gap (higher 
carbon price) tend to be less carbon intensive (medium confidence). 
{2.8.2, 2.8.3}
Climate-related policies have also contributed to decreasing 
GHG emissions. Policies such as taxes and subsidies for clean 
and public transportation, and renewable policies have 
reduced GHG emissions in some contexts (robust evidence, 
high agreement).  Pollution control policies and legislations that 
go beyond end-of-pipe controls have also had climate co-benefits, 
particularly if complementarities with GHG emissions are considered 
in policy design (medium evidence, medium agreement). Policies on 
AFOLU and sector-related policies such as afforestation can have 
important impacts on GHG emissions (medium evidence, medium 
agreement). {2.8.4}
2.1 Introduction
As demonstrated by the contribution of Working Group I to the Sixth 
Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(AR6 WGI) (IPCC 2021a), greenhouse gas4 (GHG) concentrations 
in the atmosphere and annual anthropogenic GHG  emissions 
continue  to grow and have reached a  historic high, driven mainly 
by continued fossil fuels use (Jackson et al. 2019; Friedlingstein et al. 
2020; Peters et  al. 2020). Unsurprisingly, a  large volume of new 
literature has emerged since AR5 on the trends and underlying drivers 
of anthropogenic GHG emissions. This chapter provides a structured 
assessment of this new literature and establishes the most important 
thematic links to other chapters in this report.

Earth’s surface, by the atmosphere itself, and by clouds. This property causes the greenhouse effect. Water vapour (H 2O), carbon dioxide (CO 2), nitrous oxide (N 2O), 
methane (CH 4), and ozone (O 3) are the primary GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere. Human-made GHGs include sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), and perfluorocarbons (PFCs); see Annex I: Glossary.While AR5 has mostly assessed GHG emissions trends and drivers 
between 1970 and 2010, this assessment focuses on the period 
1990–2019 with the main emphasis on changes since 2010. 
Compared to Chapter  5 in the contribution of WG III to AR5 
(Blanco  et  al. 2014), the scope of the present chapter is broader. 
It presents the historical background of global progress in climate 
change mitigation for the rest of the report and serves as a starting 
point for the assessment of long-term as well as near- and medium-
term mitigation pathways in Chapters 3 and 4, respectively. It also 
provides a systemic perspective on past emissions trends in different 
sectors of the economy (Chapters 6–12), and relates GHG emissions 
trends to past policies (Chapter  13) and observed technological 
development (Chapter  16). There is also a  greater focus on the 
analysis of consumption-based sectoral emissions trends, empirical

evidence of  emissions consequences of behavioural choices and 
lifestyles, and the social aspects of mitigation (Chapter  5). Finally, 
a  completely new section discusses the mitigation implications of 
existing and planned long-lived infrastructure and carbon lock-in.
Figure  2.1 presents the road map of this chapter. It is a  simplified 
illustration of the causal chain driving emissions along the black 
arrows. It also highlights the most important linkages to other 
chapters in this volume (blue lines). The logic of the figure is that the 
main topic of this chapter is GHG emissions trends (discussed only 
in this chapter at such level of detail), hence they are at the top of 
the figure in grey-outlined boxes. The secondary theme is the drivers 
behind these trends, depicted in the second line of grey-outlined 
boxes. Four categories of drivers highlight key issues and guide readers 
to chapters in which more details are presented. Finally, in addition 
to their own motivations and objectives, climate and non-climate 
policies and measures shape the aspirations and activities of actors in 
the main driver categories, as shown in the grey-outlined box below.
Accordingly, the grey-outlined boxes at the top of Figure 2.1 show 
that the first part of the chapter presents GHG emissions from two 
main perspectives: their geographical locations; and the places where 
goods are consumed and services are utilised. A complicated chain of 
drivers underlie these emissions. They are linked across time, space, 
and various segments of the economy and society in complex non-
linear relationships. Sections shown in the second row of grey-outlined 
boxes assess the latest literature and improve the understanding of 
the relative importance of these drivers in mitigating GHG emissions. 
A huge mass of physical capital embodying immense financial assets 
and potentially operating over a  long lifetime produces vast GHG 
emissions. This long-lived infrastructure can be a significant hindrance 
to fast and deep reductions of emissions; it is therefore also shown as 
an important driver. A large range of economic, social, environmental, 
and other policies has been shaping these drivers of GHG emissions 
in the past and are anticipated to influence them in the future, as 
indicated by the grey-outlined policies box and its manifold linkages. 
As noted, blue lines show linkages of sections to other chapters that 
discuss these drivers and their operating mechanisms in detail.
2.2 Past and Present Trends of Territorial 
GHG Emissions
Total anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as discussed 
in this chapter comprise CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion 
and industrial (FFI) processes,5 net CO 2 emissions from land 
use, land-use change, and forestry (CO 2-LULUCF) (often named 
FOLU  – forestry and other land-use  – in previous IPCC reports), 
methane (CH 4), nitrous oxide (N 2O) and fluorinated gases (F-gases) 
comprising hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), 
sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6) as well as nitrogen trifluoride (NF 3). 
There are other major sources of F-gas emissions that are regulated 
under the Montreal Protocol such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) 
and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) that also have considerable 
warming impacts (Figure  2.4), however they are not considered 

contribute climate forcing are only treated very briefly, but a  full 
chapter is devoted to this subject in the Working Group I contribution 
to AR6 (Szopa et al. 2021a; 2021b).
A growing number of global GHG emissions inventories have 
become available since AR5 (Minx et al. 2021). However, only a few 
are comprehensive in their coverage of sectors, countries and gases – 
namely EDGAR (Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research) 
(Crippa et al. 2021), PRIMAP (Potsdam Real-time Integrated Model 
for probabilistic Assessment of emissions Paths) (Gütschow et  al. 
2021a), CAIT (Climate Analysis Indicators Tool) (WRI 2019) and CEDS 
(A Community Emissions Data System for Historical Emissions) (Hoesly 
et al. 2018). None of these inventories presently cover CO 2-LULUCF , 
while CEDS excludes F-gases. For individual gases and sectors, 
additional GHG inventories are available, as shown in Figure 2.2, but 
each has varying system boundaries leading to important differences 
between their respective estimates (Section 2.2.1). Some inventories 
are compiled bottom-up, while others are produced synthetically 
and are dependent on other inventories. A more comprehensive list 
and discussion of different datasets is provided in the Chapter  2 
Supplementary Material (2.SM.1) and in Minx et al. (2021).
Across this report, version 6 of EDGAR (Crippa et al. 2021) provided 
by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, is used 
for a  consistent assessment of GHG emissions trends and drivers. 
It covers anthropogenic releases of CO 2-FFI, CH 4, N2O, and F-gas 
(HFCs, PFCs, SF 6, NF 3) emissions by 228 countries and territories and 
across five sectors and 27 subsectors. EDGAR is chosen because it 
provides the most comprehensive global dataset in its coverage 
of sources, sectors and gases. For transparency, and as part of the 
uncertainty assessment, EDGAR is compared to other global datasets 
in Section 2.2.1 as well as in the Chapter 2 Supplementary Material 
(2.SM.1). For individual country estimates of GHG emissions, it may 
be more appropriate to use inventory data submitted to the United 
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) under 
the common reporting format (CRF) (UNFCCC 2021). However, these 
inventories are only up to date for Annex I countries and cannot be 
used to estimate global or regional totals. As part of the regional 
analysis, a comparison of EDGAR and CRF estimates at the country-
level is provided, where the latter is available (Figure 2.9).
Net CO 2-LULUCF estimates are added to the dataset as the average 
of estimates from three bookkeeping models of land-use emissions 
(Hansis et al. 2015; Houghton and Nassikas 2017; Gasser et al. 2020) 
following the Global Carbon Project (Friedlingstein et al. 2020). This 
is different to AR5, where land-based CO 2 emissions from forest fires, 
peat fires, and peat decay, were used as an approximation of the 
net-flux of CO 2-LULUCF (Blanco et al. 2014). Note that the definition 
of CO 2-LULUCF emissions by global carbon cycle models, as used 
here, differs from IPCC definitions (IPCC 2006) applied in national 
greenhouse gas inventories (NGHGI) for reporting under the climate 
convention (Grassi et al. 2018, 2021) and, similarly, from estimates 
by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) 
for carbon fluxes on forest land (Tubiello et al. 2021). The conceptual 
difference in approaches reflects different scopes. We use the 
global carbon cycle models’ approach for consistency with Working 
Group I (Canadell et  al. 2021) and to comprehensively distinguish 
natural from anthropogenic drivers, while NGHGI generally report 
as anthropogenic all CO 2 fluxes from lands considered managed 
(Section  7.2.2). Finally, note that the CO 2-LULUCF estimate from 
bookkeeping models as provided in this chapter is indistinguishable 
from the CO 2 from agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) 
as reported in Chapter 7, because the CO 2 emissions component from 
agriculture is negligible.
The resulting synthetic dataset used here has undergone additional 
peer review and is publicly available (Minx et al. 2021). Comprehensive 
information about the dataset as well as underlying uncertainties 
(including a  comparison with other datasets) can be found in the 
Supplementary Material to this chapter and in Minx et al. (2021).
In this chapter and the report as a  whole, different GHGs are 
frequently converted into common units of CO 2 equivalent (CO 2-eq) 
emissions using 100-year global warming potentials (GWP100) from 
AR6 WGI (Forster et al. 2021a). This reflects the dominant use in the 
scientific literature and is consistent with decisions made by Parties 
to the Paris Agreement for reporting and accounting of emissions 
and removals (UNFCCC 2019). Other GHG emissions metrics exist, 
all of which, like GWP100, are designed for specific purposes and 
have limitations and uncertainties. The appropriate choice of GHG 
emissions metrics depends on policy objective and context (Myhre 
et  al. 2013; Kolstad et  al. 2015). A  discussion of GHG metrics is 
provided in a Cross-Chapter Box later in the chapter (Cross-Chapter 
Box  2) and at length in the Chapter  2 Supplementary Material. 
Throughout the chapter GHG emissions are reported (in GtCO 2-eq) at 
two significant digits to reflect prevailing uncertainties in emissions 
estimates. Estimates are subject to uncertainty, which we report for 
a 90% confidence interval.
2.2.1 Uncertainties in GHG Emissions
Estimates of historical GHG emissions  – CO 2, CH 4, N 2O and 
F-gases – are uncertain to different degrees. Assessing and reporting 
uncertainties is crucial in order to understand whether available 
estimates are sufficiently robust to answer policy questions  – for 
example, if GHG emissions are still rising, or if a country has achieved 
an emission reduction goal (Marland 2008). These uncertainties can 
be of scientific nature, such as when a  process is not sufficiently 
understood. They also arise from incomplete or unknown parameter 
information (e.g.,  activity data, or emission factors), as well as 
estimation uncertainties from imperfect modelling techniques. There 
are at least three major ways to examine uncertainties in emission 
estimates (Marland et al. 2009): (i) by comparing estimates made by 
independent methods and observations (e.g., comparing atmospheric 
measurements with bottom-up emissions inventory estimates) 
(Saunois et al. 2020; Petrescu et al. 2020a and 2020b; Tian et al. 2020); 
(ii) by comparing estimates from multiple sources and understanding 
sources of variation (Macknick 2011; Andres et  al. 2012; Andrew 
2020; Ciais et al. 2021); and (iii) by evaluating estimates from a single 
source (Hoesly and Smith 2018), for instance via statistical sampling across parameter values (e.g.,  Monni et  al. 2007; Robert J. Andres 
et al. 2014; Tian et al. 2019; Solazzo et al. 2021).
Uncertainty estimates can be rather different depending on the 
method chosen. For example, the range of estimates from multiple 
sources is bounded by their interdependency; they can be lower than 
true structural plus parameter uncertainty, or than estimates made 
by independent methods. In particular, it is important to account for 
potential bias in estimates, which can result from using common 
methodological or parameter assumptions, or from missing sources 
(systemic bias). It is further crucial to account for differences in 
system boundaries – that is, which emissions sources are included 
in a  dataset and which are not, otherwise direct comparisons 
can exaggerate uncertainties (Macknick 2011; Andrew 2020). 
Independent top-down observational constraints are, therefore, 
particularly useful to bound total emission estimates, but are not 
yet capable of verifying emission levels or trends (Petrescu et  al. 
2021a, 2021b). Similarly, uncertainties estimates are influenced by 
specific modelling choices. For example, uncertainty estimates from 
studies on the propagation of uncertainties associated with key input 
parameters (activity data, emissions factors) following the IPCC 
Guidelines (IPCC 2006) are strongly determined by assumptions on 
how these parameters are correlated between sectors, countries, 
and regions (Janssens-Maenhout et  al. 2019; Solazzo et  al. 2021). 
Assuming (full) covariance between source categories, and therefore 
dependence between them, increases uncertainty estimates. 
Estimates allowing for some covariance as in Sollazo et al. (2021) 
also tend to yield higher estimates than the range of values from 
ensemble of dependent inventories (Saunois et al. 2016, 2020).
For this report, a  comprehensive assessment of uncertainties is 
provided in the Supplementary Material (2.SM.2) to this chapter 
based on Minx et al. (2021). The uncertainties reported here combine 
statistical analysis, comparisons of global emissions inventories 
and an expert judgement of the likelihood of results lying outside 
a  defined confidence interval, rooted in an understanding gained 
from the relevant literature. This literature has improved considerably 
since AR5, with a growing number of studies that assess uncertainties 
based on multiple lines of evidence (Saunois et  al. 2016, 2020; 
Tian et al. 2020; Petrescu et al. 2021a, 2021b).
To report the uncertainties in GHG emissions estimates, a  90% 
confidence interval (5th–95th percentile) is adopted – that is, there 
is a 90% likelihood that the true value will be within the provided 
range if the errors have a  Gaussian distribution, and no bias is 
assumed. This is in line with previous reporting in IPCC AR5 (Blanco 
et al. 2014; Ciais et al. 2014). Note that national emissions inventory 
submissions to the UNFCCC are requested to report uncertainty using 
a  95% confidence interval. The use of this broader uncertainty 
interval implies, however, a  relatively high degree of knowledge 
about the uncertainty structure of the associated data, particularly 
regarding the distribution of uncertainty in the tails of the probability 
distributions. Such a high degree of knowledge is not present over all 
regions, emission sectors and species considered here.
Based on the assessment of relevant uncertainties above, a constant, 
relative, global uncertainty estimates for GHGs are applied at a 90%

 confidence interval that range from relatively low values for CO 2-FFI 
(±8%), to intermediate values for CH 4 and F-gases (±30%), to higher 
values for N 2O (±60%) and CO 2-LULUCF (±70%). Uncertainties 
for aggregated total GHG emissions in terms of CO 2-eq emissions 
are calculated as the square root of the squared sums of absolute 
uncertainties for individual gases (taking F-gases together), using 
GWP100 to weight emissions of non-CO 2 gases but excluding 
uncertainties in the metric itself.
This assessment of uncertainties is broadly in line with AR5 WGIII 
(Blanco et al. 2014), but revises individual uncertainty judgements in line with the more recent literature (Saunois et  al. 2016, 2020; 
Janssens-Maenhout et al. 2019; Friedlingstein et al. 2020; Tian et al. 
2020; Solazzo et al. 2021) as well as the underlying synthetic analysis 
provided here (e.g.,  Figures 2.2 and 2.3 in this chapter; and Minx 
et  al. 2021). As such, reported changes in these estimates do not 
reflect changes in the underlying uncertainties, but rather a change 
in expert judgement based on an improved evidence base in the 
scientific literature. Uncertainty estimates for CO 2-FFI and N 2O remain 
unchanged compared to AR5. The change in the uncertainty estimates 
for CH 4 from 20% to 30% is justified by larger uncertainties reported 
for EDGAR emissions (Janssens-Maenhout et al. 2019; Solazzo et al. Figure 2.2 (continued): Estimates of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions from different data sources 1970–2019.  Panel (a): CO 2 FFI emissions

2021) as well as the wider literature (Kirschke et al. 2013; Tubiello 
et  al. 2015; Saunois et  al. 2016, 2020). As AR6  – in contrast to 
AR5  – uses CO 2-LULUCF data from global bookkeeping models, 
the respective uncertainty estimate is based on the reporting in the 
underlying literature (Friedlingstein et al. 2020) as well as Working 
Group I (Canadell et al. 2021). The 70% uncertainty value is at the 
higher end of the range considered in AR5 (Blanco et al. 2014).
Finally, for F-gas emissions top-down atmospheric measurements 
from the 2018 World Meteorological Organization’s (WMO) Scientific 
Assessment of Ozone Depletion (Engel and Rigby 2018; Montzka and 
Velders 2018) are compared to the data used in this report (Crippa 
et al. 2021; Minx et al. 2021) as shown in Figure 2.3. Due to the general 
absence of natural F-gas fluxes, there is a sound understanding of global 
and regional F-gas emissions from top-down estimates of atmospheric 
measurements with small and well-understood measurement, lifetime 
and transport model uncertainties (Engel and Rigby 2018; Montzka 
and Velders 2018). However, when species are aggregated into total 
F-gas emissions, EDGARv6.0 emissions are around 10% lower than the 
WMO 2018 values throughout, with larger differences for individual 
F-gas species, and further discrepancies when comparing to older 
EDGAR versions. Based on this, the overall uncertainties for aggregate F-gas emissions is judged conservatively at 30%  – 10  percentage 
points higher than in AR5 (Blanco et al. 2014).
Aggregate uncertainty across all GHGs is approximately ±11% 
depending on the composition of gases in a particular year. AR5 applied 
a  constant uncertainty estimates of ±10% for total GHG emissions. 
The upwards revision applied to the uncertainties of CO 2-LULUCF , 
CH4 and F-gas emissions therefore has a limited overall effect on the 
assessment of GHG emissions.
GHG emissions metrics such as GWP100 have their own uncertainties, 
which has been largely neglected in the literature so far. Minx et al. 
(2021) report the uncertainty in GWP100 metric values as ±50% for 
methane and other short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs), and ±40% 
for  non-CO 2 gases with longer atmospheric lifetimes (specifically, 
those with lifetimes longer than 20 years). If uncertainties in GHG 
metrics are considered, and are assumed independent (which may lead 
to an underestimate) the overall uncertainty of total GHG emissions 
in 2019 increases from ±11% to ±13%. Metric uncertainties are not 
further considered in this chapter, but are referred to in Cross-Chapter 
Box 2 in this chapter, and Chapter 2 Supplementary Material on GHG 
metrics (2.SM.3).

The most appropriate metric to aggregate GHG emissions depends 
on the objective (Cross-Chapter Box 2). One such objective can be to 
understand the contribution of emissions in any given year to warming, 
while another can be to understand the contribution of cumulative 
emissions over an extended time period to warming. In Figure 2.4 the 
modelled warming from emissions of each gas or group of gases is 
also shown – calculated using the reduced-complexity climate model 
Finite Amplitude Impulse Response (FaIR) model v1.6, which has been 
calibrated to match several aspects of the overall WGI assessment 
(Forster et al. 2021a; specifically Cross-Chapter Box 7 in Chapter 10 
therein). Additionally, its temperature response to emissions with 
shorter atmospheric lifetimes such as aerosols, methane or ozone 
has been adjusted to broadly match those presented in Szopa et al. 
(2021a). There are some differences in actual warming compared to 
the GWP100 weighted emissions of each gas (Figure 2.4), in particular 
a greater contribution from CH 4 emissions to historical warming. This is consistent with warming from CH 4 being short-lived and hence 
having a  more pronounced effect in the near-term during a  period 
of rising emissions. Nonetheless, Figure 2.4 highlights that emissions 
weighted by GWP100 do not provide a  fundamentally different 
information about the contribution of individual gases than modelled 
actual warming over the historical period, when emissions of most 
GHGs have been rising continuously, with CO 2 being the dominant 
and CH 4 being the second most important contributor to GHG-induced 
warming. Other metrics such as GWP* (or GWP star) (Cain et  al. 
2019) offer an even closer resemblance between cumulative CO 2-eq 
emissions and temperature change. Such a  metric may be more 
appropriate when the key objective is to track temperature change 
when emissions are falling, as in mitigation scenarios.

Comprehensive mitigation policy relies on consideration of all anthropogenic forcing agents, which differ widely in their atmospheric 
lifetimes and impacts on the climate system. GHG emission metrics6 provide simplified information about the effects that emissions 
of different GHGs have on global temperature or other aspects of climate, usually expressed relative to the effect of emitting CO 2 
(see emission metrics in Annex I: Glossary). This information can inform prioritisation and management of trade-offs in mitigation 
policies and emission targets for non-CO 2 gases relative to CO 2, as well as for baskets of gases expressed in CO 2-eq. This assessment 
builds on the evaluation of GHG emission metrics from a physical science perspective by WGI (Forster et al. 2021b). For additional 
details and supporting references, see Chapter 2 Supplementary Material (2.SM.3) and Annex II.8.
The global warming potential (GWP) and the global temperature change potential (GTP) were the main metrics assessed in AR5 (Myhre 
et al. 2013; Kolstad et al. 2014). The GWP with a lifetime of 100 years (GWP100) continues to be the dominant metric used in the scientific 
literature on mitigation assessed by WGIII. The assessment by WGI (Forster et al. 2021) includes updated values for these metrics based 
on updated scientific understanding of the response of the climate system to emissions of different gases, including changing background 
concentrations. It also assesses new metrics published since AR5. Metric values in AR6 include climate-carbon cycle feedbacks by default; 
this provides an important update and clarification from AR5 which reported metric values both with and without such feedbacks.
The choice of metric, including time horizon, should reflect the policy objectives for which the metric is applied (Plattner et al. 2009). 
Recent studies confirm earlier findings that the GWP is consistent with a cost-benefit framework (Kolstad et al. 2014), which implies 
weighting each emission based on the economic damages that this emission will cause over time, or conversely, the avoided damages 
from avoiding that emission. The GWP time horizon can be linked to the discount rate used to evaluate economic damages from each 
emission. For methane, GWP100 implies a social discount rate of about 3–5% depending on the assumed damage function, whereas 
GWP20 implies a much higher discount rate, greater than 10% (medium confidence) (Mallapragada and Mignone 2019; Sarofim and 
Giordano 2018). The dynamic GTP is aligned with a cost-effectiveness framework, as it weights each emission based on its contribution 
to global warming in a specified future year (e.g., the expected year of peak warming for a given temperature goal). This implies 
a shrinking time horizon and increasing relative importance of SLCF emissions as the target year is approached (Johansson 2011; 
Aaheim and Mideksa 2017). The GTP with a static time horizon (e.g., GTP100) is not well-matched to either a cost-benefit or a cost-
effectiveness framework, as the year for which the temperature outcome is evaluated would not match the year of peak warming, nor 
the overall damages caused by each emission (Edwards and Trancik 2014; Strefler et al. 2014; Mallapragada and Mignone 2017).

Cross-Chapter Box 2 (continued)
A number of studies since AR5 have evaluated the impact of various GHG emission metrics and time horizons on the global economic 
costs of limiting global average temperature change to a pre-determined level (e.g. Strefler et al. 2014; Harmsen et al. 2016; Tanaka 
et al. 2021) (see 2.SM.3 for additional detail). These studies indicate that, for mitigation pathways that limit warming to 2°C (<67%) 
above pre-industrial levels or lower, using GWP100 to inform cost-effective abatement choices between gases would achieve such 
long-term temperature goals at close to least global cost within a few percent (high confidence). Using the dynamic GTP instead of 
GWP100 could reduce global mitigation costs by a few percent in theory (high confidence), but the ability to realise those cost savings 
depends on the temperature limit, policy foresight and flexibility in abatement choices as the weighting of SLCF emissions increases 
over time (medium confidence) (van den Berg et al. 2015; Huntingford et al. 2015). Similar benefits as for the dynamic GTP might be 
obtained by regularly reviewing and potentially updating the time horizon used for GWP in light of actual emissions trends compared 
to climate goals (Tanaka et al. 2020).
The choice of metric and time horizon can affect the distribution of costs and the timing of abatement between countries and sectors 
in cost-effective mitigation strategies. Sector-specific lifecycle assessments find that different emission metrics and different time 
horizons can lead to divergent conclusions about the effectiveness of mitigation strategies that involve reductions of one gas but an 
increase of another gas with a different lifetime (e.g., Tanaka et al. 2019). Assessing the sensitivity of conclusions to different emission 
metrics and time horizons can support more robust decision-making (Levasseur et al. 2016; Balcombe et al. 2018) (see 2.SM.3 for 
details). Sectoral and national perspectives on GHG emission metrics may differ from a global least-cost perspective, depending on 
other policy objectives and equity considerations, but the literature does not provide a consistent framework for assessing GHG 
emission metrics based on equity principles.
Literature since AR5 has emphasised that the GWP100 is not well-suited to estimating the warming effect at specific points in time 
from sustained SLCF emissions (e.g., Allen et al. 2016; Cain et al. 2019; Collins et al. 2019). This is because the warming caused by 
an individual SLCF emission pulse diminishes over time and hence, unlike CO 2, the warming from SLCF emissions that are sustained 
over multiple decades to centuries depends mostly on their ongoing rate of emissions rather than their cumulative emissions. Treating 
all gases interchangeably based on GWP100 within a stated emissions target therefore creates ambiguity about actual global 
temperature outcomes (Fuglestvedt et al. 2018; Denison et al. 2019). Supplementing economy-wide emission targets with information 
about the expected contribution from individual gases to such targets would reduce the ambiguity in global temperature outcomes.
Recently developed step/pulse metrics such as the combined global temperature change potential (CGTP) (Collins et al. 2019) and 
GWP* (Allen et al. 2018; Cain et al. 2019) recognise that a sustained increase/decrease in the rate of SLCF emissions has a similar 
effect on global surface temperature over multiple decades as a one-off pulse emission/removal of CO 2. These metrics use this 
relationship to calculate the CO 2 emissions or removals that would result in roughly the same temperature change as a sustained 
change in the rate of SLCF emissions (CGTP) over a given time period, or as a varying time series of CH 4 emissions (GWP*). From 
a mitigation perspective, these metrics indicate greater climate benefits from rapid and sustained methane reductions over the next 
few decades than if such reductions are weighted by GWP100, while conversely, sustained methane increases have greater adverse 
climate impacts (Collins et al. 2019; Lynch et al. 2020). The ability of these metrics to relate changes in emission rates of short-lived 
gases to cumulative CO 2 emissions makes them well-suited, in principle, to estimating the effect on the remaining carbon budget from 
more, or less, ambitious SLCF mitigation over multiple decades compared to a given reference scenario (high confidence) (Collins et al. 
2019; Forster et al. 2021).
The potential application of GWP* in wider climate policy (e.g., to inform equitable and ambitious emission targets or to support 
sector-specific mitigation policies) is contested, although relevant literature is still limited (Rogelj and Schleussner 2019, 2021; 
Schleussner et al. 2019; Allen et al. 2021; Cain et al. 2021). Whereas GWP and GTP describe the marginal effect of each emission 
relative to the absence of that emission, GWP* describes the equivalent CO 2 emissions that would give the same temperature 
change as an emissions trajectory of the gas considered, starting at a (user-determined) reference point. The warming based on 
those cumulative CO 2-equivalent emission at any point in time is relative to the warming caused by emissions of that gas before the 
reference point. Because of their different focus, GWP* and GWP100 can equate radically different CO 2 emissions to the same CH 4 
emissions: rapidly declining CH 4 emissions have a negative CO 2-warming-equivalent value based on GWP* (rapidly declining SLCF 
emissions result in declining temperature, relative to the warming caused by past SLCF emissions at a previous point in time) but a 
positive CO 2-equivalent value based on GWP or GTP (each SLCF emission from any source results in increased future radiative forcing 
and global average temperature than without this emission, regardless of whether the rate of SLCF emissions is rising or declining). 
The different focus in these metrics can have important distributional consequences, depending on how they are used to inform 
emission targets (Lynch et al. 2021; Reisinger et al. 2021), but this has only begun to be explored in the scientific literature.
Cross-Chapter Box 2 (continued)
A key insight from WGI is that, for a  given emissions scenario, different metric choices can alter the time at which net zero 
GHG emissions are calculated to be reached, or whether net zero GHG emissions are reached at all (2.SM.3). From a mitigation 
perspective, this implies that changing GHG emission metrics but retaining the same numerical CO 2-equivalent emissions targets 
would result in different climate outcomes. For example, achieving a balance of global anthropogenic GHG emissions and removals, as 
stated in Article 4.1 of the Paris Agreement could, depending on the GHG emission metric used, result in different peak temperatures 
and in either stable, or slowly or rapidly declining temperature after the peak (Allen et al. 2018; Fuglestvedt et al. 2018; Tanaka and 
O’Neill 2018; Schleussner et al. 2019). A fundamental change in GHG emission metrics used to monitor achievement of existing 
emission targets could therefore inadvertently change their intended climate outcomes or ambition, unless existing emission targets 
are re-evaluated at the same time (very high confidence).
The WGIII contribution to AR6 reports aggregate emissions and removals using updated GWP100 values from AR6 WGI unless stated 
otherwise. This choice was made on both scientific grounds (the alignment of GWP100 with a cost-benefit perspective under social 
discount rates and its performance from a global cost-effectiveness perspective) and for procedural reasons, including continuity 
with past IPCC reports and alignment with decisions under the Paris Agreement Rulebook (Annex II.8). A key constraint in the choice 
of metric is also that the literature assessed by WGIII predominantly uses GWP100 and often does not provide sufficient detail 
on emissions and abatement of individual gases to allow translation into different metrics. Presenting such information routinely 
in mitigation studies would enable the application of more diverse GHG emission metrics in future assessments to evaluate their 
contribution to different policy objectives.
All metrics have limitations and uncertainties, given that they simplify the complexity of the physical climate system and its response 
to past and future GHG emissions. No single metric is well-suited to all applications in climate policy. For this reason, the WGIII 
contribution to AR6 reports emissions and mitigation options for individual gases where possible; CO 2-equivalent emissions are 
reported in addition to individual gas emissions where this is judged to be policy-relevant. This approach aims to reduce the ambiguity 
regarding mitigation potentials for specific gases and actual climate outcomes over time arising from the use of any specific GHG 
emission metric.
2.2.2 Trends in the Global GHG Emissions Trajectories 
and Short-lived Climate Forcers
2.2.2.1 Anthropogenic Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trends
Global GHG emissions continued to rise since AR5, but the rate of 
emissions growth slowed (high confidence). GHG emissions reached 

CO2  emissions from the FFI were 38 (±3.0) Gt, CO 2 from LULUCF 
6.6 ± 4.6 Gt, CH 4 11 ± 3.2 GtCO 2-eq, N 2O 2.7 ± 1.6 GtCO 2-eq and 
F-gases 1.4 ± 0.41 GtCO 2-eq. There is high confidence that average 
annual GHG emissions for the last decade (2010–2019) were the 
highest on record in terms of aggregate CO 2-eq emissions, but low 
confidence for annual emissions in 2019 as uncertainties are large 
considering the size and composition of observed increases in the 
most recent years (UNEP 2020a; Minx et al. 2021).
GHG emissions levels in 2019 were higher compared to 10 and 

higher than in 2010 (53 ± 5.7 GtCO 2-eq) (the last year of AR5 
reporting) and about 54% (21 GtCO 2-eq) higher than in 1990 
(38 ± 4.8 GtCO 2-eq) (the baseline year of the Kyoto Protocol and 
frequent nationally determined contribution (NDC) reference). GHG 
emissions growth slowed compared to the previous decade (high 
confidence): From 2010 to 2019, GHG emissions grew on average 
by about 1.3% per year compared to an average annual growth of 2.1% between 2000 and 2009. Nevertheless the absolute increase 
in average annual GHG emissions for 2010–2019 compared to 
2000–2009 was 9.1 GtCO 2-eq and, as such, the largest observed in 
the data since 1970 (Table 2.1) – and most likely in human history 
(Friedlingstein et al. 2020; Gütschow et al. 2021b). Decade-by-decade 
growth in average annual GHG emissions was observed across all 
(groups of) gas as shown in Table 2.1, but for N 2O and CO 2-LULUCF 
emissions this is much more uncertain.
Reported total annual GHG emission estimates differ between 
the WGIII contributions in AR5 (Blanco et  al. 2014) and AR6 
(this chapter) mainly due to differing global warming potentials (high 
confidence). For the year 2010, total GHG emissions were estimated 
at 49 ± 4.9 GtCO 2-eq in AR5 (Blanco et al. 2014), while we report 

weighted based on GWP100 values from IPCC’s Second Assessment 
Report. Applying those GWP values to the 2010 emissions from AR6 
yields 50 GtCO 2-eq (Forster et al. 2021a). Hence, observed differences 
are mainly due to the use of most recent GWP values, which have 
higher warming potentials for methane (29% higher for biogenic and 
42% higher for fugitive methane) and 12% lower values for nitrous 
oxide (Cross-Chapter Box 2 in this chapter).
Emissions growth has been persistent but varied in pace across gases. 
The average annual emission levels of the last decade (2010–2019) 
were higher than in any previous decade for each group of GHGs: 
CO2, CH 4, N2O, and F-gases (high confidence). Since 1990, CO 2-FFI 
have grown by 67% (15 GtCO 2-eq), CH 4 by 29% (2.4 GtCO 2-eq), 
and N 2O by 33% (0.65 GtCO 2-eq), respectively (Figure 2.5). Growth 
in fluorinated gases (F-gas) has been by far the highest with about 
254% (1.0 GtCO 2-eq), but it occurred from low levels. In 2019, 
total F-gas levels were no longer negligible with a share of 2.3% of 
global GHG emissions. Note that the F-gases reported here do not 
include CFCs and HCFCs, which are groups of substances regulated under the Montreal Protocol. The aggregate CO 2-eq emissions of 
HFCs, HCFCs and CFCs were each approximately equal in 2016, 
with a  smaller contribution from PFCs, SF 6, NF 3 and some more 
minor F-gases. Therefore, the GWP-weighted F-gas emissions 
reported here (HFCs, PFCs, SF 6, NF 3), which are dominated by the 
HFCs, represent less than half of the overall CO 2-eq F-gas emissions 
in 2016 (Figure 2.3).Table 2.1 | Total anthropogenic GHG emissions (GtCO 2-eq yr –1) 1990–2019. CO 2 from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes (FFI); CO 2 from Land Use, Land

The only exception to these patterns of GHG emissions growth is net 
anthropogenic CO 2-LULUCF emissions, where there is no statistically 
significant trend due to high uncertainties in estimates (Figures 2.2 and 
2.5; Chapter 2 Supplementary Material). While the average estimate 
from the bookkeeping models report a  slightly increasing trend in 
emissions, NGHGI and FAOSTAT estimates show a slightly decreasing 
trend, which diverges in recent years (Figure 2.2). Similarly, trends in 
CO2-LULUCF estimates from individual bookkeeping models differ: 
while two models (BLUE and OSCAR) show a sustained increase in 
emissions levels since the mid-1990s, emissions from the third model 
(Houghton and Nassikas (HN)) declined (Figure 2.2 in this chapter; 
Friedlingstein et al. 2020). Differences in accounting approaches and 
their impacts CO 2 emissions estimates from land use is covered in 
Chapter  7 and in the Chapter  2 Supplementary Material (2.SM.2). 
Note that anthropogenic net emissions from bioenergy are covered 
by the CO 2-LULUCF estimates presented here.
The CO 2-FFI share in total CO 2-eq emissions has plateaued at about 
65% in recent years and its growth has slowed considerably since 
AR5 (high confidence). The CO 2-FFI emissions grew at 1.1% during 
the 1990s and 2.5% during the 2000s. For the last decade (2010s) – 
not covered by AR5 – this rate dropped to 1.2%. This included a short 
period between 2014 and 2016 with little or no growth in CO 2-FFI 
emissions, mainly due to reduced emissions from coal combustion (Jackson et al. 2016; Qi et al. 2016; Peters et al. 2017a; Canadell et al. 
2021). Subsequently, CO 2-FFI emissions started to rise again (Peters 
et al. 2017b; Figueres et al. 2018; Peters et al. 2020).
Starting in the spring of 2020 a major break in global emissions 
trends was observed due to lockdown policies implemented in 
response to the COVID-19 pandemic (high confidence) (Forster 
et al. 2020; Le Quéré et al. 2020, 2021; Z. Liu et al. 2020b; Bertram 
et  al. 2021). Overall, global CO 2-FFI emissions are estimated 
to have declined by 5.8% (5.1%–6.3%) in 2020, or about 2.2 
(1.9–2.4)  GtCO 2 in total (Friedlingstein et  al. 2020; Z. Liu et  al. 
2020b; BP 2021; Crippa et al. 2021; IEA 2021a). This exceeds any 
previous global emissions decline since 1970, both in relative 
and absolute terms (Figure 2.6). Daily emissions, estimated based 
on activity and power-generation data, declined substantially 
compared to 2019 during periods of economic lockdown, 
particularly in April 2020 – as shown in Figure 2.6 – but rebounded 
by the end of 2020 (medium confidence) (Le Quéré et  al. 2020, 
2021; Z. Liu et  al. 2020b). Impacts were differentiated by sector, 
with road transport and aviation particularly affected. Inventories 
estimate the total power sector CO 2 reduction from 2019 to 2020 
at 3% (IEA 2021a) and 4.5% (Crippa et al. 2021). Approaches that 
predict near real-time estimates of the power sector reduction are 
more uncertain and estimates range more widely, between 1.8%

(Bertram et  al. 2021); the latter taking into account the over-
proportional reduction of coal generation due to low gas prices 
and merit order effects. Due to the very recent nature of this event, 
it remains unclear what the exact short- and long-term impacts on 
future global emissions trends will be.
From 1850 until around 1950, anthropogenic CO 2 emissions 
were mainly (>50%) from land use, land-use change and forestry 
(Figure 2.7). Over the past half-century CO 2 emissions from LULUCF 
have remained relatively constant around 5.1 ± 3.6 GtCO 2 but with 
a large spread across estimates (Le Quéré et al. 2018a; Friedlingstein 
et al. 2019, 2020). By contrast, global annual FFI-CO 2 emissions have 
continuously grown since 1850, and since the 1960s from a decadal 
average of 11 ± 0.9 GtCO 2 to 36 ± 2.9 GtCO 2 during 2010–2019 
(Table 2.1).
Cumulative CO 2 emissions since 1850 reached 2400 ± 240 GtCO 2 
in 2019 (high confidence).7 More than half (62%) of total emissions 
from 1850 to 2019 occurred since 1970 (1500 ± 140 GtCO 2), 
about 42% since 1990 (1000 ± 90 GtCO 2) and about 17% since 

et al. 2020; Canadell et al. 2021) (Figure 2.7). Emissions in the last 
decade are about the same size as the remaining carbon budget of 

and between one-third and half the 1150 ± 220 (1350, 1700) GtCO 2 
for limiting global warming below 2°C with a  67% (50%, 33%) 
probability, respectively (medium confidence) (Canadell et al. 2021). 

uncertainty in the CO 2 fluxes between the atmosphere and the ocean and land reservoirs individually, particularly on an annual basis, as well as the difficulty of updating 
the emissions from land-use change.At current (2019) levels of emissions, it would only take 8 (2–15) 
and 25 (18–35)  years to emit the equivalent amount of CO 2 
for a  67th  percentile 1.5°C and 2°C remaining carbon budget, 
respectively. Related discussions of carbon budgets, short-term 
ambition in the context of Nationally Determined Contributions 
(NDCs), pathways to limiting warming to well below 2°C and carbon 
dioxide removals are mainly discussed in Chapters 3, 4, and 12, but 
also Section 2.7 of this chapter.
Even when taking uncertainties into account, historical emissions 
between 1850 and 2019 constitute a  large share of total carbon 
budgets from 2020 onwards for limiting warming to 1.5°C with 
a 50% probability as well as for limiting warming to 2°C with a 67% 
probability. Based on central estimates only, historical cumulative 
net CO 2 emissions between 1850–2019 amount to about four fifths 
of the total carbon budget for a 50% probability of limiting global 
warming to 1.5°C (central estimate about 2900 GtCO 2), and to 
about two thirds of the total carbon budget for a 67% probability 
to limit global warming to 2°C (central estimate about 3550 GtCO 2). 
The carbon budget is the maximum amount of cumulative net 
global anthropogenic CO 2 emissions that would result in limiting 
global warming to a given level with a given likelihood, taking into 
account the effect of other anthropogenic climate forcers. This is 
referred to as the total carbon budget when expressed starting from 
the pre-industrial period, and as the remaining carbon budget when 
expressed from a  recent specified date. The total carbon budgets 
reported here are the sum of historical emissions from 1850 to 2019 
and the remaining carbon budgets from 2020 onwards, which extend

Canadell et al. (2021).
until global net zero CO 2 emissions are reached. Uncertainties for 
total carbon budgets have not been assessed and could affect the 
specific calculated fractions (IPCC 2021 [Working Group 1 SPM], 
Canadell et al., 2021 [Working Group 1 Ch5]).
Comparisons between historic GHG emissions and baseline 
projections provide increased evidence that global emissions are 
not tracking high-end scenarios (Hausfather and Peters 2020), and 
rather followed ‘middle-of-the-road’ scenario narratives in the earlier 
series, and by combinations of ‘global-sustainability’ and ‘middle-of-
the-road’ narratives in the most recent series (IPCC Special Report 
on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways 
(SSP)-baselines) (Pedersen et al. 2020; Strandsbjerg Tristan Pedersen 
et al. 2021). As countries increasingly implement climate policies and 
technology costs continue to evolve, it is expected that emissions 
will continually shift away from scenarios that assume no climate 
policy but remain insufficient to limit warming to below 2°C (Vrontisi 
et  al. 2018; Hausfather and Peters 2020; Roelfsema et  al. 2020; 
UNEP 2020b).
The literature since AR5 suggests that compared to historical trends 
baseline scenarios might be biased towards higher levels of fossil 
fuel use compared to what is observed historically (Cross-Chapter 
Box  1 in Chapter  1; Ritchie and Dowlatabadi 2017, 2018; Ritchie 
2019; Creutzig et al. 2021;). Ritchie and Dowlatabadi (2017) show 
that per-capita primary energy consumption in baseline scenarios tends to increase at rates faster than those observed in the long-term 
historical evidence – particularly in terms of coal use. For example, 
SSP5 envisions a six-fold increase in per capita coal use by 2100 – 
against flat long-term historical observations  – while the most 
optimistic baseline scenario SSP1-Sustainability is associated with 
coal consumption that is broadly in line with historical long-term 
trends (Ritchie and Dowlatabadi 2017). In contrast, models have 
struggled to reproduce historical upscaling of wind and solar and 
other granular energy technologies (Wilson et al. 2013; van Sluisveld 
et al. 2015; Creutzig et al. 2017; Shiraki and Sugiyama 2020; Sweerts 
et al. 2020; Wilson et al. 2020b).
2.2.2.2 Other Short-lived Climate Forcers (SLCFs)
There are other emissions with shorter atmospheric lifetimes that 
contribute to climate changes. Some of them (aerosols, sulphur 
emissions or organic carbon) reduce forcing, while others  – such 
as black carbon, carbon monoxide or non-methane volatile organic 
compounds (NMVOC)  – contribute to warming (Figure  2.4) as 
assessed in WGI (Forster et al. 2021c; Szopa et al. 2021a). Many of 
these other SLCFs are co-emitted during combustion processes in 
power plants, cars, trucks, airplanes, but also during wildfires and 
household activities such as traditional cooking with open biomass 
burning. As these co-emissions have implications for net warming, 
they are also considered in long-term emission reduction scenarios 
as covered in the literature (Harmsen et al. 2020; Rauner et al. 2020b; 
Figure 2.8 | Air pollution emissions by major sectors from CEDS (1970–2019) and EDGAR (1970–2015) inventories.  Source: Crippa et al. (2019a, 2018); 
O’Rourke et al. (2020); McDuffie et al. (2020).
Smith et al. 2020; Vandyck et al. 2020) as well as Chapter 3 of this 
report. These air pollutants are also detrimental to human health 
(e.g.,  Lelieveld et  al. 2015, 2018; Vohra et  al. 2021). For example, 
Lelieveld et  al. (2015) estimate a  total of 3.3 (1.6–4.8) million 
premature deaths in 2010 from outdoor air pollution. Reducing 
air pollutants in the context of climate policies therefore leads to 
substantial co-benefits of mitigation efforts (Von Stechow et al. 2015; 
Rao et al. 2017; Lelieveld et al. 2019; Rauner et al. 2020a). Here we 
briefly outline the major trends in emissions of SLCFs.
Conventional air pollutants that are subject to significant emission 
controls in many countries include sulphur dioxide (SO 2), nitrogen 
oxides (NO x), black carbon (BC) and carbon monoxide (CO). From 

to reductions in energy systems (Figure 2.8). Reductions in BC and 
CO emissions appear to have occurred over the same period, but 
trends are less certain due to the large contribution of emissions 
from poorly quantified traditional biofuel use. Emissions of CH 4, OC 
and NMVOC have remained relatively stable in the past five years. 
OC and NMVOC may have plateaued, although there is additional 
uncertainty due to sources of NMVOCs that may be missing in current 
inventories (McDonald et al. 2018).
2.2.3 Regional GHG Emissions Trends
Regional contributions to global GHG emissions have shifted since 
the beginning of the international climate negotiations in the 1990s 
(high confidence). As shown in Figure  2.9, developed countries 
(North America, Europe, and Australia, Japan, New Zealand) as 
a group have not managed to reduce GHG emissions substantially, 
with fairly stable levels at about 15 GtCO 2-eq yr –1 between 1990 
and 2010, while countries in Asia and Pacific (Eastern Asia, Southern 
Asia, and South-East Asia and Pacific) have rapidly increased their 
share of global GHG emissions  – particularly since the 2000s 
(Jackson et al. 2019; Peters et al. 2020; UNEP 2020c; Crippa et al. 
2021; IEA 2021b).
Most global GHG emission growth occurred in Asia and Pacific, which 
accounted for 77% of the net 21 GtCO 2-eq increase in GHG emissions 
since 1990, and 83% of the net 6.5 GtCO 2-eq increase since 2010.8 
Africa contributed 11% of GHG emissions growth since 1990 (2.3 
GtCO 2-eq) and 10% (0.7 GtCO 2-eq) since 2010. The Middle East 
contributed 10% of GHG emissions growth since 1990 (2.1 GtCO 2-
eq) and also 10% (0.7 GtCO 2-eq) since 2010. Latin America and the 
Caribbean contributed 11% of GHG emissions growth since 1990 
(2.2 GtCO 2-eq), and 5% (0.3 GtCO 2-eq) since 2010. Two regions, 
Developed Countries, and Eastern Europe and West Central Asia, 
reduced emissions overall since 1990, by –1.6  GtCO 2-eq and –0.8 
GtCO 2-eq, respectively. However, emissions in the latter started 
to grow again since 2010, contributing to 5% of the global GHG 
emissions change (0.3 GtCO 2-eq).

to individual countries. Change in GHG emissions that can be easily assigned to regions is 20.3 of 20.8 GtCO 2-eq for 1990–2019 and 6.3 of 6.5 GtCO 2-eq for 2010–2019.

between 2010 and 2019 compared to 1990–2010, with the 
exception of Eastern Europe and West Central Asia. Global 
emissions changes tend to be driven by a  limited number of 
countries, principally the G20 Group (Friedlingstein et  al. 2020; 
UNEP 2020c; Xia et al. 2021). For instance, the slowing of global 
GHG emissions between 2010 and 2019, compared to the previous 
decade, was primarily triggered by substantial reductions in GHG 
emissions growth in China. Ten countries jointly contributed about 
75% of the net 6.5 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 increase in GHG emissions during 
2010–2019, of which two countries contributed more than 50% 
(Figure 2.9) (see also Minx et al., 2021; Crippa et al., 2021).
GHG and CO 2-FFI levels diverge starkly between countries and regions 
(high confidence) (Jackson et  al. 2019; Friedlingstein et  al. 2020; 
UNEP 2020c; Crippa et  al. 2021). Developed Countries sustained 
high levels of per capita CO 2-FFI emissions at 9.5 tCO 2 per capita in 

than double that of three developing regions: 4.4 (0.3–12.8) tCO 2 
per  capita in Asia and Pacific; 1.2  (0.03–8.5) tCO 2 per  capita in 
Africa; and 2.7 (0.3–24) tCO 2 per capita in Latin America.9 Per capita 
CO2-FFI emissions were 9.9 (0.89–15) tCO 2 per  capita in Eastern 
Europe and West Central Asia, and 8.6 (0.36–38) tCO 2 per capita in 
the Middle East. CO 2-FFI emissions in the three developing regions 
together grew by 26% between 2010 and 2019, compared to 260% 
between 1990 and 2010, while in Developed Countries emissions 
contracted by 9.9% between 2010–2019 and by 9.6% between 
1990–2010.
Least-Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States 
contributed only a negligible proportion of historic GHG emissions 
growth and have the lowest per capita emissions. As of 2019 Least 
Developed Countries contribute 3.3% of global GHG emissions, 
excluding LULUCF CO 2, despite making up 13% of the global 
population. Small Island Developing States contributed 0.6% of 
global GHG emissions in 2019, excluding LULUCF CO 2, with 0.9% 
of the global population. Since the start of the industrial revolution in 

total cumulative CO 2 emissions, while Small Island Developing States 
contributed 0.5% (Figure  2.10). Conversely, Developed Countries 
have the highest share of historic cumulative emissions (Rocha 
et  al. 2015; Gütschow et  al. 2016; Matthews 2016), contributing 
approximately 57% (Figure 2.10), followed by Asia and Pacific (21%), 
Eastern Europe and West Central Asia (9%), Latin America and the 
Caribbean (4%), the Middle East (3%), and Africa (3%). Developed 
Countries still have the highest share of historic cumulative emissions 
(45%) when CO 2-LULUCF emissions are included, which typically 
account for a higher proportion of emissions in developing regions 
(Figure 2.10).

Figure 2.10 | Different perspectives on historic emissions and equity. Panel (a) shows the regional proportion (%) of total global population or emissions in 2018 or 
2019, for five categories: population (persons); consumption-based CO 2-FFI emissions (GtCO 2); production-based CO 2-FFI emissions (GtCO 2); production-based GHG emissions 
excluding CO 2-LULUCF (GtCO 2-eq); and production-based GHG emissions including CO 2-LULUCF (GtCO 2-eq). Panel (b) shows the regional proportion (%) of total cumulative 
production-based CO 2 emissions from 1850 to 2019, including and excluding CO 2-LULUCF (GtCO 2). In the lower panels, the proportion of each population or emissions 
category attributable to Least-Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are shown, where available (CO 2-LULUCF data is not available for these regions). 
GHG emissions are converted into CO 2-equivalents based on global warming potentials with a 100-year time horizon (GWP100) from the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report 
(Forster et al. 2021a). Source: data from Friedglinstein et al. (2020).
A growing number of countries have reduced CO 2 and GHG emissions 
for longer than 10 years (high confidence) (Le Quéré et  al. 2019; 
Burck et al. 2021; Lamb et al. 2021a; Wu et al. 2021). Data up to 2018 
indicates that about 24 countries have reduced territorial CO 2 and GHG 
emissions (excluding LULUCF CO 2), as well as consumption-based CO 2 
emissions, for at least 10 years (Lamb et al. 2021a). Uncertainties in 
emissions levels and changes over time prevents a precise assessment 
of reductions in some cases. Of these 24  countries, 12 peaked 
emissions in the 2000s; six have sustained longer reductions since 
the 1970s; and six are former members of the Eastern Bloc, where 
emissions dropped rapidly in the 1990s and continued declining 
at a  slower pace thereafter. Country emissions reductions have 
been driven by both climate and non-climate policies and factors, 
including structural changes. To date, most territorial emissions 
reductions were realised in the electricity and heat sector, followed 
by industry and buildings, while in many cases transport emissions 
have increased since countries reached their overall emissions peak 
(Climate Transparency 2021; Lamb et al. 2021a). One estimate of the 
total reduction in annual GHG emissions – from peak years to 2018 – 
sums to 3.2 GtCO 2-eq across all decarbonising countries (Lamb et al. 
2021a). These reductions have therefore been far outweighed by 
recent emissions growth. However, climate policy related reductions 
may be even larger when compared against a counterfactual case of 
emissions growth across different sectors (Eskander and Fankhauser 
2020) (Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1; Section 2.8).
The recent (2010–2019) emissions changes of some countries are 
in line with pathways that limit warming to below 2°C (<67%) 
(e.g., –4% average annual reductions) (Figure 2.10). Overall, there are 
first country cases emerging that highlight the feasibility of sustained 
emission reductions outside of periods of economic disruption 
(Lamb et al. 2021a). However, such pathways will need to be taken by many more countries to keep the goals of the Paris Agreement 
in reach (Höhne et  al. 2020; Roelfsema et  al. 2020; Kriegler et  al. 
2018a; den Elzen et al. 2019) as analysed by Chapter 4 of this report. 
Moreover, observed reductions are not yet consistent and long-term, 
nor achieved across all sectors, nor fully aligned with country NDC 
targets (Le Quéré et al. 2019; Lamb et al. 2021a; den Elzen et al. 2019; 
Burck et al. 2021; Climate Transparency 2021).
2.2.4 Sectoral GHG Emissions Trends
In 2019, 34% (20 GtCO 2-eq) of the 59 GtCO 2-eq GHG emissions 
came from the energy sector, 24% (14 GtCO 2-eq) from industry, 
22% (13 GtCO 2-eq) from AFOLU, 15% (8.7 GtCO 2-eq) from transport 
and 6% (3.3 GtCO 2-eq) from buildings (Figure 2.12). The relative size 
of each sector depends on the exact definition of sector boundaries 
(de la Rue du Can et  al. 2015; Lamb et  al. 2021b). The largest 
individual subsector contributing to global GHG emissions in 2019 
was electricity and heat generation at 14 GtCO 2-eq. This subsector 
can be reallocated to consuming sectors as indirect (scope  2) 
emissions to emphasise the role of final energy demand and demand-
side solutions in climate change mitigation (Creutzig et  al. 2018) 
(Chapter 5). This increases the emission share of the industry sector 
to 34% and of the buildings sector to 16%.
Average annual GHG emissions growth has been fastest in the 
transport sector with about 1.8% for the most recent period 
2010–2019, followed by direct emissions in the industry sector (1.4%) 
and the energy sector (1%) (Figure 2.13). This is different to growth 
patterns observed in the previous decade as reported in AR5 (IPCC 
2014a; Blanco et  al. 2014). Between 2000 and 2009 fastest GHG 
emissions growth was observed for industry with 3.4% followed by

the energy sector with 2.3%. GHG emissions growth in the transport 
sector has been stable across both periods at about 1.8%, while direct 
building emissions growth averaged below 1% during 2010–2019. 
Ranking of high-emitting subsectors by direct emissions highlights 
the importance of CO 2 emissions from LULUCF (6.6 GtCO 2-eq; but 
with low confidence in magnitude and trend), road transport (6.1 
GtCO 2-eq), metals (3.1 GtCO 2-eq), and other industry (4.4 GtCO 2-eq). 
Overall, some of the fastest growing sources of subsector emissions 
from 2010 to 2019 have been international aviation (+3.4%),10 
domestic aviation (+3.3%), inland shipping (+2.9%), metals (+2.3%), 
international shipping (+1.7%), and road transport (+1.7%).

2.3 Past and Present Trends of Consumption-
based CO 2 Emissions (CBEs) and 
Emissions Embodied in Trade
2.3.1 Scope, Variability and Uncertainty of CBEs
Consumption is increasingly met by global supply chains often 
involving large geographical distances and causing emissions in 
producing countries (Hubacek et  al. 2014, 2016; Wiedmann and 
Lenzen 2018). Therefore, accounting for emissions from production 
along the entire supply chain to fulfil final demand,  – so-called 
consumption-based emissions (CBEs), – is necessary to understand 
why emissions occur and to what extent consumption choices and 
associated supply chains contribute to total emissions, and ultimately 
how to influence consumption to achieve climate mitigation targets 
and environmental justice (Vasconcellos 2020).
Production-based emissions (PBEs) and territorial emissions 
resulting from the production and consumption of goods and 
services within a  region (for both domestic use and export) are 
often used by authorities to report carbon emissions (Peters 2008) 
(Section  2.2). PBEs also include emissions from international 
activities (e.g.,  international aviation/shipping and non-resident 
activities), which are excluded from territorial emissions (Karstensen 
et al. 2018; Shan et al. 2018). In contrast, CBEs refer to emissions 
along the entire supply chains induced by consumption, irrespective 
of the place of production (Liu et al. 2015b). This reflects a shared 
understanding that a wider system boundary going beyond territorial 
emissions is important to avoid outsourcing of pollution and to 
achieve global decarbonisation. CBEs allow for the identification of 
new policy levers through information on a country’s trade balance 
of embodied emissions, households’ carbon implications of their 
lifestyle choices, companies’ upstream emissions as input for supply chain management, and cities’ footprints outside their administrative 
boundaries (Davis and Caldeira 2010; Feng et al. 2013). Kander et al. 
(2015) proposed a technology-adjusted consumption-based emission 
accounting (TCBA) approach to address the issue of carbon intensity 
in exports. TCBA incorporates emissions embodied in trade but also 
adjusted for differences in carbon efficiency in exports of different 
countries. Unlike PBEs, there are no internationally agreed approaches 
to calculate CBEs, making it a major drawback for mainstreaming the 
use of this indicator in policymaking.
There are other proposed emission accounting approaches used 
in different circumstances. Historical cumulative emissions (HCEs) 
are used when analysing countries’ historic contribution to 
emissions and responsibility for emission reduction. HCEs account 
for a  country’s cumulative past emissions, which may be different 
from the country’s  current annual emissions (Botzen et  al. 2008; 
Ritchie 2019), but are sensitive to the choice of cut-off period. For 
example, the USA and EU-27 countries plus the UK contributed 
respectively 13.3% and 8.7% to global PBEs in 2019 (Crippa et al. 
2020), however, they emitted around 25% and 22% of global 
historical PBEs since 1751 (Ritchie 2019). Extraction-based emissions 
(EBEs) accounting allocates all emissions from burning fossil fuels 
throughout the supply chains to the country where the fuels were 
extracted (Steininger and Schinko 2015). EBEs can be calculated 
by multiplying primary energy extraction of fossil fuels with their 
respective carbon content (Erickson and Lazarus 2013). Another 
approach for accounting emissions is income-based emission (IBE), 
which traces emissions throughout all supply chains and allocates 
emissions to primary inputs (e.g., capital and labour). In other words, 
IBEs investigate a  country’s direct and indirect downstream GHG 
emissions enabled by its primary inputs (Liang et al. 2017a). All these 
approaches provide complementary information and different angles 
to assigning responsibility for emissions reductions.
Box 2.1 | Policy Applications of Consumption-based Emissions
Consumption-based emissions provide additional or complementary information to production-based emissions that can be used for 
a variety of policy applications. These include:
• Complementary national-level emissions accounting and target or budget setting
• Raising awareness and increasing understanding of the GHG effects of consumption
• Accounting for and understanding of distributional and responsibility issues in GHG emissions mitigation, both nationally 
and internationally
• Incentives to change consumption patterns or reduce consumption (e.g., through taxation policies)
• Accounting for and understanding of carbon leakage and emissions embodied in trade*
• International emissions trading schemes or linked national schemes
• Trade policies addressing emissions embodied in trade and international supply chains (e.g., border tax adjustments and clean 
technology transfers, carbon offsetting or financing, etc.)
• Including embodied emissions in product performance standards and labelling
• Policies of public and private procurement
• Agreements with international suppliers
• Discussing the climate impacts of lifestyles and inequalities in consumption and associated emissions.
The dominant method for calculating nations’ CBEs is global multi-
region input-output (GMRIO) analysis (Wiedmann and Lenzen 
2018). Other frequently used approaches include analysing bilateral 
trade flows of products and their lifecycle emission factors (Sato 
2014). Generally, the uncertainties associated with CBEs depends 
on the choice of the dataset/model used for calculation, which 
differs according to: (i) the national economic and trade data 
used; (ii) the emissions data used; (iii) the sector or product-level 
aggregation; (iv) the regional aggregation; (v) the conceptual scope 
(e.g., residential vs territorial accounting principle); and (vi) the model 
construction techniques, which include table-balancing algorithms 
and ways of dealing with missing or conflicting data (Moran and 
Wood 2014; Owen, 2017; Wieland et  al. 2018; Wood et  al. 2018, 
2019). When excluding systematic error sources, research has shown 
that the stochastic relative standard deviation (RSD) of total national 
CBEs is not significantly different to that from PBEs accounts and in 
the region of 5–15% (Wood et al. 2018, 2019).
Six global accounts for consumption-based GHG emissions at the 
country level are widely used (Table  2.2). Each dataset has been 
constructed by different teams of researchers, covering different time 
periods and containing CBEs estimates for different sets of countries 
and regions (Owen 2017).
Wood et al. (2019) present a comprehensive and systematic model 
intercomparison and find a  variation of 5–10% for both PBE and 
CBE accounts of major economies and country groups (e.g., EU-28, 
OECD). The estimates for the USA were the most closely aligned, 
with 3.7% RSD. For smaller countries, variability is in the order 
of 20–30% and can reach more than 40% in cases of very small, 
highly trade-exposed countries such as Singapore and Luxembourg (Wood  et  al.  2019). It  is recommended that CBEs results for such 
countries be interpreted with care.
Overall, production accounts showed a slightly higher convergence 
(8% average of RSD) than consumption-based accounts (12%). 
The variation across model results can be approximately halved, 
when normalising national totals to one common value for 
a  selected base year. The difference between PBEs result variation 
(4% average RSD after normalisation) and CBEs results (7%) remains 
after normalisation.
In general, the largest contributors to uncertainty of CBEs results 
are – in descending order of priority – the total of territorial GHG 
emission accounts, the allocation of emissions to economic sectors, 
the total and composition of final demand, and lastly the structure 
of the economy. Harmonising territorial emissions across GMRIO 
datasets is the single most important factor that reduces uncertainty 
by about 50% (Tukker et al. 2020). More work is required to optimise 
or even institutionalise the compilation of multi-region input-output 
data and models to enhance the accuracy of consumption-based 
accounting (Tukker et al. 2018; Wood et al. 2018).
2.3.2 Trends in Global and Regional CBEs Trajectories
In comparison to territorial emissions discussed in Section  2.2, 
Figure 2.14 shows the trends of global and regional CBEs from 1990 
to 2018. This section uses the PBEs and CBEs data from the Global 
Carbon Budget 2020 (Friedlingstein et al. 2020), which are slightly 
different from the PBEs used in Section 2.2. The Global Carbon Budget 
only includes CO 2 emissions from fossil fuels and cement production.Box 2.1 (continued)
The points above are based on a synopsis of studies (Steininger et al. 2014; Afionis et al. 2017; Hubacek et al. 2017b; Wang and Zhou 
2018; Bolea et al. 2020).
* Note, however, that comparing embodied emissions in trade between countries is further complicated by the fact that emission intensities differ 
across countries. Approaches to adjust for these differences and facilitate comparisons have been suggested (Kander et al. 2015; Baumert et al. 2019; 
Dietzenbacher et al. 2020; Jakob 2021). Many different approaches on how to share responsibility between producers and consumers have been 
proposed in designing effective integrated global climate policies (Liu and Fan 2017; Khajehpour et al. 2019; Jakob et al. 2021). Ultimately, assigning 
responsibility is normative.

Figure 2.14 | Consumption-based CO 2 emissions trends for the period 1990–2018.  The CBEs of countries are collected from the Global Carbon Budget 2020 
(Friedlingstein et al. 2020). Source: this figure is modified based on Hubacek et al. (2021).
The two panels at left in Figure  2.14 show total and per  capita 
CBEs for six regions. The three panels on the right show additional 
information for the 18 top-emitting countries with the highest 
CBEs in 2018. In  Developed Countries, consumption-based CO 2 
emissions peaked at 15 GtCO 2 in 2007 with a  subsequent 16% 
decline until 2016 (to 12.7  GtCO 2) and a  slight rebound of 1.6% 
until 2018 (to 12.9  GtCO 2). Asia and Pacific has been a  major 
contributor to consumption-based CO 2 emissions growth since 2000 
and exceeded Developed Countries as the global largest emissions 
source in 2015. From 1990 to 2018, the average growth rate of Asia 
and Pacific was  4.8% per  year, while in other regions emissions 
declined by –1.1%–4.3% per  year on average. In 2018, 35% of 
global consumption-based CO 2 emissions were from Developed 
Countries and 39% from Asia and Pacific, 5% from Latin American 
and Caribbean, 5% from Eastern Europe and West Central Asia, 5% 
from Middle East, and 3% from Africa (Hubacek et al. 2021). Global 
CBEs kept growing over the period with a short-lived decline in 2008 
due to the global financial crisis. In 2020, lockdowns associated with 
COVID-19 significantly reduced global emissions (Section  2.2.2), 
including CBEs (Shan et al. 2021a).2.3.3 Decoupling of Emissions from Economic Growth
There has been a long-standing discussion on whether environmental 
impacts such as carbon emissions and use of natural resources can 
be decoupled from economic growth. It is controversial whether 
absolute decoupling can be achieved at a  global scale (Ward et 
al. 2016; Hickel and Kallis 2020; Haberl et al. 2020). However, 
a number of studies found that it is feasible to achieve decoupling 
at the national level, and they have explored the reasons for such 
decoupling (Schandl et  al. 2016; Ward et  al. 2016; Deutch 2017; 
Roinioti and Koroneos 2017; Vadén et al. 2020; Habimana Simbi et al. 
2021; Shan et al. 2021b).
Table  2.3 shows the extent of decoupling of CBEs and GDP 
of countries based on CBEs from the Global Carbon Budget 
(Friedlingstein et  al. 2020) and GDP data from the World Bank. 
Table 2.4 also presents countries’ degree of decoupling of PBEs and 
GDP . These data allow a comparison of decoupling between GDP 
and both PBEs and CBEs.

Note: CBEs are obtained from the Global Carbon Budget 2020 (Friedlingstein et al. 2020), GDP and population are from the World Bank. One country (Venezuela) does not have 
GDP data after 2015, so the degree of decoupling was only calculated for 115 countries. This table is modified from Hubacek et al. (2021).
Absolute decoupling refers to a decline of emissions in absolute terms 
or as being stable while GDP grows (i.e., a decoupling index11 greater 
than 1); relative decoupling refers to growth of emissions being lower 
than growth of GDP (a decoupling index between 0 and 1); and no 
decoupling, which refers to a situation where emissions grow to the 
same extent or faster than GDP (a decoupling index of less than 0) 
(Wu et al. 2018).
During the most recent three-year period from 2015 to 2018, 23  countries 
(or 20% of the 116 sample countries) have achieved absolute 
decoupling of CBEs and GDP , while 32 countries (or 28%) achieved 
absolute decoupling of PBEs and GDP: 14 of them (e.g., the UK, Japan, 

DI refers to decoupling index; G 1 refers to the GDP of reporting year while G 0 refers to the base year; E 1 refers to emissions of the reporting year while E 0 refers to emissions 
of the base year.and the Netherlands) also decoupled PBEs and GDP . Countries with 
absolute decoupling of CBEs tend to achieve decoupling at relatively 
high levels of economic development and high per capita emissions. 
Most of EU and North American countries are in this group. Decoupling 
was not only achieved by outsourcing carbon-intensive production, but 
also improvements in production efficiency and energy mix, leading 
to a  decline of emissions. Structural Decomposition Analysis shows 
that the main driver for decoupling has been a  reduction in carbon 
intensity (i.e., change in energy mix and energy efficiency) from both 
domestic production and imports (Hubacek et  al. 2021). Similarly, 
Wood et al. (2020b) found that EU countries have reduced their overall 
consumption-based GHG emissions by 8% between 1995 and 2016,

Note: CBEs are obtained from the Global Carbon Budget 2020 (Friedlingstein et al. 2020), GDP and population are from the World Bank. One country (Venezuela) does not 
have GDP data after 2015, so the degree of decoupling was only calculated for 115 countries. In order to be consistent with the results of CBEs, we calculate the decoupling 
of PBE until 2018.
mainly due to the use of more efficient technology. The literature also 
shows that changes in the structure of economy with a shift to tertiary 
sectors of production may contribute to such decoupling (Kanitkar et 
al. 2015; Jiang et al. 2021).
A total of 67 (or 58%) countries, including China and India, have 
relatively decoupled GDP and CBEs between 2015 and 2018, 
reflecting a slower growth in emissions than GDP . It is worth noting 
that the USA shows relative decoupling of emissions (both CBEs and 
PBEs) and GDP over the most recent period, although it strongly 
decoupled economic growth from emissions between 2005 and 
2015. Thus decoupling can be temporary and countries’ emissions 
may again increase after a period of decoupling.
Another 19 (or 16%) countries, such as South Africa and Nepal, 
have experienced no decoupling between GDP and CBEs from 2015 
to 2018, meaning the growth of their GDP is closely tied with the 
consumption of emission-intensive goods. As a  result, a  further 
increase of GDP in these countries will likely lead to higher emissions, 
if they follow the historical trend without substantive improvement 
in efficiency of production and energy use.
It is important to note that a country’s degree of decoupling changes 
over time. For example, 32 countries achieved absolute decoupling 
from 2010 to 2015 but only 10 of them remained decoupled over the 
next three years. More importantly, although absolute decoupling has 
reduced annual emissions, the remaining emissions are still contributing 
to an increase in atmospheric carbon concentration. Absolute decoupling is not sufficient to avoid consuming the remaining CO 2 
emission budget under the global warming limit of 1.5°C or 2°C and to 
avoid climate breakdown (Stoknes and Rockström 2018; Hickel and 
Kallis 2020). Even if all countries decouple in absolute terms this might 
still not be sufficient and thus can only serve as one of the indicators 
and steps toward fully decarbonising the economy and society.
2.3.4 Emissions Embodied in Trade (EET)
As global trade patterns have changed over recent decades, so have 
emissions embodied in trade (EET) (Jiang & Green 2017). EET refers 
to emissions associated with production of traded goods and services 
and is equal to the difference between PBEs and CBEs (Wiebe and 
Yamano 2016). EET includes two parts: emissions embodied in 
imports (EEI); and emissions embodied in exports (EEE). For a given 
country or region with CBEs higher than PBEs, it is a net importer 
with a higher EEI than EEE, and vice versa.
EET have been rising faster since the 1980s due to an increase in 
trade volume (Xu and Dietzenbacher 2014; Wood et al. 2018). CO 2 
emissions from the production of internationally traded products 
peaked in 2006 at about 26% of global CO 2 emissions. Since then, 
international CO 2 emissions transfers declined but are likely to 
remain an important part of the climate policy agenda (Wood et al. 
2020a). About 24% of global economic output and 25% of global 
CO2 emissions are embodied in the international trade of goods and 
services as of 2014 (Hubacek et al. 2021).

consumption-based emission estimates that are higher than traditional territorial emission estimates. Blue shading indicates the reverse. Production-based emissions are 
collected from EDGAR and consumption-based emissions from the Global Carbon Budget 2020 (Friedlingstein et al. 2020). Source: this figure is modified based on Hubacek 
et al. (2021).
2.3.4.1 Net Emission Transfers
Located downstream in global supply chains, developed countries 
(mostly in Western Europe and North America) tend to be net 
emission importers, that is, EEI are larger than EEE. For example, over 
40% of national CO 2 footprints in France, Germany, Italy, and Spain 
are from imports (Fan et al. 2017). Developing countries tend to be 
net emission exporters with higher PBEs than their CBEs (Peters et al. 
2011a), especially for Asia and Pacific (as shown in Figure 2.15). That 
is to say, there is a net emission transfer and outsourcing of carbon-
intensive production from developed to developing economies via 
global trade (Jiang et al. 2018), mainly caused by cheap labour costs 
(Tate and Bals 2017) and cheap raw materials (Mukherjee 2018). 
Increasing openness to trade (Fernández-Amador et  al. 2016) and 
less stringent environmental legislation (acting as so-called pollution 
havens) are also possible reasons (Hoekstra et al. 2016; Malik and 
Lan 2016; Banerjee and Murshed 2020).
Net emissions transferred between developing and developed 
countries peaked at 7.3% of global CO 2 emissions in 2006 and then 
subsequently declined (Wood et  al. 2020a). The main reason for 
the decline was an improvement in the carbon intensity of traded 
products, rather than a decline in trade volume (Wood et al. 2020a). 
Despite continued improvements, developing economies tend to 
have higher emission intensity than developed economies due to 
less efficient technologies and a carbon-intensive fuel mix (Jiang and 
Guan 2017).
2.3.4.2 Geographical Shifts of Emissions Embodied in Trade
With the rapid growth of developing countries, the geographical 
centre of global trade as well as emissions embodies in trade is 
changing. The fast growth of Asian countries is shifting the global 
trade centre from Europe to Asia (Zhang et al. 2019). Asian exports in 
monetary units increased by 235% from 1996 to 2011, and its share 
in global exports increased from 25% to 46%, whereas Europe’s 
share in global exports decreased from 51% in 1996 to 39% in 2011. 
After 2011, global trade has stalled, but Asia’s share of global exports 
further increased to 42% in 2020 (UNCTAD 2021).
In addition to changes in trade volume, trading patterns have also 
been changing significantly in Asian countries. These countries are 
replacing traditional trading hubs (such as Russia and Germany) due 
to the fast growth in trade flows, especially with countries of the 
Global South (Zhang et al. 2019). The largest geographical shifts in 
trade-embodied emissions between 1995 and 2011 occurred in high-
tech, electronics, and machinery (Malik and Lan 2016; Jiang et  al. 
2018). For example, China is shifting its exports to include more 
low-carbon and higher value-added goods and services. As a result, 
China’s exported emissions declined by 20% from 2008 to 2015 
(Mi et al. 2018).
Developing countries are increasingly playing an important role 
in global trade. EET between developing countries, so-called 
South-South trade, has more than doubled between 2004 (0.47 Gt) 
and 2011 (1.11 Gt), which is seen as a reflection of a new phase of globalisation (Meng et al. 2018). Developing countries, therefore, 
have gained importance as global suppliers of goods and services and 
have also become more relevant as global consumers as they grow 
their domestic demand (Fernández-Amador et al. 2016). Since 2014, 
CO2 emission transfer between developing countries has plateaued 
and then slightly declined and seems to have stabilised at around the 
same level of transfers between non-OECD and OECD countries at 
around 2.4 GtCO 2 yr –1 (Wood et al. 2020a). In both cases, a decrease 
in carbon intensity of trade just about offset increased trade volumes 
(Wood et al. 2020a).
2.4 Economic Drivers and Their Trends 
by Regions and Sectors
This section provides a  summary of the main economic drivers of 
GHG emissions (mostly territorial) by regions and sectors, including 
those that are more indirect drivers related to economic activity, such 
as inequality and rapid urbanisation. Trade as a driver of global GHG 
emissions is described in the Chapter  2 Supplementary Material. 
Socio-demographic drivers are described in Section  2.6. The Kaya 
decomposition presented in this section is based on the International 
Energy Agency (IEA) and Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric 
Research (EDGAR) v6 databases and tracks global, regional, and 
sectoral GHG emissions from 1990 to 2019 (Crippa et  al. 2021; 
IEA 2021c; Lamb et  al. 2021b; Minx et  al. 2021). It shows main 
contributors to GHG emissions as independent factors, although 
these factors also interact with each other.
2.4.1 Economic Drivers at Global and Regional Levels
Economic growth (measured as GDP) and its main components  – 
GDP per  capita and population growth  – remained the strongest 
drivers of GHG emissions in the last decade, following a long-term 
trend (robust evidence, high agreement) (Liddle 2015; Malik et al. 
2016; Sanchez and Stern 2016; Chang et al. 2019; Dong et al. 2019; 
Liobikiene and Butkus 2019; Liu et al. 2019a; Mardani et al. 2019; Pan 
et al. 2019; Dong et al. 2020; Parker and Bhatti 2020; Xia et al. 2021). 
Globally, GDP per  capita remained by far the strongest upward 
driver, increasing almost in tandem with energy consumption and 
CO2 emissions up until 2015, after which some modest decoupling 
occurred (Deutch 2017; Wood et al. 2018) (Section 2.3.3). The main 
counteracting, yet insufficient, factor that led to emissions reductions 
was decreased energy use per  unit of GDP in almost all regions 
(–2.0% yr –1 between 2010 and 2019 globally) (see also Lamb et al. 
2021b) (Figure  2.16) (robust evidence, high agreement). These 
reductions in energy intensity are a result of technological innovation, 
structural changes, regulation, fiscal support, and direct investment, 
as well as increased economic efficiency in underlying sectors (Yao 
et al. 2015; Sanchez and Stern 2016; Chang et al. 2019; Dong et al. 
2019a; Mohmmed et al. 2019; Stern 2019; Azhgaliyeva et al. 2020; 
Goldemberg 2020; Gao et al. 2021; Liddle and Huntington 2021; Liu 
et al. 2019b; Xia et al. 2021).
The decades-long trend that efficiency gains were outpaced by 
an increase in worldwide GDP (or income) per  capita continued 
unabated in the last 10 years (robust evidence, high agreement) 
(Wiedmann et al. 2020; Xia et al. 2021). In addition, the emissions-
reducing effects of energy efficiency improvements are diminished 
by the energy rebound effect, which has been found in several 
studies to largely offset any energy savings (robust evidence, high 
agreement) (Rausch and Schwerin 2018; Colmenares et  al. 2020; 
Stern 2020; Brockway et al. 2021; Bruns et al. 2021). The rebound 
effect is discussed extensively in Section 9.9.2.A significant decarbonisation of the energy system was only 
noticeable in North America, Europe and Eurasia. Globally, the 
amount of CO 2 per  unit of energy used has practically remained 
unchanged over the last three decades (Tavakoli 2018; Chang et al. 
2019), although it is expected to decrease more consistently in 
the future (Xia et al. 2021). Population growth has also remained 
a  strong and persistent upward driver in almost all regions 
(+1.2%  yr –1 globally from 2010 to 2019) (Lamb et  al. 2021) 
(Figure 2.16), although per capita emission levels are very uneven 
across world regions. Therefore, modest population increases in

GHG emissions by world region in 2019; and (c) Kaya decomposition of CO 2 emissions drivers. The Kaya decomposition is based on the equation F = P(G/P)
(E/G)(F/E), where F is CO 2 emissions, P is population, G/P is GDP per capita, E/G is the energy intensity of GDP and F/E is the carbon intensity of energy. The indicated annual 
growth rates are averaged across the years 2010–2019 (in panel (c), these are for fossil fuel CO 2 emissions only, in order to ensure compatibility with underlying energy data). 
Note that the energy consumption by itself (primary energy supply) is not part of the decomposition, but is listed here for comparison with the Kaya factors. Source: data from 
Crippa et al. (2021), IEA (2021c), Minx et al. (2021).
wealthy countries may have a similar impact on emissions as high 
population increases in regions with low per capita emission levels.
Developing countries remained major accelerators of global 
CO2 emissions growth since 2010, mostly driven by increased 
consumption and production, in particular in East Asia (robust 
evidence, high agreement) (Jiborn et al. 2020). While energy intensity 
declined to a  similar extent in countries of the Organisation for 
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and non-OECD 
countries over the last 30 years, economic growth has been much 
stronger in non-OECD countries (González-Torres et al. 2021). This led 
to an average annual growth rate of 2.8% of CO 2 emissions in these 
countries, whereas they decreased by 0.3% yr –1 in OECD countries 
(UNEP 2019). The majority of developed economies reduced both 
production-based and consumption-based CO 2 emissions modestly 
(Jiborn et al. 2020; Xia et al. 2021). This was due to slower economic 
growth, increased energy efficiency (less energy per unit of GDP), fuel 
switching from coal to gas (mostly in North America) (Wang et al. 
2020b), and the use of less and cleaner energy from renewables in 
Europe (Peters et al. 2017; Karstensen et al. 2018; Chang et al. 2019; 
Wood et al. 2019c).
Economic growth as the main driver of GHG emissions is particularly 
strong in China and India (robust evidence, high agreement) (Liu et al. 
2019b; Ortega-Ruiz et al. 2020; Z. Wang et al. 2020b; Yang et al. 2020; 
Zheng et  al. 2020; Xia et  al. 2021), although both countries show 
signs of relative decoupling because of structural changes (Marin 
and Mazzanti 2019). A change in China’s production structure (with 
relatively less heavy industry and lower-carbon manufacturing) and 
consumption patterns (i.e., the type of goods and services consumed) 
has become the main moderating factor of emissions after 2010, 
while economic growth, consumption levels, and investment remain 
the dominating factors driving up emissions (Wang and Jiang 2019; 
Jiborn et  al. 2020; Zheng et  al. 2020). In India, an expansion of 
production and trade as well as a higher energy intensity between 

Wang and Zhou 2020; Z. Wang et al. 2020b).
2.4.2 Sectoral Drivers
GHG emissions continued to rise since 2010 across all sectors 
and subsectors, most rapidly in electricity production, industry, 
and transport. Decarbonisation gains from improvements in energy 
efficiency across different sectors and worldwide have been largely 
wiped out by increases in demand for goods and services. Prevailing 
consumption patterns have also tended to aggravate energy use 
and emissions, with the long-term trend led by developed regions. 
Decarbonisation trends in some developed regions are limited in 
size and geographically. Globally, there are enormous unexploited 
mitigation potentials from adopting best available technologies.
The following subsections discuss main emissions drivers by sector. 
More detailed analyses of sectoral emissions and mitigation options 
are presented in Chapters 6–11.2.4.2.1 Energy Systems
Global energy system emissions growth has slowed down in recent 
years, but global oil and gas use was still growing (Jackson et  al. 
2019) and the sector remained the single largest contributor to global 
GHG emissions in 2019 with 20 GtCO 2-eq (34%) (high confidence) 
(Figure  2.17). Most of the 14 GtCO 2-eq from electricity and heat 
generation (23% of global GHG emissions in 2019) were due to 
energy use in industry and in buildings, making these two sectors 
also prominent targets for mitigation (Davis et al. 2018; Crippa et al. 
2019) (see subsections 2.4.2.2 and 2.4.2.3 below).
Growth in CO 2 emissions from energy systems has closely tracked 
rising GDP per  capita globally (Lamb et  al. 2021b), affirming the 
substantial literature describing the mutual relationship between 
economic growth and demand for energy and electricity (robust 
evidence, high agreement) (Khanna and Rao 2009; Stern, 2011). 
This relationship has played out strongly in developing regions, 
particularly in Asia, where a massive scale up of energy supply has 
accompanied economic growth – with average annual increases of 
energy demand between 3.8–4.3% in 2010–2019 (Figure 2.17). The 
key driver for slowing the growth of energy systems CO 2 emissions 
has been declining energy intensities in almost all regions. Annually, 
1.9% less energy per unit of GDP was used globally between 2010 
and 2019.
The carbon intensity of power generation varies widely between 
(and also within) regions (Chapter  6). In North America, a  switch 
from coal to gas for power generation (Peters et al. 2017, 2020; Feng 
2019; Mohlin et al. 2019) as well as an overall decline in the share 
of fossil fuels in electricity production (from 66% in 2010 to 59% in 
2018) (Mohlin et al. 2019) has decreased carbon intensity and CO 2 
emissions. Since 2007, Europe’s carbon intensity improvements have 
been driven by the steady expansion of renewables in the share of 
electricity generation (medium evidence, high agreement) (Peters 
et al. 2017, 2020; Le Quéré et al. 2019; Rodrigues et al. 2020). Some 
studies attribute these effects to climate policies, such as the carbon 
floor price in the UK, the EU emissions trading scheme, and generous 
renewable energy subsidies across the continent (Dyrstad et  al. 
2019; H. Wang et  al. 2020). South-East Asian developed countries 
and Australia, Japan and New Zealand stand out in contrast to other 
developed regions, with an increase of regional carbon intensity of 
1.8 and 1.9% yr –1, respectively (Figure 2.17). Generally, the use of 
natural gas for electricity production is growing strongly in most 
countries and gas has contributed to the largest increase in global 
fossil CO 2 emissions in recent years (Jackson et  al. 2019; Peters 
et al. 2020). Furthermore, gas brings the risk of increased methane 
(CH 4) emissions from fugitive sources, as well as large cumulative 
emissions over the lifetime of new gas power plants that may erase 
early carbon intensity reductions (Shearer et al. 2020).
The growth of emissions from coal power slowed after 2010, and 
even declined between 2011 and 2019, primarily due to a slowdown 
of economic growth and fewer coal capacity additions in China 
(Friedlingstein et al. 2019; Peters et al. 2020). Discussions of a global 
‘peak coal’, however, may be premature, as further growth was 
observed in 2019 (Friedlingstein et al. 2019; Peters et al. 2020). Large 
ongoing and planned capacity increases in India, Turkey, Indonesia, 
Vietnam, South Africa, and other countries has become a driver of 
thermal coal use after 2014 (UNEP 2017; Edenhofer et  al. 2018; 
Steckel et al. 2019).
2.4.2.2 Industry Sector
When indirect emissions from electricity and heat production are 
included, industry becomes the single highest emitting sector of 
GHGs (20.0 GtCO 2-eq in 2019) (high confidence). Facilitated by 
globalisation, East Asia has been the main source and primary driver 
of global industry emissions growth since 2000 (robust evidence, 
high agreement) (Lamb et  al. 2021). However, while East Asia 
has emitted 45% of the world’s industry GHG emissions in 2019, 
a remarkable decrease of 5.0% yr –1 in energy intensity and 1.6% in carbon intensity helped to stabilise direct industrial CO 2 emissions in 
this region (–0.3% yr –1 between 2010 and 2019; Figure 2.18). Direct 
industry CO 2 emissions have also declined in Latin America, Europe 
and Australia, Japan and New Zealand, and – to a smaller extent – 
in North America. In all other regions, they were growing  – most 
rapidly in southern Asia (+4.3% annually for direct CO 2 emissions 
since 2010) (Figure 2.18).
The main global driver of industry emissions has been a massive rise 
in the demand for products that are indirectly used in production, 
such as cement, chemicals, steel, aluminium, wood, paper, plastics, 
lubricants, fertilisers, and so on. This demand was driven by economic 
growth, rising affluence, and consumption, as well as a  rapid rise 
in urban populations and associated infrastructure development 
(robust evidence, high agreement) (Krausmann et al. 2018). There is 010

strong evidence that the growing use of concrete, steel, and other 
construction materials is particularly tightly coupled to these drivers 
(Pauliuk et al. 2013; Cao et al. 2017; Krausmann et al. 2017; Plank 
et al. 2018; Haberl et al. 2020). Per capita stocks of cement and steel 
show a typical pattern of rapid take-off as countries urbanise and 
industrialise, before slowing down to low growth at high levels of 
GDP . Hence, in countries that have recently been industrialising and 
urbanising  – that is Eastern, Southern and South-Eastern Asia  – 
a particularly strong increase of emissions from these subsectors can 
be observed. Selected wealthy countries seem to stabilise at high 
per capita levels of stocks, although it is unclear if these stabilisations 
persist and if they result in significant absolute reductions of material 
use (Wiedenhofer et  al. 2015; Cao et  al. 2017; Krausmann et  al. 
2018). Opportunities for prolonging lifetimes and improving end of life recycling in order to achieve absolute reductions in extraction 
activities are as yet unexploited (Krausmann et al. 2017; Zink and 
Geyer, 2017).
On the production side, improvements in the efficiency of material 
extraction, processing, and manufacturing have reduced industrial 
energy use per unit of output (J. Wang et al. 2019). These measures, 
alongside improved material substitution, lightweight designs, 
extended product and servicing lifetimes, improved service efficiency, 
and increased reuse and recycling will enable substantial emissions 
reductions in the future (Hertwich et al. 2019). In absence of these 
improvements in energy intensity, the growth of population and 
GDP per  capita would have driven the industrial CO 2 emissions 
to rise by more than 100% by 2017 compared with 1990, instead Chemicals

of 56% (Lamb et al. 2021b). Nonetheless, many studies point to deep 
regional differences in efficiency levels and large globally unexploited 
potentials to improve industrial energy efficiency by adopting best 
available technologies and practices for metal, cement, and chemical 
production (Gutowski et  al. 2013; Schulze et  al. 2016; Hernandez 
et al. 2018; Talaei et al. 2018).
2.4.2.3 Buildings Sector
Global direct and indirect GHG emissions from the buildings sector 
reached 9.7 GtCO 2-eq in 2019, or 16% of global emissions). Most of 
these emissions (66%, or 6.4 GtCO 2-eq) were upstream emissions 
from power generation and commercial heat (Figure  2.19). The 
remaining 33% (3.3 GtCO 2-eq) of emissions were directly produced in buildings, for instance by gas and coal boilers, and cooking and 
lighting devices that burn kerosene, biomass, and other fuels (Lamb 
et al. 2021). Residential buildings accounted for the majority of this 
sector’s emissions (64%, 6.3 GtCO 2-eq, including both direct and 
indirect emissions), followed by non-residential buildings (35%, 
3.5 GtCO 2-eq) (high confidence).
Global buildings sector GHG emissions increased by 0.7% yr –1 
between 2010 and 2019 (Figure 2.19), growing the most in absolute 
terms in East and South Asia, whereas they declined the most in 
Europe, mostly due to the expansion of renewables in the energy 
sector and increased energy efficiency (Lamb et  al. 2021). North 
America has the highest per capita GHG emissions from buildings 
and the second highest absolute level after East Asia (Figure 2.19).

Figure  2.19 | Trends and drivers of global buildings sector emissions (see Figure  2.16 caption for details) with energy measured as total final 
energy consumption.
Rising wealth has been associated with more floor space being 
required to service growing demand in the retail, office, and hotel 
sectors (medium evidence, high agreement) (Daioglou et  al. 2012; 
Deetman et  al. 2020). In addition, demographic and social factors 
have driven a cross-national trend of increasing floor space per capita. 
As populations age and decrease in fertility, and as individuals seek 
greater privacy and autonomy, households declined in size, at least 
before the COVID-19 pandemic (Ellsworth-Krebs 2020). These factors 
led to increased floor space per capita, even as populations stabilise. 
This in turn is a  key driver for building sector emissions, because 
building characteristics such as size and type, rather than occupant 
behaviour, tend to explain the majority of energy use within dwellings 
(Guerra Santin et  al. 2009; Ürge-Vorsatz et  al. 2015; Huebner and 
Shipworth 2017) (Chapter 9).
Energy activity levels further drive regional differences. In Eurasia, 
Europe and North America, thermal demands for space heating 
dominate building energy use, at 66%, 62% and 48% of residential 
energy demand, respectively (IEA 2020a). In contrast, cooking has 
a much higher share of building energy use in regions of the Global 
South, including China (Cao et al. 2016). And, despite temperatures 
being on average warmer in the Global South, electricity use for 
cooling is a more prominent factor in the Global North (Waite et al. 
2017). This situation is changing, however, as rapid income growth 
and demographic changes in the Global South enable households to 
heat and cool their homes (Ürge-Vorsatz et al. 2015, 2020).
Steady improvements in building energy intensities across regions can 
be attributed to baseline improvements in building fabrics, appliance 
efficiencies, energy prices, and fuel shifts. Many countries have 
adopted a mix of relevant policies, such as energy labelling, building 
energy codes, and mandatory energy performance requirements 
(Nie and Kemp 2014; Nejat et  al. 2015; Economidou et  al. 2020). 
Efforts towards building refurbishments and retrofits have also 
been pursued in several nations, especially for historical buildings in 
Europe, but evidence suggests that the recent retrofit rates have not 
made a significant dent on emissions (Corrado and Ballarini 2016). 
The Chinese central government launched various policies, including 
command and control, economic incentives, and technology measures, 
but a big gap remains between the total rate of building green retrofit 
in the nation and the future retrofit potential (G. Liu et  al. 2020a, 
2020b). Still, one major global factor driving down energy intensities 
has been the global transition from inefficient coal and biomass use in 
buildings for heating and cooking, towards natural gas and electricity, 
in part led by concerted policy action in Asian countries (Ürge-Vorsatz 
et al. 2015; Kerimray et al. 2017; Thoday et al. 2018). As developing 
countries construct new buildings, there is sizable potential to reduce 
and use less carbon-intensive building materials and adopt building 
designs and standards that lower lifecycle buildings energy use and 
allow for passive comfort. Chapter 9 describes the mitigation options 
of the buildings sector.
2.4.2.4 Transport Sector
With a steady, average annual growth of +1.8% yr –1 between 2010 
and 2019, global transport GHG emissions reached 8.9  GtCO 2-eq 
in 2019 and accounted for 15% of all direct and indirect emissions (Figure  2.20). Road transport passenger and freight 
emissions represented by far the largest component and source of 
this growth (6.1 GtCO 2-eq, 69% of all transport emissions in 2019) 
(high confidence). National plus international shipping and aviation 
emissions together accounted for 2.0 GtCO 2-eq or 22% of the 
sector’s total in 2019. North America, Europe and Eastern Asia stand 
out as the main regional contributors to global transport emissions 
and together account for 50% of the sector’s total.
The proportion of total final energy used in transport (28%) and 
its fast expansion over time weighs heavily on climate mitigation 
efforts, as 92% of transport energy comes from oil-based fuels (IEA 
2020b). These trends situate transport as one of the most challenging 
sectors for climate change mitigation – no country has so far been 
able to realise significant emissions reductions in the sector. North 
America’s absolute and per  capita transport emissions are the 
highest amongst world regions, but those of South, South-East and 
East Asia are growing the fastest (high confidence) (between +4.6% 
and +5.2% yr –1 for CO 2 between 2010 and 2019) (Figure 2.20).
More so than any other sector, transport energy use has tracked GDP 
per capita growth (Figure 2.20), (Lamb et al. 2021). With the exception 
of road gasoline demand in OECD countries, the demand for all road 
fuels generally increases at least as fast as the rate at which GDP 
per  capita increases (Liddle and Huntington 2020). Developments 
since 1990 continue a historical trend of increasing travel distances 
and a shift from low- to high-speed transport modes that goes along 
with GDP growth (Schäfer et  al. 2009; Gota et  al. 2019). Modest 
improvements in energy efficiency have been realised between 2010 
and 2019, averaging –1.5% yr –1 in energy intensity globally, while 
carbon intensities of the transport sector have remained stable in all 
world regions (Figure  2.20). Overall, global increases in passenger 
and freight travel activity levels have outpaced energy efficiency and 
fuel economy improvements, continuing a  long-term trend for the 
transport sector (medium evidence, high agreement) (Gucwa and 
Schäfer 2013; Grübler 2015; McKinnon 2016).
Despite some policy achievements, energy use in the global transport 
system remains to the present deeply rooted in fossil fuels (robust 
evidence, high agreement) (Figueroa et al. 2014; IEA 2019). In part 
this is due to the increasing adoption of larger, heavier combustion-
based vehicles in some regions, which have tended to far outpace 
electric and hybrid vehicle sales (Chapter 10). Yet, stringent material 
efficiency and lightweight design of passenger vehicles alone would 
have the potential to cut cumulative global GHG emissions until 

While global passenger activity has expanded in all world regions, 
great disparities exist between low- and high-income regions, and 
within countries between urban and rural areas (ITF 2019). While 
private car use is dominant in OECD countries (EC 2019), the growth 
of passenger-km (the product of number of travellers and distance 
travelled) has considerably slowed there, down to an increase of 
just 1% yr –1 between 2000 and 2017 (SLoCaT 2018) (Chapter 10). 
Meanwhile, emerging economies in the Global South are becoming 
more car-dependent, with rapidly growing motorisation, on-demand 
private transport services, urban sprawl, and the emergence of local 
automotive production, while public transport struggles to provide 
adequate services (Dargay et  al. 2007; Hansen and Nielsen 2017; 
Pojani and Stead 2017).
Freight travel activity grew across the globe by 68% in the last 
two decades, driven by global GDP increases, together with the 
proliferation of online commerce and rapid (i.e.,  same-day and 
next-day) delivery (SLoCaT 2018). Growth has been particularly rapid 
in heavy-duty road freight transport.
While accounting for a small share of total GHG emissions, domestic 
and international aviation have been growing faster than road 
transport emissions, with average annual growth rates of +3.3% and 
+3.4%, respectively, between 2010 and 2019 (Crippa et  al. 2021; Minx et al. 2021;). Energy efficiency improvements in aviation were 
considerably larger than in road transport, but were outpaced by 
even larger increases in activity levels (SLoCaT 2018; Lee et al. 2021) 
(Chapter 10).
2.4.2.5 AFOLU Sector
GHG emissions from agriculture, forestry and other land use 
(AFOLU) reached 13 GtCO 2-eq globally in 2019 (medium confidence) 
(Figure 2.21). AFOLU trends, particularly those for CO 2-LULUCF , are 
subject to a high degree of uncertainty (Section 2.2.1). Overall, the 
AFOLU sector accounts for 22% of total global GHG emissions, and 
in several regions – Africa, Latin America, and South-East Asia – it 
is the single largest emitting sector, which is also significantly International aviation

affected itself by climate change (AR6 WGI Chapters 8, 11, and 12; 
and AR6 WGII Chapter 5). Latin America has the highest absolute and 
per capita AFOLU GHG emissions of any world region (Figure 2.21). 
CO2 emissions from land-use change and CH 4 emissions from 
enteric fermentation together account for 74% of sector-wide 
GHGs. Note that CO 2-LULUCF estimates included in this chapter are 
not necessarily comparable with country GHG inventories, due to 
different approaches to estimating anthropogenic CO 2 sinks (Grassi 
et al. 2018) (Chapter 7).Unlike all other sectors, AFOLU emissions are typically higher in 
developing compared to developed regions (medium confidence). 
In  Africa, Latin America, and South-East Asia, CO 2 emissions 
associated with land-use change and management predominate, 
dwarfing other AFOLU and non-AFOLU sources and making AFOLU 
the single largest sector with more than 50% of emissions in these 
regions (Lamb et  al. 2021b). Land-use and land-management 
emissions are associated with the expansion of agriculture into 
carbon-dense tropical forest areas (Vancutsem et  al. 2021), where 
large quantities of CO 2 emissions result from the removal and burning 
of biomass and draining of carbon rich soils (Pearson  et  al.  2017;

Figure 2.21 | Trends and drivers of global AFOLU sector emissions: (a) trends of GHG emissions by subsectors 1990–2019; (b) share of total sector and 
per capita GHG emissions by world region in 2019; and (c) Kaya decomposition of GHG emissions drivers.  Based on the equation H=P(A/P)(L/A)(H/L), where 
P is population, A/P is agricultural output per capita, L/A is the land required per unit of agricultural output (land efficiency), and H/L is GHG emissions per unit of land (GHG 
intensity) (Hong et al. 2021). GHG emissions H comprise agricultural CH 4 and N 2O emissions from EDGAR v6.0. The indicated annual growth rates are averaged across the years 
2010–2019 – LULUCF CO 2 emissions are excluded in panel (c). (Note: due to different datasets, the population breakdown for AFOLU emissions is slightly different than that 
in the other sector figures above).
IPCC 2018; Hong  et  al. 2021). Ruminant livestock rearing takes 
place on vast tracts of pasture land worldwide, contributing to 
large quantities of CH 4 emissions from enteric fermentation in Latin 
America (0.8 GtCO 2-eq in 2018), Southern Asia (0.6 GtCO 2-eq), and 
Africa (0.5 GtCO 2-eq), while also playing a sizable role in the total 
AFOLU emissions of most other regions (Lamb et al. 2021b).
In all regions, the amount of land required per unit of agricultural 
output has decreased significantly from 2010 to 2019, with a global 
average of –2.2% yr –1 (land efficiency metric in Figure  2.21). This 
reflects agricultural intensification and technological progress. 
However, in most regions this was mirrored by an increase in output 
per capita, meaning that absolute GHG emissions in most regions 
increased over the last decade. A significant increase in total AFOLU 
emissions occurred in Africa, driven by both increased GHG emissions 
per unit of land and increased populations (Figure 2.21).
The AFOLU sector and its emissions impacts are closely tied to 
global supply chains, with countries in Latin America and South-East 
Asia using large portions of their land for agricultural and forestry 
products exported to other countries (Chapter 7). The strong increases 
in production per capita and associated GHG emissions seen in these 
regions are at least partly attributable to growing exports and not 
national food system or dietary changes. At the same time, efforts to 
promote environmental sustainability in regions such as the EU and 
the USA (but also fast-growing emerging economies such as China) 
can take place at the cost of increasing land displacement elsewhere 
to meet their own demand (Meyfroidt et  al. 2010; Yu et  al. 2013; 
Creutzig et al. 2019).
Global diets are a  key driver of production per  capita, and thus 
land pressure and AFOLU emissions (Chapter  7). As per  capita 
incomes rise and populations urbanise, traditional, low-calorie diets 
that emphasise starchy foods, legumes, and vegetables transition 
towards energy-intensive products such as refined sugars, fats, oils, 
and meat (Pradhan et al. 2013; Tilman and Clark 2014). At a certain 
point in national development, affluence and associated diets thus 
override population growth as the main driver of AFOLU emissions 
(Kastner et  al. 2012). Very high calorie diets have high total GHG 
emissions per  capita (Heller and Keoleian 2015) and are common 
in the developed world (Pradhan et  al. 2013). Over the last few 
decades, a  ‘westernisation’ of diets has also been occurring in 
developing countries (Pradhan et al. 2013). Low- and middle-income 
countries such as India, Brazil, Egypt, Mexico, and South Africa 
have experienced a  rapid dietary shift towards western-style diets 
(De Carvalho et al. 2013; Pradhan et al. 2013; Popkin 2015). Another 
driver of higher food requirements per capita is food waste, which 
has increased more or less continuously since the 1960s in all regions 
but Europe (Porter and Reay 2016).
2.4.3 Poverty and Inequality
Increasing economic inequality globally has given rise to concern 
that unequal societies may be more likely to pollute and degrade 
their environments (Masud et al. 2018; Chancel 2020; Hailemariam 
et al. 2020; Millward-Hopkins and Oswald 2021). The nature of this relationship has important implications for the design of income 
redistribution policies aiming to reduce inequalities (Section  2.6 
presents evidence on how affluence and high consumption relate to 
emissions). Income inequality and carbon intensity of consumption 
differs across countries and individuals (Baležentis et  al. 2020) 
(Section  2.3.3). Reduced income inequality between nations can 
reduce emissions intensity of global income growth, if energy 
intensity reductions from income growth in some nations offset 
increases in energy and emissions from higher growth in other 
nations (Rao and Min 2018). Increasing income inequality between 
individuals can translate into larger energy and emissions inequality 
if higher incomes are spent on more energy-intensive consumption 
and affluent lifestyles (Oswald et  al. 2020; Wiedmann et  al. 2020) 
(Section 2.6).
Literature shows that more equitable income distributions can 
improve environmental quality, but the nature of this relationship 
can vary by level of development (low evidence, medium agreement) 
(Knight et al. 2017; Chen et al. 2020; Hailemariam et al. 2020; Huang 
and Duan 2020; Liobikienė and Rimkuvienė 2020; Rojas-Vallejos 
and Lastuka 2020; Uddin et  al. 2020). Differences in the energy 
and carbon intensities of consumption and the composition of 
consumption baskets across populations and nations matter for 
emissions. (Jorgenson et al. 2016; Grunewald et al. 2017). There is 
evidence to suggest that more equal societies place a higher value 
on environmental public goods (Baumgärtner et  al. 2017; Drupp 
et  al. 2018). Additional research shows that reducing top income 
inequality in OECD countries can reduce carbon emissions and 
improve environmental quality (Hailemariam et  al. 2020) and that 
the effect of wealth inequality, measured as the wealth share of 
the top decile, on per capita emissions in high-income countries, is 
positive (Knight et al. 2017). Evidence from 40 sub-Saharan African 
countries suggests that a  rise in income inequality contributed to 
increasing CO 2 emissions between 2010 and 2016, controlling for 
other drivers such as economic growth, population size, and inflation 
(Baloch et al. 2020).
The key development objective of eradicating extreme poverty 
(Chakravarty and Tavoni 2013; Hubacek et al. 2017a; Malerba 2020) 
and providing universal access to modern energy services (Pachauri 
et al. 2013, 2018; Pachauri 2014; Singh et al. 2017) only marginally 
affects GHG emissions (medium evidence, high agreement). Shifts 
from biomass to more efficient energy sources and collective 
provisioning systems for safe water, health, and education are 
associated with reduced energy demand (Baltruszewicz et al. 2021). 
Efforts to alleviate multi-dimensional poverty by providing minimum 
decent living standards universally, however, may require more energy 
and resources. Recent estimates of the additional energy needed are 
still within bounds of projections of energy demand under climate 
stabilisation scenarios (Hubacek et  al. 2017a, 2017b; Rao et  al. 
2019; Pascale et al. 2020; Kikstra et al. 2021). Bottom-up estimates 
suggest that achieving decent living standards requires 13–40  GJ 
per capita annually, much less than the current world average energy 
consumption of 80 GJ per  capita in 2020 (Millward-Hopkins et  al. 
2020) (medium evidence, high agreement). Aggregate top-down 
estimates suggest that achieving a  high Human Development 
Index (HDI) score above 0.8 requires energy consumption between 
30–100  GJ per  capita yr –1 (Lamb and Rao 2015). There is some 
evidence, however, of a  decoupling between energy consumption 
and HDI over time (Akizu-Gardoki et  al. 2018). The emissions 
consequences of poverty alleviation and decent living also depend on 
whether improvements in well-being occur via energy- and carbon-
intensive industrialisation or low-carbon development (Semieniuk 
and Yakovenko 2020; Fu et al. 2021; Huang and Tian 2021).
2.4.4 Rapid and Large-scale Urbanisation 
as a Driver of GHG Emissions
Economic growth and urbanisation go hand in hand and are both 
influencing GHG emissions. However, the exact role of urban 
development in driving emissions is multi-faceted and heterogeneous, 
depending on development status and other regional factors (medium 
evidence,  high agreement) (Jorgenson et al. 2014; Lamb et al. 2014; 
Liddle and Lung 2014; Creutzig et al. 2015; Pincetl 2017; Azizalrahman 
and Hasyimi 2019; Muñoz et al. 2020). This calls for a differentiated 
assessment. This section assesses the process of rapid urban growth 
in developing countries and how emissions change over time when 
cities’ urban populations and infrastructure expand at fast speed and 
at a massive scale (Seto et al. 2017; Elmqvist et al. 2021). To distinguish, 
Section 2.6 includes the carbon footprint of urban lifestyles and the 
difference in emissions profiles between already urbanised and less 
urbanised areas. Chapter  8 deals with urban strategies for climate 
change mitigation.
Urban development is most significant and rapid in developing and 
transition countries, accompanied by a substantial migration of rural 
populations to urban areas (Apergis and Li 2016; Azizalrahman and 
Hasyimi 2019; Z. Wang et al. 2019) and associated impacts on land 
use (Richardson et  al. 2015). If the trend of developing countries 
following infrastructure stock patterns in industrialised nations 
continues until 2050, this could cause approximately 350 GtCO 2 
from the production of materials (Müller et al. 2013). This would be 
equivalent to 70% of the 500 GtCO 2 estimated remaining carbon 
budget from the beginning of 2020 to limit global warming to 1.5°C 
with a likelihood of 50% (IPCC 2021b).
In many developing countries across the world, the process of urban 
expansion leads to higher per  capita consumption-based GHG 
emissions (medium evidence, high agreement) (Jorgenson et al. 2014; 
Yao et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2016; Wood et al. 2018a; Muñoz et al. 
2020). The high disparity between rural and urban personal carbon 
footprints in these countries (Wiedenhofer et al. 2017) (Section 2.6) 
means that migration to urban areas increases overall emissions as 
levels of income and expenditure rise, leading to further economic 
growth and infrastructure development in urban areas (Müller 
et al. 2013; Li et al. 2015; Wang and Yang 2016; Zhang et al. 2016; 
Wiedenhofer et al. 2017; Cetin and Bakirtas 2019; Fan et al. 2019; 
Li and Zhou 2019; Xia et al. 2019; Sarkodie et al. 2020).
For total production-based emissions in general, urbanisation is 
thought to have a smaller effect than changes in population, GDP 
per capita, and energy and emissions intensities, which are all more 
influential (Lin et al. 2017). Another driver of urban emissions is rising ambient air temperature caused by urban land expansion, which 
will likely drive a  substantive increase in air conditioning use and 
cold storage for food (Huang et al. 2019). Specific emission drivers, 
however, depend on city- and place-specific circumstances such 
as income, household size, density, or local climate (Baiocchi et al. 
2015; H. Wang et al. 2019). Geographical factors, urban form, and 
transport/fuel costs are dependent on each other, and, together with 
economic activity, have been found to explain 37% of urban direct 
energy use and 88% of urban transport energy use in a global sample 
of 274 cities (Creutzig et al. 2015).
2.5 Technological Change is Key 
to Reducing Emissions
Technological change for climate change mitigation involves 
improvement in and adoption of technologies, primarily those 
associated with energy production and use. Technological change 
has had a  mitigating effect on emissions over the long term and 
is central to efforts to achieving climate goals (high confidence). 
Progress since AR5 shows that multiple low-carbon technologies are 
improving and falling in cost (high confidence); technology adoption 
is reaching substantial shares, and small-scale technologies are 
particularly promising on both (medium confidence). Faster adoption 
and continued technological progress can play a  crucial role in 
accelerating the energy transition. However, the historical pace of 
technological change is still insufficient to catalyse a complete and 
timely transition to a low-carbon energy system: technological change 
needs to accelerate (high confidence). This section assesses the role of 
technological change in driving emissions reductions and the factors 
that drive technological change, with an emphasis on the speed of 
transitions. Incentives and support for technological change affect 
technology outcomes (Sivaram et al. 2018; Wilson et al. 2020a). Work 
since AR5 has focused on evaluating the effectiveness of policies: 
those that accelerate technological change by enhancing knowledge 
(technology push) and those that increase market opportunities 
for successful technologies (demand pull) (Nemet 2013); as well 
as the importance of tailoring support to country contexts (Barido 
et al. 2020; Rosenbloom et al. 2020), including the limits of carbon-
pricing policies to date (Lilliestam et  al. 2020). Section  2.8 and 
Chapter 13 describe how these polices affect emissions; Chapter 14 
and Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 16 discuss transition dynamics; 
and Chapter 16 provides a more detailed assessment of the evolution 
and mitigation impacts of technology development, innovation, 
and transfer.
2.5.1 Technological Change Has Reduced Emissions
Technological change that facilitates efficient energy utilisation from 
production to its final conversion into end-use services is a critical 
driver of carbon emissions reductions (high confidence). Technological 
change can facilitate stringent mitigation, but it can also reduce these 
effects by changing consumer behaviour, such as through rebound 
effects (Section 2.6 and Chapter 16). AR6 includes an entire chapter 
on innovation, technology development, and transfer (Chapter 16). 
A  focus gained in this section is the extent to which aligned, 
credible, and durable policies can accelerate technological change 
factors to put emissions reductions on a trajectory compatible with 
reaching United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC) goals.
Technological change has facilitated the provision of more diverse 
and efficient energy services (heating, cooling, lighting, and mobility) 
while generating fewer emissions per  unit of service. As seen in 
Section  2.4, in Kaya identity terms (Lima et  al. 2016) (see ‘Kaya 
identity’ in Glossary): population and economic growth are factors 
that have increased emissions, while technological change has 
reduced emissions (Peters et  al. 2017). These Kaya statistics show 
that, while technological change can facilitate the transition to 
a low-carbon economy, it needs to proceed at a much faster pace 
than historical trends (Peters et al. 2017).
Multiple challenges exist in accelerating the past rate of 
technological change. First, an array of physical assets in the energy 
system are long-lived and thus involve substantial committed carbon 
(Section 2.7) (Knapp 1999; Cui et al. 2019). A process of ‘exnovation’, 
accelerating the phase-out of incumbent technology through 
intentional policy (such as by pricing carbon), provides a means to 
address long lifetimes (Davidson 2019; Rosenbloom and Rinscheid 
2020). Second, countries may not have the capacity to absorb the 
flows of ideas and research results from international knowledge 
spillovers due to weak infrastructure, limited research capacity, lack 
of credit facilities (Chapter 15, Section 15.5), and other barriers to 
technology transfer (Adenle et  al. 2015). In a  developing country 
context, processes of innovation and diffusion need to include 
competence-building systems (Lema et  al. 2015; Perrot and Sanni 
2018; Stender et al. 2020). Third, public policy is central to stimulating 
technological change to reduce emissions; policy depends on creating 
credible expectations of future market opportunities (Alkemade and 
Suurs 2012), but the historical evidence shows that, despite recent 
progress, policies related to energy and climate over the long term 
have been inconsistent (Taylor 2012; Nemet et al. 2013; Koch et al. 
2016). Bolstering the credibility and durability of policies related 
to low-carbon technology are crucial to accelerating technological 
change and inducing the private sector investment required (Helm 
et al. 2003; Habermacher et al. 2020).2.5.2 A Low-carbon Energy Transition Needs 
to Occur Faster Than Previous Transitions
An illuminating debate on the possibility of faster transitions has 
emerged since AR5  – with diverging assumptions about future 
technological change at the core of the discourse (Bazilian et  al. 
2020; Lu and Nemet 2020). Table 2.5 summarises these arguments.
2.5.2.1 Energy Transitions Can Occur Faster Than in the Past
Recent studies have identified examples supporting fast energy 
transitions (Sovacool 2016; Bond et  al. 2019; Reed et  al. 2019). 
One describes five rapid national-scale transitions in end-use 
technologies, including lighting in Sweden, cook-stoves in China, 
liquefied petroleum gas stoves in Indonesia, ethanol vehicles in 
Brazil, and air conditioning in the USA (Sovacool 2016). Adoption of 
electric vehicles in Norway and in cities in China have also been rapid 
(Rietmann and Lieven 2019; Li et al. 2020; Fridstrøm 2021). Examples 
in energy supply, include electrification in Kuwait, natural gas in the 
Netherlands, nuclear electricity in France and Sweden, combined 
heat and power in Denmark, renewable energy in Uruguay, and coal 
retirements in Ontario, Canada (Qvist and Brook 2015). Reasons 
that these exemplars could be applied more broadly in the future 
include: growing urgency on climate change, shifting motivation 
from price response to proactive resource scarcity, and an increase in 
the likelihood of technological breakthroughs (medium confidence) 
(Sovacool 2016; Bazilian et  al. 2020). The emergence of smaller 
unit scale, granular technologies (described below) also creates the 
potential for faster system change (Trancik 2006; Grubler et al. 2018; 
Wilson et al. 2020a). Energy service prices and government actions 
that affect demand are critical to the speed and extent of energy 
transitions (Kramer and Haigh 2009). Reasons scholars consider for 
expecting a fast transition include: intentional policy and alignment 
with goals; globalisation which diversifies sources and integrates 
supply chains; collective action via the Paris Agreement; as well 
as bottom-up grassroots movements and private sector initiatives 
(Kern and Rogge 2016). Political support for change can also speed 
transitions (Burke and Stephens 2017; Stokes and Breetz 2018), as 
can the credibility of transition-related targets (Li and Pye 2018; 
Rogge and Dütschke 2018).

Governance Leaders catalyse faster change Collective action problems
The important role of leader countries is often missed when looking 
only at global aggregates (Meckling and Hughes 2018); leaders 
accumulate important knowledge, provide scaled market, and set 
positive examples for followers (medium confidence) (Schwerhoff 
2016; Buchholz et  al. 2019). In recent years, the conception of 
where leadership, climate-relevant innovation, and technology 
transfer originate has shifted to considering more meaningfully 
direct South-South and South-North forms of technology transfer, 
flows of capital, drivers for market access, origins of innovation, 
and other forms of cooperation (Urban 2018; Köhler et al. 2019). 
Recent evidence shows that South-South trade is enabling clean 
technology transfer (Gosens 2020). Leaders can initiate a process 
of ‘catalytic cooperation’ in which they overcome collective action 
problems and stimulate rapid change (Hale 2018). Similarly, 
‘sensitive intervention points’  – targeted support of social 
movements, technologies, or policies themselves – can lead to rapid 
and self-sustaining change (Farmer et  al. 2019), such as support 
for photovoltaics in Germany in the 2000s and student climate 
activism in Europe in  2019. The focus on leadership, catalysts, 
and intervention points reflects a  systemic view of transitions 
that emphasises interactions and interdependence (Geels 2018; 
Meckling and Hughes 2018). Technological change has been at the 
core of transitions, but is best understood as part of a system in 
which social aspects are crucial (medium confidence) (Cherp et al. 
2018; Köhler et al. 2019; Overland and Sovacool 2020).
2.5.2.2 Reasons Why Transitions Will Occur 
at Historical Rates of Change
Recent work has also reasserted previous claims that the speed 
of a  low-carbon transition will follow historical patterns (low 
confidence). Broad transitions involve technological complexity, 
time-consuming technological development, risk-averse adopters, 
high upfront costs, and low immediate individual adoption benefits, 
attributes that are not all present in the examples of rapid change 
described above (Grubler et al. 2016). Additional factors that slow 
transitions include: the need for the transition to occur globally, thus 
requiring nations with unequal economic resources and development 
circumstances to engage in near-universal participation; slow 
progress in recent decades; intermittence of renewables, and the time 
involved in building supporting infrastructure (Smil 2016); difficulty 
in decarbonising transportation and industry (Rissman et al. 2020); 
and material resource constraints (Davidsson et al. 2014).
2.5.3 Improvements in Technologies 
Enable Faster Adoption
Since AR5, multiple low-carbon technologies have shown dramatic 
improvement, particularly solar photovoltaic (PV), wind, and 
batteries (high confidence). The observed pace of these changes 
and the likelihood of their continuation support the arguments in 
the previous section that future energy transitions are likely to occur 
more quickly than in the past (medium confidence).2.5.3.1 Technological Change Has Produced 
Dramatic Cost Reductions
A wide array of technologies shows long-term improvements in 
performance, efficiency, and cost. Among the most notable are 
solar PV, wind power, and batteries (high confidence) (Chapters 6 
and 16). The dynamics for PVs are the most impressive, having fallen 
in cost by a factor of 10,000 from the first commercial application 
on a  satellite in 1958 (Maycock and Wakefield 1975) to power 
purchase agreements signed in 2019 (IRENA 2020). Wind has been 
on a  nearly as steep trajectory (Wiser and Bolinger 2019) as are 
lithium-ion battery packs for electric vehicles (Nykvist and Nilsson 
2015; Service 2019). The future potential for PV and batteries seems 
especially promising given that neither industry has yet begun to 
adopt alternative materials with attractive properties as the cost 
reductions and performance improvements associated with the 
current generation of each technology continue (medium confidence) 
(Kwade et al. 2018). A key challenge is improving access to finance, 
especially in developing country contexts, where the costs of financing 
are of crucial importance (Creutzig et al. 2017; Schmidt 2019).
2.5.3.2 Technological Change has Accelerated Since AR5
Figure  2.22 shows changes in the costs of four dynamic energy 
technologies. One can see rapid changes since AR5, cost data for 
which ended in 2010. Solar PV is by far the most dynamic technology, 
and its cost since AR5 has continued on its steep decline at about the 
same rate of change as before AR5, but now costs are well within 
the range of fossil fuels (high confidence) (Chapter  6). Very few 
concentrating solar power (CSP) plants had been built between the 
1980s and 2012. Since AR5, 4GW have been built and costs have 
fallen by half. Onshore wind has continued its pace of cost reductions 
such that it is well within the range of fossil fuels. Offshore wind has 
changed the most since AR5. Whereas costs were increasing before 
AR5, they have decreased by 50% since. None of these technologies 
shows indications of reaching a limit in their cost reductions. Crucial 
to their impact will be extending these gains in the electricity and 
transportation sectors to the industrial sector (Davis et al. 2018).
2.5.3.3 Granular Technologies Improve Faster
The array of evidence of technology learning that has accumulated 
both before and since AR5 (Thomassen et al. 2020) has prompted 
investigations about the factors that enable rapid technology 
learning. From the wide variety of factors considered, unit size has 
generated the strongest and most robust results. Smaller unit sizes, 
sometimes referred to as ‘granularity’, tend to be associated with 
faster learning rates (medium confidence) (Sweerts et  al. 2020; 
Wilson et al. 2020). Examples include solar PV, batteries, heat pumps, 
and to some extent wind power. The explanatory mechanisms 
for these observations are manifold and well established: more 
iterations are available with which to make improvements (Trancik 
2006); mass production can be more powerful than economies of 
scale (Dahlgren et al. 2013); project management is simpler and less 
risky (Wilson et al. 2020); the ease of early retirement can enable 
risk-taking for innovative designs (Sweerts et  al. 2020); and they 
tend to be less complicated (Malhotra and Schmidt 2020; Wilson 
et al. 2020). Small technologies often involve iterative production 
processes with many opportunities for learning by doing, and have 
much of the most advanced technology in the production equipment 
than in the product itself. In contrast, large unit scale technologies – 
such as full-scale nuclear power, carbon capture and storage (CCS), 
low-carbon steel making, and negative emissions technologies such 
as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) – are often 
primarily built on site and include thousands to millions of parts, 
such that complexity and system integration issues are paramount 
(Nemet 2019). Despite the accumulating evidence of the benefits 
of granularity, these studies are careful to acknowledge the role 
of other factors in explaining learning. In a  study of 41  energy 
technologies (Figure 2.23), unit size explained 22% of the variation 
in learning rates (Sweerts et al. 2020) and a study of 31 low-carbon 
technologies showed that unit size explained 33% (Wilson et  al. 
2020). Attributing that amount of variation to a  single factor is 
rare in studies of technological change. The large residual has 
motivated studies, which find that small-scale technologies provide opportunities for rapid change, but they do not make rapid change 
inevitable; a  supportive context, including supportive policy and 
complementary technologies, can stimulate more favourable 
technology outcomes (high confidence).
There is also evidence that small technologies not only learn 
but become adopted faster than large technologies (medium 
confidence) (Wilson et al. 2020b). Some of the mechanisms related 
to the adoption rate difference are associated with cost reductions; 
for example, smaller, less lumpy investments involve lower risk 
for adopters (Dahlgren et al. 2013; Wilson et al. 2020b). The shorter 
lifetimes of small technologies allow users to take advantage of new 
performance improvements (Knapp 1999) and access a  large set 
of small adopters (Finger et al. 2019). Other mechanisms for faster 
adoption are distinctly related to markets: modular technologies can 
address a wide variety of niche markets (Geels 2018) with different 
willingness to pay (Nemet 2019) and strategically find protected 
niches while technology is maturing (Coles et al. 2018).

Figure  2.22 | Unit cost reductions and use in some rapidly changing mitigation technologies.  The top panel shows global costs per  unit of energy 
(USD per MWh) for some rapidly changing mitigation technologies. Solid blue lines indicate average unit cost in each year. Light blue shaded areas show the range 
between the 5th and 95th percentiles in each year. Grey shading indicates the range of unit costs for new fossil fuel (coal and gas) power in 2020 (corresponding to 
USD55–148 per MWh). In 2020, the levelised costs of energy (LCOE) of the four renewable energy technologies could compete with fossil fuels in many places. For batteries, 
costs shown are for 1 kWh of battery storage capacity; for the others, costs are LCOE, which includes installation, capital, operations, and maintenance costs per MWh of 
electricity produced. The literature uses LCOE because it allows consistent comparisons of cost trends across a diverse set of energy technologies to be made. However, it 
does not include the costs of grid integration or climate impacts. Further, LCOE does not take into account other environmental and social externalities that may modify the 
overall (monetary and non-monetary) costs of technologies and alter their deployment. The bottom panel shows cumulative global adoption for each technology, in GW 
of installed capacity for renewable energy and in millions of vehicles for battery-electric vehicles. A vertical dashed line is placed in 2010 to indicate the change since AR5. 
Shares of electricity produced and share of passenger vehicle fleet are indicated in text for 2020 based on provisional data, i.e., percentage of total electricity production 
(for PV , onshore wind, offshore wind, CSP) and of total stock of passenger vehicles (for EVs). The electricity production share reflects different capacity factors; for example, 
for the same amount of installed capacity, wind produces about twice as much electricity as solar PV . {2.5, 6.4} Renewable energy and battery technologies were selected as 
illustrative examples because they have recently shown rapid changes in costs and adoption, and because consistent data are available. Other mitigation options assessed 
in the report are not included as they do not meet these criteria.
2.5.4 Rapid Adoption Accelerates Energy Transitions
The transition to a  more sustainable energy system depends not 
just on improvement in technologies, but also on their widespread 
adoption. Work since AR5 has also substantiated the bidirectional 
causal link between technology improvement and adoption. Cost 
reductions facilitate adoption, which generates opportunities for 
further cost reductions through a  process of learning by doing 
(medium confidence). The rate of adoption is thus closely related to 
the speed at which an energy transition is possible.
Results of integrated assessment models (IAMs) show that scale-up 
needs are massive for 2°C scenarios. Using logistic growth rates of 
energy shares as in previous work (Wilson 2012; Cherp et al. 2021), 
most of these technologies include annual adoption growth rates of 
20% in the 2020s and 2030s, and are in line with recent adoption 
of wind and solar. However, it is important to realise that IAMs 
include faster adoption rates for some mitigation technologies than 
for others (Peters et al. 2017). Growth rates in IAMs for large-scale 
CCS – biomass, coal, and gas – are between 15–30% (25th and 75th 
percentiles) (Figure 2.24). So few plants have been built that there 
is little historical data to analyse expected growth; with only two 
full-scale CCS power plants built and a 7% growth rate, if including 
industrial CCS. In contrast, IAMs indicate that they expect much 
lower rates of growth in future years for the technologies that have 
been growing fastest in recent years (wind and solar), without strong 
evidence for why this should occur.The overall pattern shows that IAMs expect growth in small-scale 
renewables to fall to less than half of their recent pace, and large-
scale CCS to more than double from the limited deployment assessed 
(high confidence). The emerging work since AR5 showing the rapid 
adoption and faster learning in small-scale technologies should 
prompt a keener focus on what technologies the world can depend 
on to scale up quickly (Grubb et al. 2021). The scenario results make 
it quite clear that climate stabilisation depends on rapid adoption of 
low-carbon technologies throughout the 2020–2040 period.

2.6 Behavioural Choices and Lifestyles
2.6.1 Introduction
This section synthesises how behavioural choices, lifestyles, and 
consumption preferences affect energy use and emissions. Household 
consumption is the largest component of a country’s gross domestic 
product (GDP) and the main contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions through direct energy consumption for heating and 
cooling or private transportation, and indirectly through carbon 
emitted during production of final consumption items. There is 
great variation in individual, group and household behaviour and 
consumption patterns within and between countries and over time. 
A  number of factors affect people’s consumption patterns and 
associated carbon emissions, such as: socio-demographics; socio-
economic status; infrastructure and access to public services; the 
regulatory framework; availability, affordability and accessibility of 
more or less sustainable choices on markets; and individual values 
and preferences (Dietz et al. 2009).
Carbon footprints vary between and within countries and show an 
uneven distribution because of differences in development levels, 
economic structure, economic cycle, available public infrastructure, 
climate and residential lifestyles (Bruckner et  al. 2021). Similar 
emission characteristics can also be found within a country – see, 
for China; Feng et al. (2013); for the USA: Pizer et al. (2010); Feng 
et  al. (2013); Miehe et  al. (2016); Hubacek et  al. (2017b); Wang 
et al. (2018); for Brazil: Sanches-Pereira et al. (2016); and for Latin 
American countries: Zhong et al. (2020).In western countries, the largest contribution to the household 
carbon footprint is from transportation, housing, and consumption 
of food (Druckman and Jackson 2015). The joint contribution 
of these three items varies in different countries, depending on 
consumption patterns, and account for 58.5%, on average, in EU25 
countries (Tukker and Jansen 2006). However, different countries, 
and regions within countries, may have different emission patterns 
due to differences in income, lifestyle, geography, infrastructure, 
political and economic situation. For example, the main contributors 
to the average US household is private transport (19.6%), followed 
by electricity (14.8%) and meat (5.2%) (Jones and Kammen 2011), 
while UK households have 24.6% emissions on energy and housing, 
13.7% emissions on food, and 12.2% emissions on consumables 
(Gough et al. 2011). A study of 49 Japanese cities found that energy 
(31%), food (27%), and accommodation (15%) were the largest 
sources of household emissions (Long et al. 2017). An investigation 
of Japan’s household emissions found that energy, food, and utility 
are the three main emissions sources, but their shares are dependent 
on age (Shigetomi et al. 2014). See Section 12.4 (Chapter 12) and 
Box 5.4 (Chapter 5) for a more in-depth discussion on food systems 
and dietary shifts towards lower emission food.
In terms of rapidly growing economies, China is the most extensively 
researched country. China’s household emissions were primarily 
derived from electricity and coal consumption, as well as residents’ 
consumption of emission-intensive products, such as housing (33.4%), 
food (23.6%), private transportation and communication (14.8%) 
(Wang et al. 2018). Space heating was the largest contributor among 
various daily energy uses in northern cities (Yang and Liu 2017). In 
comparison, Indonesian rural households have a  larger emission

share on food and a much smaller share on services and recreation 
than urban households (Irfany and Klasen 2017). Urban Indonesian 
households have a much larger share of transport-related emissions 
(Irfany and Klasen 2017). Analysis from the Philippines shows that, on 
average, households in urban areas emit twice as much as rural ones 
because of much lower direct energy use in homes and for transport 
in rural areas (Serino 2017). In other emerging economies, such 
as India, Brazil, Turkey and South Africa, a high share of transport-
related carbon emissions among urban middle- and high-income 
households is evident (Huang and Tian 2021).
2.6.2 Factors Affecting Household Consumption 
Patterns and Behavioural Choices
Households’ carbon emissions are closely linked to activities and 
consumption patterns of individuals and as a group in households. 
Individual and group behaviour, in turn, is shaped by economic, 
technological, and psychological factors, social contexts (such as 
family ties, friends and peer pressure) and cultural contexts (social 
identity, status, and norms) as well as the natural environment 
(number of hot and cold days) and physical infrastructure, or 
geography (Jorgenson et  al. 2019). For example, a  city with an 
excellent bicycle infrastructure will make it safer and easier for 
citizens to become highly mobile by using their bikes; a city that 
has less density and is dominated by automobile infrastructure 
induces more people to travel by car (Chapters 8 and 10). 
As  a  consequence, many climate relevant consumption acts are 
not consciously decided on or deliberately made part of a lifestyle, 
but are strongly influenced by the factors listed above. Chapter 5 
provides a  more in-depth discussion on behavioural drivers and 
examples of behavioural interventions and policies that can be 
used to reduce emissions.
Demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and education 
constitute an important set of determinants influencing emissions 
patterns. People of different genders have different consumption 
patterns. For example, men tend to consume more food (especially 
meat) than women, leading to higher food-related emissions. Also, 
men spend more money on vehicles and driving (Wang et al. 2018). 
Similar evidence has been found in Germany, Greece, Norway, and 
Sweden, where men’s energy use is 8%, 39%, 6%, and 22% higher 
than women’s, respectively (Räty and Carlsson-Kanyama 2010).
Income. Due to the differences that shape individuals’ consumption 
patterns, there are enormous differences in the associated carbon 
footprints – with income being one of the most important predictors. 
Globally, households with income in the top 10% – income higher 
than USD23.03 purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita per day – 
are responsible for 34–45% of GHG emissions, while those in the 
bottom 50% – income less than USD2.97 PPP per capita per day – are responsible for only 13–15% of emissions, depending on the study 
(Chancel and Piketty 2015; Hubacek et al. 2017b) (Figure 2.25). The 
average carbon footprint of the high household incomes is more than 
an order of magnitudes larger than that of the lowest expenditure 
group (Feng et al. 2021). For example, Zhang et al. (2016) analysed 
the impact of household consumption across different income 
households on CO 2 emissions in China and concluded that the impact 
on CO 2 emissions generated by urban households’ consumption is 
1.8 times as much as that of rural ones. High-income households 
have higher emissions related to transport and entertainment – such 
as recreational expenditure, travel, and eating out – than low-income 
households. Low-income households tend to have a  larger share 
on necessities such as fuel for heating and cooking (Kerkhof et al. 
2009). Figure 2.25 shows the carbon footprint per capita ranked by 
per capita income.
Age. The effect of population ageing on emissions is contested in 
the literature. Ageing when accompanied by shrinking household 
size and more energy-intensive consumption and activity patterns 
results in increased emissions. However, an ageing labour force can 
also dampen economic growth and result in less energy-intensive 
activity such as driving, which decreases emissions (Liddle and 
Lung 2010; Liddle 2011). Ageing of the population characterises the 
demographic transition in both developed and developing countries. 
The implications of ageing for emissions depend on labour force 
participation of the elderly and differences in the consumption and 
investment patterns of different age groups (O’Neill et  al. 2012). 
Analysis using panel macro data from OECD countries suggests that 
shifts in age and cohort composition have contributed to rising GHG 
emissions since the 1960s (Menz and Welsch 2012; Nassen 2014). 
Household-level data over time for the USA provides evidence 
that residential energy consumption increases over the lifetime 
of household members, largely due to accompanying changes in 
household size (Estiri and Zagheni 2019). Similar insights emerge 
from Japan, where analysis shows that those in their 70s or older, 
a group that is growing in size in Japan, have higher emissions than 
other age groups (Shigetomi et al. 2014, 2018, 2019). Recent analysis 
from China suggests that the shift to smaller and ageing households 
is resulting in higher carbon emissions because of the accompanying 
time-use and consumption shifts (Yu et al. 2018; Li and Zhou 2019). 
An increase in the dependency ratio  – that is, the proportion of 
children aged under 15 and people over 65 relative to the working-
age population  – in other analyses, has been shown to  lead to 
reduced CO 2 emissions in China (Wei et al. 2018; Li and Zhou 2019). 
Implications of the nature of this relationship are important to policy 
discussions of working hours and retirement age that are likely to 
have an influence on emissions. For example, children and youth 
tend to emit more education-related emissions than adults (Han 
et al. 2015). Older people tend to have higher emissions related to 
heating and cooling being more sensitive to temperature (Meier and 
Rehdanz 2010).Figure 2.25 (continued): Carbon footprints per capita income and expenditure category for 109 countries ranked by per capita income (consumption-
based emissions).  Notes: countries and income categories are dependent on data availability. Light blue dots represent income quintiles (lowest, low, middle, higher, 
and highest) of EU countries and the USA. Yellow dots are for the developing country group provided by the World Bank for four expenditure categories: lowest, low, middle 
and higher (Hubacek et al. 2017b). Dark blue diamonds represent average per capita carbon footprints. Countries are ranked from the lowest per capita income (bottom) to 
the highest income (top) within each country group. Countries are grouped using the IPCC’s six high-level classification categories. Footprint values for higher income groups 
in the World Bank data are less reliable.
Household size. Per capita emissions tend to decrease with family 
size, as living together becomes more energy efficient (Qu et  al. 
2013). The household size in most countries is decreasing (Liu et al. 
2011), but the degree differs across countries – for example, there is 
a higher decrease rate in China than in Canada and the UK (Maraseni 
et al. 2015). The evidence shows that shifts to smaller households are 
associated with larger per-capita footprints (Liddle and Lung 2014; 
Underwood and Zahran 2015; Ivanova et al. 2017; Wiedenhofer et al. 
2018), at least in developed countries (Meangbua et al. 2019).
Urban living. The carbon footprint of individuals and households 
is also significantly influenced by urban-rural differences (Ivanova 
et al. 2018; Wiedenhofer et al. 2018). In some cases, the difference 
can be explained by the effect of locational and spatial configuration 
characteristics, such as levels of compactness/density, centrality, 
proximity and ease of access to services. In all these parameters, urban 
areas score higher compared with rural or peri-urban (outlying and 
suburban) areas, thus influencing household emissions in different 
ways. Urban households tend to have higher emissions than rural 
households (O’Neill et al. 2010; Liu et al. 2011), but with adifferent 
energy and consumption structures. For example, rural households 
have more diverse energy inputs, such as biomass, biogas, solar, wind, 
small hydro and geothermal in addition to coal (Maraseni et al. 2016).
In terms of indirect emissions, urban households have more service-
related emissions  – such as from education and entertainment  – 
than rural households, while rural households tend to have higher 
emissions related to food consumption or transportation (Büchs and 
Schnepf 2013; Maraseni et al. 2016) but this is strongly dependent 
on the specific situation of the respective country, as in poorer 
regions, rural transport might be mainly based on public transport 
with lower carbon emissions per capita. Centrality and location also 
play a  role on the level of urban household emissions. Studies on 
US  households  found that residents in the urban core have 20% 
lower household emissions than residents in suburbs, which show 
a large range of household emissions (from –50% to +60%) (Kahn 
2000; Jones and Kammen 2014). Higher population density tends to 
be associated with lower per capita emissions (Liddle and Lung 2014; 
Liu et al. 2017).
Location choices are a significant contributor to household emissions. 
Suburbanites tend to own larger, spacious homes with larger heating 
and cooling requirements. Commuting distance and access to public 
transportation, recreation areas, city centres, public services, and 
shops are other important neighbourhood-specific determinants 
of carbon emissions (Baiocchi et  al. 2010) (see more on this in 
Chapters 8 and 10).
Time use. A  study on the emissions implications of time use 
(Wiedenhofer et  al. 2018) found that the most carbon-intensive 
activities are personal care, eating and drinking and commuting. 
Indirect emissions are also high for repairs and gardening. In 
contrast, home-based activities, such as sleep and resting, cleaning 
and socialising at home, have low carbon intensities per  hour of 
time use. The same study also found that households in cities and 
areas with higher incomes tend to substitute personal activities 
for contracted services, thus shifting away from households to the service sector (Wiedenhofer et  al. 2018). Improvements in the 
efficiency of time or resource use are diminished by rebound effects 
that have been shown to reduce emissions savings by 20–40% on 
average (Gillingham et  al. 2015), while other authors argue that, 
potentially, the size of the rebound effect could be larger (Saunders 
2015) (see more coverage of the rebound effect in Chapters 9 and 
16). Lifestyle shifts brought about by using information technologies 
and socio-technological changes are inducing alterations in people’s 
daily activities and time-use patterns.
The reduction of working hours is increasingly discussed as an 
approach to improve well-being and reduce emissions (Fitzgerald 
et al. 2015, 2018; Melo et al. 2018; Wiedenhofer et al. 2018; Smetschka 
et  al. 2019). For instance, analysis of differences in working hours 
across the USA for the period 2007–2013 shows that there is a strong 
positive relationship between carbon emissions and working hours. 
This relationship holds, even after controlling for other differences in 
political, demographic and economic drivers of emissions (Fitzgerald 
et  al. 2018). In other analyses, this relationship is seen to hold in 
both developed and developing countries (Fitzgerald et  al. 2015). 
One recent study, however, finds evidence of nonlinear relationships 
between working time and environmental pressure in EU15 countries 
between 1970 and 2010, in cases where non-work time is spent 
instead in carbon-intensive leisure activities (Shao and Shen 2017).
Social norms. Evidence from experiments in the US shows that 
social norms cannot only help in reducing a  household’s absolute 
level of electricity use but also shift the time of use to periods when 
more renewable electricity is in the system (Horne and Kennedy, 
2017). Analysis from Sweden shows that adoption of sustainable 
innovations like solar panels is influenced by perceived behaviour 
and expectations of others (Palm, 2017). Similar conclusions emerge 
from analysis in the Netherlands on the adoption of electric vehicles 
and smart energy systems (Noppers et al. 2019).
Broader contextual factors and cultural trends towards consumerism, 
individualisation and defining self-worth through conspicuous 
consumption can drive emissions up (Chancel and Piketty, 2015). 
However, cohort and generational shifts can drive emissions down. 
For instance, evidence, from millennials in the OECD shows that fewer 
younger people have driving licenses compared to older generations 
(Kuhnimhof et al. 2012). Similar, findings are evident from analysis for 
the US, where changing attitudes, decreased employment and rising 
virtual mobility explain decreased travel by Millennials (McDonald, 
2015). Analysis for France shows that baby boomers are higher 
emitters than other generations (Chancel, 2014). A change in social 
norms is taking place with the spread of the sharing economy by 
which consumers share or borrow goods from other consumers. 
Sharing opportunities are more advanced within the mobility sector 
(Greenblatt and Shaheen, 2015). Successful car and bike sharing 
have rapidly expanded in countries such as China, Indonesia, Mexico, 
Brazil and Turkey. Technology and data advances are currently barriers 
to spreading of sharing in low- and lower middle-income cities but 
the potential offered by these technologies to allow poor countries 
to leapfrog to more integrated, efficient, multimodal transport 
systems is important (Yanocha et  al. 2020). Despite this potential 
it is unclear how much shared mobility contributes to transport 
decarbonisation or to make it worse as it takes away riders from 
public transit (ITF , 2019). The evidence so far shows that the potential 
positive impacts of shared mobility with pooled rides in lowering 
travel costs, abating congestion, and reduced GHG emissions have 
not materialised to date (Merlin, 2019) (Chapter 5).
Education and environmental knowledge. A positive relationship 
was found between general and carbon-specific knowledge and 
the attitude towards carbon-specific behaviours in US consumers 
(Polonsky et  al. 2012). One example, pertaining to students, 
found that the gain of environmental knowledge resulted in more 
environmentally favourable attitude among these high school 
students (Bradley et  al. 1999). A  comparison across states in the 
USA, for example, shows that environmental awareness can be 
a mitigating factor of territorial GHG emissions (Dietz et al. 2015). 
A 1% increase in ‘environmentalism’ – defined as the ‘environmental 
voting record of the state’s Congressional delegation’ (Dietz et  al. 
2015) – leads to a 0.45% decrease in emissions.
Environmental knowledge is not always directly translating into 
decreased ecological footprint (Csutora 2012). While pro-environmental 
action is lagging behind, research shows that this is not caused by 
people undervaluing the environment, but rather by people structurally 
underestimating how much others care (Bouman and Steg 2019). Other 
evidence shows that there are multiple causal pathways through which 
a more educated population can effect emissions, some of which may 
be positive and others negative (Lutz et al. 2019). A more educated 
population is more productive and can drive higher economic growth 
and therefore emissions (Lenzen and Cummins 2013). Moreover, 
education that is designed to specifically inform decision makers of 
the impacts of their decisions and provide behavioural nudges can be 
a way to reduce emissions (Duarte et al. 2016).
Status competition. As part of a  larger consumer society and 
consumer culture, based on consumer-oriented lifestyles, products 
frequently provide a  source for identity and fulfilment (Stearns 
2001; Baudrillard 2017; Jorgenson et  al. 2019). People pursue 
cultural constructs such as status, comfort, convenience, hygiene, 
nutrition, and necessity. Consumption is, by and large, not an end 
in itself but a  means to achieve some other end, and those ends 
are diverse and not necessarily connected to one another (Wilk 
2010). This shows that consumption patterns cannot be sufficiently 
understood without also considering the context – for example, the 
cultural and social contexts leading to status competition and status-
related consumption (Veblen 2009; Ehrhardt-Martinez, K. et al. 2015; 
Wilk 2017). Status seeking can work to reduce emissions when 
‘green products’ such as an electric car or photovoltaics on the roof 
become a sign for high-status (Griskevicius et al. 2010). It also can 
work to increase emissions through visible and high-carbon intensive 
consumption items, such a larger homes, fuel-inefficient sport utility 
vehicles (SUVs), and long-distance vacations (Schor 1998), driven 
by a  notion of having ‘to keep up with the Joneses’ (Hamilton 
2011). This can lead to formation of new habits and needs, where 
products and services become normalised and are quickly perceived 
as needed, reinforced through social networks and advertisement, 
making it psychologically easy to convert a luxury item to a perceived 
necessity (Assadour 2012). For example, the share of adults who consider a microwave a necessity was about one-third in 1996 but 
had increased to more than two-thirds in 2006, but retreated in 
importance during the recession years 2008–2009 (Morin and Taylor 
2009). Similar ups and downs have been observed for television 
sets, air conditioning, dishwashers or clothes dryers. (Druckman and 
Jackson 2009). Basic needs and luxury items are subject to change 
over one’s lifetime and in relation to others (Horowitz 1988). This 
shows that the boundaries of the public’s luxury-versus-necessity 
perceptions are malleable (Morin and Taylor 2009).
Inequality. Global inequality within and between countries has 
shifted over the last decade’s expanding consumption and consumer 
culture (Castilhos and Fonseca 2016; Alvaredo et al. 2018; Short and 
Martínez 2020). The rise of income of middle-class in countries, mostly 
in Asia – for example, China, India, Indonesia and Vietnam – and the 
stagnating incomes of the middle classes in developed economies 
reduced between countries’ income differences; meanwhile, the 
population under extreme poverty (a threshold of USD1.9 per person 
per day) is now concentrated in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia 
(Milanović 2016). A  major gap between top and bottom incomes 
occurred in parallel within countries. Since 1980, the top 1% richest 
individuals in the world captured twice as much growth as the 
bottom 50% individuals (Friedman and Savage 2017; Alvaredo et al. 
2018). The influence of these dual inequality trends on lifestyles, 
new consumption patterns and carbon emissions at regional, local 
and global scale are large and have led to the fastest growth of 
global carbon emissions, in particular, for fast emerging economies 
(Sections 2.2. and 2.3). Emissions remain highly concentrated, with 
the top 10% per capita emitters contributing to between 35–45% 
of global emissions, while the bottom 50% emitters contribute to 
13–15% of global emissions (Hubacek et  al. 2017a). Furthermore, 
the top 1% of income earners by some estimates could have an 
average carbon footprint 175 times that of an average person in the 
bottom 10% (Otto et al. 2020). The top 10% high emitters live in all 
continents, and one-third of them live in emerging countries (Chancel 
and Piketty 2015; Hubacek et al. 2017a; Semieniuk and Yakovenko 
2020). Mitigation pathways need to consider how to minimise the 
impacts of inequality on climate change and the different mechanisms 
and effects coming into play between the inequality of income and 
emissions (Baek and Gweisah 2013; Berthe and Elie 2015; Hao et al. 
2016; Grunewald et al. 2017) (Section 2.4.3).
Inequality trends catalyse impact at a  demand level, mobilising 
rapid lifestyles changes, symbolic consumption and ideals of 
material improvements and upward mobility (Castilhos et al. 2017) 
and emulation of high-carbon emissions intensive lifestyle of the 
wealthy (Gough 2017). Decoupling energy use and emissions from 
income growth and the decarbonisation of energy services have 
not counteracted these trends (Section 2.4.1). Alternative options to 
deal with carbon inequality, such as sharing global carbon emissions 
among high emitters (Chakravarty et  al. 2009; Chakravarty and 
Tavoni 2013) or addressing the discourse of income distribution 
and the carbon intensity of high emitters lifestyles (Hubacek et al., 
2017b; Gössling 2019; Otto et al. 2019) are met with caution that 
such alternatives may necessitate hard-to-implement institutional 
changes (Semieniuk and Yakovenko 2020). Growing inequality within 
countries may make recomposition of emission intensive consumption 
more difficult and, it may also exacerbate redistribution and social 
cohesion dilemmas (Gough 2017; Römpke et  al. 2019). Climate 
mitigation action has different motivational departures in unequal 
context. An emerging global ‘middle class’ strengthens consumption 
at the margin as evidence by first-time purchases of white goods 
with likely impacts on energy demand (Wolfram et  al. 2012), and 
with a warming climate, the increased use of air conditioning (Davis 
and Gertler 2015). Inequality may affect the willingness of rich and 
poor to pay for environmental goods or accept policies to protect 
the environment (Baumgärtner et  al. 2017). Unequal departure 
for action is strongly manifested in cities of all sizes in developing 
countries with low-income urban residents hardest hit in lock-in 
situations such as lack of access to transportation and jobs (Altshuler 
2013; Mattioli 2017), lack of green spaces (Joassart-Marcelli et al. 
2011), poor access to waste collection (King and Gutberlet 2013) 
and to energy and clean water provision. The exacerbation of 
these conditions constrains the feasibility for achieving emissions 
reductions through lifestyle or behavioural changes alone (Baiocchi 
et al. 2010; Oxfam 2015). High inequality limits mitigation efforts and 
conversely, advancing mitigation should not contribute to deepen 
existing inequalities (Rao and Min 2018; Saheb et  al. 2019). It is 
critically important to account for varying demands and affordability 
across heterogeneous household groups in access to quality energy, 
education, health, decent jobs and services, while recomposing 
consumption and balancing societal trade-offs via policies to boost 
the inclusion of low-income and energy-poor population groups 
(Pachauri et al. 2013). Further, there is a need to reduce inequalities 
and improve the capabilities people have to live the lives they value 
(Sen 1999; Gough et al. 2011; Gough, 2017; Aranoff et al. 2019).
2.7 Emissions Associated With Existing 
and Planned Long-lived Infrastructure
2.7.1 Introduction: Clarification of Concepts
Carbon lock-in can be understood as inertia in a system that limits 
the rate of transformation by a path-dependent process (Seto et al. 
2016). For example, long lifetimes of infrastructures such as power 
plants, roads, buildings or industrial plants may influence the rate 
of transformation substantially and lock societies into carbon-
intensive lifestyles and practices for many decades (Unruh 2000, 
2002; Unruh and Carrillo-Hermosilla 2006; Grubler 2012; Seto et al. 
2016; Sovacool 2016). Infrastructure stock evolution depends on 
technological and economic factors, but also on institutional and 
behavioural ones that are often mutually reinforcing. That is, physical 
infrastructure such as the built environment of urban areas can shape 
people’s behaviour and practices, which in turn change the demand 
for such infrastructure and lock-in energy demand patterns (Banister 
et al. 1997; Makido et al. 2012; Creutzig et al. 2016; Seto et al. 2016; 
Shove and Trentmann 2018).
There is a broad literature on carbon lock-in related to infrastructure 
that has analysed different geographical scales and sectors, with 
a  strong focus on the power sector (Fisch-Romito et  al. 2020). 
Available quantifications differ in the time frames of analysis that can 
be classified as backward-looking, static for a given year, or forward-looking using scenarios (Fisch-Romito et  al. 2020). Quantifications 
also differ in the indicators used to describe carbon lock-in. Literature 
has assessed how delays in climate policy affect the evolution of 
fossil-fuel infrastructure stock in the short term (Bertram et al. 2015; 
Kefford et  al. 2018; McGlade et  al. 2018), overall mitigation costs 
(Riahi et al. 2015; Luderer et al. 2016), or the transition risks from 
premature retirements or underutilisation of existing assets (Iyer 
et al. 2015; Johnson et al. 2015; Lane et al. 2016; Luderer et al. 2016; 
Farfan and Breyer 2017; van Soest et al. 2017; Kefford et al. 2018; Cui 
et al. 2019; Fofrich et al. 2020; Malik et al. 2020; H. Wang et al. 2020; 
Pradhan et al. 2021). Only a few authors have relied on indicators 
related to institutional factors such as technology scale or employment 
(Erickson et al. 2015; Spencer et al. 2018). Complementary literature 
has explored how the sheer size of the world’s fossil fuel reserves (and 
resources) and owners’ financial interests could contribute to supply-
side dynamics that sustain the use of fossil fuels (Jewell et al. 2013; 
Jakob and Hilaire 2015; McGlade and Ekins 2015; Bauer et al. 2016; 
Heede and Oreskes 2016; Welsby et al. 2021).
One way of quantifying potential carbon lock-in is to estimate the 
future CO 2 emissions from existing and planned infrastructure (Davis 
et al. 2010; Davis and Socolow 2014) based on historic patterns of 
use and decommissioning. Such estimates focus on CO 2 emissions 
from operating infrastructure and do not comprise any upstream 
or downstream emissions across the lifecycle, which are provided 
elsewhere in the literature (Müller et al. 2013; Creutzig et al. 2016; 
Krausmann et al. 2020; Fisch-Romito 2021). Estimates tend to focus 
on energy, while other areas, such as the agricultural sector are 
usually not covered. Another strand of literature quantifies lock-in by 
estimating fossil-fuel related CO 2 emissions that are hard to avoid in 
future scenarios using integrated assessment models (IAMs) (Kriegler 
et al. 2018b; Luderer et al. 2018). The remainder of this chapter will 
assess potential carbon lock-in through those two related strands 
of literature.
2.7.2 Estimates of Future CO 2 Emissions 
From Long-lived Infrastructures
Table  2.6 summarises studies that apply an accounting approach 
based on plant-level data to quantify future CO 2 emissions from long-
lived fossil fuel infrastructure (Davis et al. 2010; Davis and Socolow 
2014; Rozenberg et  al. 2015; Edenhofer et  al. 2018; Pfeiffer et  al. 
2018; Cui et al. 2019; Smith et al. 2019; Tong et al. 2019; Pradhan 
et al. 2021). Differences between studies arise in the scope of the 
infrastructure covered (including resolution), the inclusion of new 
infrastructure proposals, the exact estimation methodology applied 
as well as their assessments of uncertainties. Other studies provide 
analysis with a sectoral focus (Bullock et al. 2020; Vogl et al. 2021) or 
with a regional focus on the power sector (Shearer et al. 2017, 2020; 
González-Mahecha et al. 2019; Grubert 2020; Tao et al. 2020).
Assuming variations in historic patterns of use and decommissioning, 
comprehensive estimates of cumulative future CO 2 emissions from 
current fossil fuel infrastructures are 720 (550–910) GtCO 2 (Smith 
et al. 2019) and 660 (460–890) (high confidence) (Tong et al. 2019) 
(Table  2.6 and Figure  2.26). This is about the same size as the 
Table 2.6 | Comparing cumulative future CO 2 emissions estimates from existing and proposed long-lived infrastructures by sector.  Future CO 2 emissions estimates are reported from the ‘year of dataset’. Note that, in some 
cases, the totals may not correspond to the sum of underlying sectors due to rounding (based on Tong et al. 2019). Initial estimates of future CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel infrastructures by Davis et al. (2010) are considerably lower than more 
recent estimates by Smith et al. (2019) and Tong et al. (2019) due to substantial growth in fossil energy infrastructure, as represented by more recent data. Estimates presented here are rounded to two significant digits.

overall cumulative net CO 2 emissions until reaching net zero CO 2 of 

or limited overshoot (Chapter  3). About 50% of cumulative future 
CO2 emissions from current fossil fuel infrastructures come from the 
power sector and 70% of these (or about 40% of the total) are from 
coal plants only. Like global annual CO 2 emissions (Friedlingstein 
et  al. 2020; Peters et  al. 2020), future CO 2 emissions  from fossil 
fuel infrastructures have increased over time  – that is, future CO 2 
emissions from fossil fuel infrastructure additions in a  given year 
still outgrow ‘savings’ from infrastructure retirements (Davis and 
Socolow 2014; Tong et  al. 2019). This could add further inertia to 
the system as it may require more and faster retirement of fossil-
fuel based infrastructures later, and lead to higher costs for meeting 
climate goals (e.g., Bertram et al. 2015; Johnson et al. 2015).
Estimates of total cumulative future CO 2 commitments from proposed 
infrastructure focus only on the power sector due to data availability 
(Table 2.6 and Figure 2.26). Infrastructure proposals can be at various 
stages of development involving very different probabilities of 
implementation. About one-third of the currently proposed projects 
are more probable as they are already under construction (Cui 
et al. 2019). Pfeiffer et al. (2018) and Tong et al. (2019) assess the 
cumulated CO 2 emissions from proposed infrastructure in the entire 
power sector at 270 GtCO 2 and 190 GtCO 2 respectively. Estimates of 
CO2 emissions implications for new coal power infrastructure plans 
are more frequent (Edenhofer et  al. 2018; Pfeiffer et  al. 2018; Cui 
et al. 2019; Tong et al. 2019) ranging between 100 and 210 GtCO 2. 
Differences across estimates of future CO 2 emissions from proposed 
power infrastructure mostly reflect substantial cancellations of coal 
infrastructure proposals in 2017 and 2018 (Tong et al. 2019).The global estimate of future CO 2 emissions from current and 
planned fossil-fuel infrastructures is 850 (600–1100) GtCO 2 (Tong 
et al. 2019). This already exceeds total cumulative net CO 2 emissions 
in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot 
(see above). It is about the same size as the total cumulative net 
CO2 emissions of 890 (640–1160) GtCO 2 from pathways that limit 
warming to 2°C (<67%) (Chapter  3). Hence, cumulative net CO 2 
emissions to limit warming to 2°C (<67%) or lower could already 
be exhausted by current and planned fossil fuel infrastructure (high 
confidence) even though this estimate only covers a fraction of all 
infrastructure developments over the 21st  century as present in 
mitigation pathways, does not cover all sectors (e.g., AFOLU) and 
does not include currently infrastructure development plans in 
transport, buildings, and industry due to a lack of data.
Hence, the Paris climate goals could move out of reach unless there are 
dedicated efforts for early decommissioning, and reduced utilisation of 
existing fossil fuel infrastructures, cancellation of plans for new fossil 
fuel infrastructures, or compensation efforts by removing some of the 
CO2 emissions from the atmosphere (Cui et al. 2019; Smith et al. 2019; 
Tong et al. 2019; Pradhan et al. 2021). For example, Fofrich et al. (2020) 
suggest in a multi-model study that coal and gas power infrastructure 
would need to be retired 30 (19–34) and 24 (21–26) years earlier 
than the historical averages of 39 and 36 years when following 1.5°C 
pathways and 23 (11–33) and 19 (11–16) years earlier when following 
2°C pathways. Cui et al. (2019) arrive at more conservative estimates 
for coal power plants, but only consider the existing and currently 
proposed capacity. Premature retirement of power plants pledged 
by members of the Powering Past Coal Alliance would cut emissions 
by 1.6 GtCO 2, which is 150 times less than future CO 2 emissions from 
existing coal power plants (Jewell et al. 2019).

other sectors (industry, transport, buildings, other fossil fuel infrastructures) and of proposed infrastructures for coal power as well as gas and oil power. Grey bars on the right 
depict the range (5th–95th percentile) in overall cumulative net CO 2 emissions until reaching net zero CO 2 in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot 
(1.5°C scenarios), and in pathways that limit warming to 2°C (<67%) (2°C scenarios). Source: based on Edenhofer et al. (2018) and Tong et al. (2019). 
Few quantifications of carbon lock-in from urban infrastructure, in 
particular urban form, have been attempted, in part because they also 
relate to behaviours that are closely tied to routines and norms that 
co-evolve with ‘hard infrastructures’ and technologies, as well as ‘soft 
infrastructure‘ such as social networks and markets (Seto et al. 2016). 
There are some notable exceptions providing early attempts (Guivarch 
and Hallegatte 2011; Driscoll 2014; Seto et al.2014; Lucon et al. 2014; 
Erickson and Tempest 2015; Creutzig et al. 2016). Creutzig et al. (2016) 
attempt a synthesis of this literature and estimate the total cumulative 
future CO 2 emissions from existing urban infrastructure at 210 Gt, and 
from new infrastructures at 495 Gt for the period 2010–2030.
2.7.3 Synthesis – Comparison with Estimates 
of Residual Fossil Fuel CO 2 Emissions
A complementary strand of literature uses IAMs to assess the cumulative 
gross amount of unabated CO 2 emissions from fossil fuels across 
decarbonisation pathways that are not removed from the system, even 
under strong (short- and long-term) climate policy ambitions. Lower 
bound estimates for such a  minimum amount of unabated residual 
CO2 emissions across the 21st century that is not removed from the 
system, even under very ambitious climate policy assumptions, may 
be around 600–700 GtCO 2 (Kriegler et al. 2018b). This range increases 
to 650–1800 GtCO 2 (Table  2.7) as soon as a  broader set of policy 
assumptions are considered, including delayed action in scenarios that 
limit warming to 1.5°C and 2°C respectively (Luderer et al. 2018).Notably, the lower end of residual fossil fuel emissions in IAM scenarios 
(Luderer et al. 2018) is remarkably similar to global estimates from 
the accounting studies of the previous section, as shown in Table 2.6. 
Yet, there are important conceptual and interpretative differences 
that are also reflected in the very different distribution of reported 
future CO 2 emissions attached to current and future fossil fuel 
infrastructures (Table  2.7). Accounting studies start from granular, 
plant-based data for existing fossil fuel infrastructure and make 
statements about their future CO 2 emissions, assuming variations 
of historic patterns of use and decommissioning. Expansions to the 
future are limited to proposals for new infrastructures that we know 
of today. Scenario studies quantifying residual fossil fuel emissions 
start from aggregate infrastructure descriptions, but dynamically 
update those through new investment decisions in each time step 
across the 21st  century based on the development of energy and 
energy service demands, as well as technology availability, guided by 
defined climate policy goals (or their absence).
In accounting studies, estimates of future CO 2 emissions from current 
fossil fuel infrastructures are dominated by the power sector with 
its large fossil fuel capacities. In contrast, scenario studies highlight 
residual emissions from non-electric energy  – particularly in the 
transport and industry sectors. Fossil-fuel infrastructure in the power 
sector can be much more easily retired than in those sectors, where 
there are fewer and more costly alternatives. IAMs therefore account 
for continued investments into fossil-based energy technologies 
in areas with limited decarbonisation potential, such as some areas of 
Table 2.7 | Residual (gross) fossil fuel emissions (GtCO 2) in climate change mitigation scenarios strengthening mitigation action after 2020 (‘early 
strengthening’), compared to scenarios that keep Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) ambition level until 2030 and only strengthen thereafter.  
Cumulative gross CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel and industry until reaching net zero CO 2 emissions are given in terms of the mean as well as minimum and maximum (in 
parentheses) across seven participating models: AIM/CGE, GCAM, IMAGE, MESSAGES, POLES, REMIND, WITCH. Scenario design prescribes a harmonised, global carbon price 
in line with long-term carbon budget. Delay scenarios follow the same price trajectory, but 10 years later. Carbon dioxide removal requirements represent ex-post calculations 
that subtract gross fossil fuel emissions from the carbon budget associated with the respective long-term warming limit. We take the carbon budget for limiting warming to 
1.5°C with a 50% probability and to 2°C with a 67% probability (Canadell et al. 2021). Hence, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) requirements reflect a minimum amount of CDR 
for a given mitigation trajectory. Results are reported at two significant digits. Sources: Luderer et al. (2018); Tong et al. (2019).

transportation (in particular aviation, shipping and road-based freight) 
or some industrial processes (such as cement production or feedstocks 
for chemicals). This explains the key discrepancies observable in 
Table 2.7. Therefore, our overall assessment of these available lines 
of evidence strongly emphasises the importance of decommissioning, 
reduced utilisation of existing power sector infrastructure, as well as 
continued cancellation of new power sector infrastructures in order 
to limit warming to well below 2°C (high confidence) (Kriegler et al. 
2018b; Luderer et al. 2018; Chen et al. 2019; Cui et al. 2019; Fofrich 
et al. 2020). This is important as the power sector is comparatively easy 
to decarbonise (IPCC 2014a; Krey et al. 2014; Davis et al. 2018; Méjean 
et al. 2019) and it is crucial to make space for residual emissions from 
non-electric energy end uses that are more difficult to mitigate (high 
confidence). Any further delay in climate policy substantially increases 
carbon lock-in and mitigation challenges as well as a dependence on 
carbon dioxide removal technologies for meeting the Paris climate 
goals (Kriegler et al. 2018b; Luderer et al. 2018).
2.8 Climate and Non-Climate Policies 
and Measures and their Impacts 
on Emissions
2.8.1 Introduction
The key to achieving climate change mitigation targets includes 
crafting environmentally effective, economically efficient and socially 
equitable policies. For the purposes of this section, policies are defined 
broadly as actions to guide decisions to reach explicit goals and, 
accordingly, climate (mitigation) policies are the ones whose primary 
objective is to reduce GHG emissions. They include a range of domains 
from economic and institutional to research and development (R&D) 
and social policies, and are implemented by various instruments 
(e.g.,  market-based and regulatory in the economic domain) and 
measures (e.g.,  legal provisions and governance arrangements in 
the institutional domain) (Chapter  13, and see ‘mitigation policies’ 
in Glossary). Yet GHG emissions are also affected by policies enacted in 
various social, economic and environmental areas to pursue primarily 
non-climatic objectives. This section presents succinct assessments of 
the outcomes and effectiveness of a few selected policy instruments 
applied in the last two decades that target climate protection 
(Sections  2.8.2 and 2.8.3) and GHG emissions impacts of selected 
other policies primarily aimed at improvements in environmental 
quality and natural resource management (Section 2.8.4).12
It is rather difficult, though not impossible, to discern the genuine 
impacts of climate and non-climate policies on GHG emissions. 
Most current and past policies target only a  small part of global 
emissions in a  limited geographical area and/or from a  small 
number of economic sectors. However, in addition to the targeted 

presenting comprehensive evaluations of policies and measures.


of tradable emissions permits. The carbon pricing gap measures the difference between actual ECRs and benchmark rates. The carbon pricing gap indicates the extent to 
which polluters do not pay for the damage from carbon emissions.region or sector, policies and measures tend to affect GHG emissions 
in other parts of the world. Emissions leakage is the key channel 
by which such phenomena and complex interactions occur.13 
Uncertainties in impacts, synergies, and trade-offs between policies 
and measures also complicate the evaluation of emissions impacts. 
These make it challenging to identify the impacts of any specific 
policy or measure on emissions of any specific region or sector. 
Rigorous statistical analyses are necessary for building strong 
empirical evidence, but the experience with climate-related policy 
experiments to date is limited.
2.8.2 Comprehensive Multinational Assessments
Comprehensive multinational evaluations with wider regional and 
sectoral coverage enable the assessment of emissions impacts 
without distortions from emissions leakage. Among the wide range 
of climate policy instruments, pricing carbon – such as a carbon tax or 
an emissions trading system – has been one of the most widely used 
and effective options to reduce GHG emissions (robust evidence, 
high agreement). In a comparison of 142 countries with and without 
carbon pricing, countries with a  carbon price show annual CO 2 
emission growth rates of 2 percentage points lower than countries 
without such policies (Best et  al. 2020). A  more comprehensive 
evaluation of carbon prices shows that countries with a lower carbon 
pricing gap (a higher carbon price) tend to be more carbon-efficient, 
that is, they have a lower carbon intensity of GDP (OECD 2018).14 
An empirical analysis of the effects of environmental regulation and 
innovation on the carbon emissions of OECD countries during the 
period 1999–2014 indicates that a 1% increase in environmentally 
friendly patents reduced carbon emissions by 0.017%, and a  1% 
increase in environmental tax revenue per  capita reduced carbon 
emissions by 0.03% (Hashmi and Alam 2019).
Domestic and international climate legislation have also contributed 
to the reduction of GHG emissions. An empirical analysis of legislative 
activity in 133 countries over the period 1999–2016 based on panel 
data indicates that each new law reduced annual CO 2 emissions 
per unit of GDP by 0.78% nationally in the first three years, and by 
1.79% beyond three years. Additionally, climate laws as of 2016 
were associated with an annual reduction in global CO 2 emissions 
of 5.9 GtCO 2 and 38 GtCO 2 cumulatively since 1999 (Eskander and 
Fankhauser 2020). It is notable that 36 countries that accepted legally 
binding targets under the Kyoto Protocol all complied (Shishlov et al. 
2016). It is impossible to disentangle precisely the contribution of 
individual mitigation policies, but it is clear that the participating 
countries, especially those in the OECD, did make substantial policy 
efforts with material impact (Grubb 2016). An ex-post evaluation 
shows a significant impact of the Protocol on emissions reductions 
(Maamoun 2019).
Renewable energy policies, such as Renewable Portfolio Standards 
and Feed-in-Tariff, have played an essential role in the massive 
expansion of renewable energy capacities, another key driver of GHG 
emissions reductions (robust evidence, high agreement). Drivers of 
decreasing CO 2 emissions seen in a group of 18 developed economies 
that decarbonised over the period 2005–2015 are the displacement 
of fossil fuels by renewable energy and decreases in energy use 
(Le Quéré et al. 2019). Renewable energy policies both at the EU and 
member states level have played an essential role in abating GHG 
emissions (ICF International 2016).
2.8.3 National, Sectoral, and Cross-sectoral Policies
2.8.3.1 National and Regional Carbon Pricing
Carbon prices  – such as carbon taxes and GHG emissions trading 
schemes (ETSs)  – are among the most widely used climate policy 
instruments across the globe, together with technology support 
instruments (IRENA 2018). As of May 2020, there were 61 carbon 
pricing schemes in place or scheduled for implementation, consisting 
of 31 ETSs and 30 carbon tax regimes, covering 12 GtCO 2-eq or 
about 22% of annual global GHG emissions (World Bank 2020). The 
performance of carbon pricing in practice varies by countries and 
sectors, and depends on the policy environment (robust evidence, 
high agreement).
The European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), the longest-
standing regional climate policy instrument to date, has reduced 
emissions, though the estimates of the amount vary by study, by 
country, and by sector; ranging from 3–28% (McGuinness and 
Ellerman 2008; Ellerman et  al. 2010; Abrell et  al. 2011; Anderson 
and Di Maria 2011; Egenhofer et al. 2011; Petrick and Wagner 2014; 
Arlinghaus 2015; Martin et al. 2016). The EU ETS avoided emitting 
about 1.2 GtCO 2 between 2008 and 2016 (3.8%), almost half of 
what EU governments promised to reduce under their Kyoto Protocol 
commitments (Bayer and Aklin 2020).
China’s emission trading pilots have resulted in a decline in carbon 
intensity in the pilot provinces by adjusting the industrial structure 
(Zhou et  al. 2019). The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) 
in the USA has induced leakage in emissions through increases in 
electricity generation in surrounding non-RGGI areas, but it has led 
to the reduction of emissions by way of changes in the fuel mix from 
coal to gas (Fell and Maniloff 2018). Actual emissions declined in six 
of the 10 ETSs for which data is available, although other factors, 
such as the 2009 recession, have had significant impacts on those 
emissions as well (Haites et al. 2018).
The evidence of environmental effectiveness of carbon taxes in 
Western European countries is varied depending on country and 
study (robust evidence, high agreement). A  significant impact is 
found in Finland but insignificant impacts are found in Denmark and 
the Netherlands, and there are mixed results for Sweden (Lin and Li 
2011; Brännlund et al. 2014). Only six of the 17 taxes, where data are 
available, have reduced actual emissions subject to the tax. Tax rates 
tend to be too low in many cases and the scale and frequency of the rate changes has not been sufficient to stimulate further emissions 
reductions (Haites et al. 2018).
2.8.3.2 Selected Sectoral Climate Policy Instruments
Many governments have implemented sector-specific policies, in 
addition to nationwide measures, to reduce GHG emissions (high 
confidence). Examples of sectoral climate policies include carbon taxes 
on transportation fuels, low-carbon fuel standards, and regulation of 
coal power generation.
The implementation of a carbon tax and value-added tax on gasoline 
and diesel in Sweden resulted in significant reductions of CO 2 
emissions in the transportation sector (Shmelev and Speck 2018; 
Andersson 2019). An assessment of a variety of carbon tax schemes 
across various sectors in the EU shows a  negative relationship 
between CO 2 emissions and a CO 2 tax (Hájek et al. 2019). In British 
Columbia (Canada), the carbon tax resulted in a decrease in demand 
for gasoline and a reduction in total GHG emissions (not exclusive to 
the transportation sector) estimated to be between 5–15% (Murray 
and Rivers 2015; Rivers and Schaufele 2015). The Low Carbon Fuel 
Standard in California has contributed to reducing carbon emissions 
in the transportation sector by approximately 9.85–13.28% during 
1997–2014 (Huseynov and Palma 2018).
The power sector typically accounts for a large portion of countries’ 
CO2 emissions. Market-based regulation and government subsidies in 
China contributed to improving operational efficiency and reducing 
emissions (Zhao et al. 2015). In addition, the implementation of ultra-
low emission standards has also resulted in a significant reduction in 
emissions from China’s power plants (Tang et al. 2019). Mandatory 
climate and energy policies, including the California Global Warming 
Solutions Act, reduced CO 2 emissions by 2.7–25% of the average 
state-level annual emissions from the power sector over the period 
1990–2014 in the USA. Mandatory GHG registry/reporting, electric 
decoupling and a public benefit fund have been effective in further 
decreasing power sector emissions in the USA (Martin and Saikawa 
2017). In the UK electricity sector, a carbon price floor, combined with 
electricity market reform (competitive auctions for both firm capacity 
and renewable energy), displaced coal, whose share fell from 46% in 

from under 4% in 2008 to 22% by 2017 (Grubb and Newbery 2018). 
See Chapter 13 for more information.
An alternative approach to a carbon tax is an indirect emissions tax 
on fuels such as an excise tax, or on vehicles, based on the expected 
CO2 intensity of new passenger vehicles. Vehicle purchase taxes 
can result in a  reduction in GHG emissions through reducing the 
CO2 emissions intensity of vehicles, while also discouraging new 
vehicle purchases (Aydin and Esen 2018). For example, a vehicle tax 
policy in Norway resulted in a reduction of average CO 2 intensity 
per  kilometre of 7.5 gCO 2  km–1 (Ciccone 2018; Steinsland et  al. 
2018). Despite such evidence, studies of carbon pricing find that 
additional policies are often needed to stimulate sufficient emissions 
reductions in transportation (medium confidence) (Tvinnereim and 
Mehling 2018).
Electric vehicles (EVs) powered by clean electricity can reduce GHG 
emissions, and such policies are important for spurring adoption of 
such vehicles (Kumar and Alok 2020; Thiel et al. 2020). The extent to 
which EV deployment can decrease emissions by replacing internal 
combustion engine-based vehicles depends on the generation 
mix of the electric grid (Abdul-Manan 2015; Nichols et  al. 2015; 
Canals Casals et al. 2016; Hofmann et al. 2016; Choi et al. 2018; 
Teixeira and Sodré 2018) although, even with current grids, EVs 
reduce emissions in almost all cases (Knobloch et al. 2020). Policy 
incentives for EV adoption can be an effective mechanism to 
increase EV sales (Langbroek et al. 2016) and may include discounts, 
purchase subsidies, regulations, and government leadership  
(medium confidence) (Bakker and Jacob Trip 2013; Silvia and Krause 
2016; Teixeira and Sodré 2018; Qiu et al. 2019; Santos and Davies 
2020). The presence of charging infrastructure and publicly available 
charging increases the adoption rate of EVs (Vergis and Chen 
2015; Javid et al. 2019). A comparison of EV adoption rates across 

and EV market share (Sierzchula et al. 2014). A rollout of 80,000 DC 
fast chargers across the USA is estimated to have resulted in a 4% 
reduction in emissions compared to a baseline of no additional fast 
chargers (Levinson and West 2018). More recently, bans on internal 
combustion engine vehicles have provided a  much more direct 
approach to stimulating the adoption of EVs and its supporting 
infrastructure; however, the efficacy of such measures depends on 
enforcement (Plötz et al. 2019).
Public transit can reduce vehicle travel and lower GHG emissions by 
reducing the number of trips taken by private vehicles and the length 
of those trips (medium confidence). Changes to the operation of 
public transportation systems (such as density of bus stops, distance 
from stops to households, duration and frequency of trip times, and 
lowering ridership costs) can result in a  mode shift from private 
car trips to public transit trips (Cats et al. 2017; Choi 2018; Carroll 
et  al. 2019). These changes in the public transit system operation 
and network optimisation have been shown to have reduced GHG 
emissions in cases such as San Francisco, where the cost optimisation 
of the transit network was estimated to decrease emissions by 
a  factor of three (Cheng et  al. 2018) and Barcelona, where the 
optimisation of the urban bus system was estimated to reduce GHG 
emissions by 50% (Griswold et al. 2017). For every 1% increase in 
investment in transit services and transit-oriented design, there is 
an estimated 0.16% reduction in private vehicle kilometres travelled 
per capita (McIntosh et al. 2014).
Bike- and car-sharing programmes can reduce GHG emissions 
(medium confidence). Albeit a study of eight cities in the USA with 
larger bike share systems and higher ridership found that their 
potential to reduce total emissions is limited to <0.1% of total GHG 
emissions from the transportation sectors of these cities (Kou et al. 
2020). The emissions reductions effects of car-sharing programmes 
depends on the specifics of programmes: the mode shift from public 
transit to car-sharing services can outweigh the decreases in GHG 
emissions associated with a  reduced number of cars on the road 
(Jung and Koo 2018), whereas car-sharing programmes with EV 
fleets may reduce GHG emissions (Luna et al. 2020).2.8.4 Emission Impacts of Other Related Policies
Policies other than those intended directly to mitigate GHGs can 
also influence these emissions. Policies to protect the stratospheric 
ozone layer is a  case in point. Implementing the Montreal 
Protocol and its amendments, emissions of controlled ozone-
depleting substances (ODSs) (those covered by the protocol) 
declined to a very low level of about 1.4 GtCO 2-eq yr –1 by 2010, 
avoiding GHG emissions of an estimated 13.3–16.7 GtCO 2-eq yr –1 
(9.7–12.5 GtCO 2-eq yr –1 when accounting for the ozone depletion 
and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) offsets) (Velders et  al. 2007). Yet 
fluorinated gases (F-gases), the substances introduced to substitute 
ODSs are also potent GHGs. See Section 2.2 for emissions data, and 
Chapter 13 on current policies to mitigate HFCs and other F-gases. 
GHG implications of two other categories of non-climate policies 
are briefly assessed in this section.
2.8.4.1 Co-impacts of Air Quality, Sector-specific 
and Energy Policies on Climate Mitigation
Co-impacts of local or regional air pollution abatement policies for 
climate mitigation are widely studied in the literature. Cross-border 
externalities of air pollution have also made these a focus of several 
international agreements (Mitchell et  al. 2020). Evaluating the 
effectiveness of such treaties and policies is difficult because deriving 
causal inferences and accurate attribution requires accounting 
for several confounding factors, and direct and indirect spillovers 
(Isaksen 2020). Nevertheless, several studies assess the effectiveness 
of such treaties and regulations (De Foy et al. 2016; Li et al. 2017a, 
2017b; Morgenstern 2018; Mardones and Cornejo 2020). However, 
there is little ex-post empirical analysis and a  greater focus on 
ex-ante studies in the literature.
At a  local scale, air pollutants are often co-emitted with GHGs in 
combustion processes. Many air quality policies and regulations focus 
on local pollution from specific sources that can potentially either 
substitute or complement global GHG emissions in production and 
generation processes. Also, policies that reduce certain air pollutants, 
such as sulphur dioxide (SO 2), have a  positive radiative forcing 
effect (Navarro et al. 2016). The evidence on individual air pollution 
control regulation and policies for GHG emissions is therefore mixed 
(medium evidence, medium agreement). Evidence from the USA 
suggests that increased stringency of local pollution regulation had 
no statistically detectable co-benefits or costs on GHG emissions 
(Brunel and Johnson 2019). Evidence from China suggests that the 
effectiveness of policies addressing local point sources differed from 
those of non-point sources and the co-benefits for climate are mixed, 
though policies addressing large industrial point sources have been 
easier to implement and have had significant impact (Huang and 
Wang 2016; Xu et al. 2016; van der A et al. 2017; Dang and Liao 2019; 
Fang et al. 2019; Yu et al. 2019). Legislation to reduce emissions of 
air pollutants in Europe have significantly improved air quality and 
health but have had an unintended warming effect on the climate 
(Turnock et al. 2016).
Often, the realisation of potential co-benefits depends on the 
type of pollutant addressed by the specific policy, and whether 
complementarities between local pollution and global GHG emissions 
are considered in policy design (medium evidence,  high agreement) 
(Rafaj et al. 2014; Li et al. 2017a). Effective environmental regulations 
that also deliver co-benefits for climate mitigation require integrated 
policies (Schmale et  al. 2014; Haines et  al. 2017). Uncoordinated 
policies can have unintended consequences and even increase 
emissions (Holland et al. 2015). Many studies suggest that policies that 
target both local and global environmental benefits simultaneously 
may be more effective (medium evidence,  medium agreement) 
(Klemun et  al. 2020). Furthermore, air pollution policies aimed at 
inducing structural changes – for example, closure of polluting coal 
power plants or reducing motorised miles travelled – are more likely 
to have potential positive spillover effects for climate mitigation, as 
compared to policies incentivising end-of-pipe controls (Wang 2021).
Other policies that typically have potential co-benefits for climate 
mitigation include those specific to certain sectors and are discussed 
in Chapters 5–11. Examples of such policies include those that 
encourage active travel modes, which have been found to have 
ancillary benefits for local air quality, human health, and GHG 
emissions (Fujii et al. 2018). Policies to reduce energy use through 
greater efficiency have also been found to have benefits for air quality 
and the climate (robust evidence, medium agreement) (Tzeiranaki 
et al. 2019; Bertoldi and Mosconi 2020). Important air quality and 
climate co-benefits of renewable or nuclear energy policies have also 
been found (medium evidence, medium agreement) (Lee et al. 2017; 
Apergis et al. 2018; Sovacool and Monyei 2021).
Policies specific to other sectors, such as encouraging green building 
design, can also reduce GHG emissions (Eisenstein et  al. 2017). 
Evidence from several countries also shows that replacing polluting 
solid biomass cooking with cleaner gas-burning or electric alternatives 
have strong co-benefits for health, air quality, and climate change 
(robust evidence,  high agreement) (Anenberg et al. 2017; Singh et al. 
2017; Tao et al. 2018).
2.8.4.2 Climate Impacts of Agricultural, Forestry, 
Land Use, and AFOLU-related Policies
Policies on agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU), and 
AFOLU sector-related policies have had a  long history in many 
developing and developed countries. Co-impacts of these policies 
on the climate have been only marginally studied, although their 
impacts might be quite important because the AFOLU sector is 
responsible for 22% of total GHG emissions (robust evidence, high 
agreement). The results of afforestation policies around the world 
and the contribution to CCS are also important.
Private and governmental policies can have a major impact on the 
climate. Experience indicates that ‘climate proofing’ a policy is likely 
to require some stimulus, resources, and expertise from agencies 
or organisations from outside the country. Stimulus and support 
for adaptation and mitigation can come from the UN system and 
from international development institutions (FAO 2009). These 
findings are also valid for small/organic farmers vis-à-vis large-scale agro-industry. For example, small/medium and environmentally 
concerned farmers in Europe are often asking for more policies 
and regulations, and see it as necessary from a climate perspective, 
and also to maintain competitiveness relative to large agro-industrial 
complexes. Therefore, the need for governmental support for small 
producers in regulations encompasses all AFOLU sectors.
Forestry case: zero deforestation
Forest is generally defined as land spanning more than 0.5 hectares 
with trees higher than 5 metres and a canopy cover of more than 
10%, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ (FAO 1998). 
Zero-deforestation (i.e.,  both gross and net zero deforestation) 
initiatives generate results at multiple levels (Meijer 2014). Efforts 
to achieve zero-deforestation (and consequently emissions) are 
announced by non-governmental organisations (NGOs), companies, 
governments, and other stakeholder groups. NGOs engage through 
their campaigning, but also propose tools and approaches for 
companies (Leijten et al. 2020). The extent to which companies can 
actually monitor actions conducive to zero-deforestation pledges 
depends on their position in the supply chain. Beyond the business 
practices of participating companies, achieving long-term positive 
societal impacts requires upscaling from supply chains towards 
landscapes, with engagement of all stakeholders, and in particular 
small producers. The various success indicators for zero deforestation 
mirror the multiple levels at which such initiatives develop: progress 
towards certification, improved traceability, and legality are apparent 
output measures, whereas direct-area monitoring and site selection 
approaches target the business practices themselves.
Such efforts have led to the development of the High Carbon 
Stock (HCS) approach that combines carbon stock values with the 
protection of HCS areas (including peatlands and riparian zones) and 
areas important for the livelihoods of local communities (Rosoman 
et  al. 2017). Long-term positive impacts, however, will need to be 
assessed with hindsight and focus on national and global statistics. 
Successful initiatives targeting zero deforestation at jurisdictional 
level would also need to improve the enforcement of forest laws and 
regulations (EII 2015; Meyer and Miller 2015).
Large-scale agribusiness, banks, and consumer goods companies 
dominate supply chain-focused zero-deforestation initiatives, but 
only the producers, including local communities and smallholders, can 
change the production circumstances (TFD 2014). Producers shoulder 
much of the burden for meeting environmental requirements of 
pledges. And local communities and small producers are vulnerable 
to being cut out when supply chains reorient. The zero-deforestation 
pledges do not always devise programmes for introducing new 
sourcing strategies, and governments may have an important 
contribution to make, particularly in safeguarding the interests of 
small producers.
Other than in Brazil and Indonesia, beyond individual supply chains, 
there is still little evidence on positive results of zero-deforestation 
commitments, as information available for companies to judge 
their progress is scarce. Moreover, many zero-deforestation pledges 
set targets to be achieved by 2020 or 2030, and, consequently, 
many companies have not yet reported publicly on their progress. 
Similarly, only a  few governments have yet shown progress in 
reducing deforestation, but the New York Declaration on Forests, 
the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement 
were adopted relatively recently. The effectiveness of private-sector 
zero-deforestation pledges depends on the extent to which they 
can be supported by governmental action and foster a cooperative 
environment with the engagement of all stakeholders. Where the 
pledges are coordinated with regulation, multi-stakeholder dialogues, 
and technical and financial support, a true paradigm shift becomes 
possible. Many governments are still building the capacity to improve 
overall forest governance, but implementing ambitious international 
targets is likely to depend on technical and major financial support 
that has not yet been mobilised.
2.9 Knowledge Gaps
• Global GHG emissions estimates are published less frequently 
and with greater reporting lags than, for example, CO 2 from fossil 
fuel and industry. Data quality and reporting frequency remains 
an issue, particularly in developing countries where the statistical 
infrastructure is not well developed. Efforts to compile a global 
GHG emissions inventory by country, sector, and across time, 
that is annually updated based on the best-available inventory 
information, similar to ongoing activities for carbon dioxide 
(CO 2), methane (CH 4) or nitrous oxide (N 2O), could fill this 
gap. Uncertainties and their methodological treatment in GHG 
emissions estimates are still not comprehensively understood.
• There is a more fundamental data gap for F-gas emissions, where 
data quality in global inventories is poor due to considerable 
gaps in the underlying activity data – particularly in developing 
countries. Comprehensive tracking of fluorinated gases (F-gas) 
emissions would also imply the inclusion of other gases not 
covered under the Paris Agreement, such as chlorofluorocarbons, 
hydrochlorofluorocarbons and others.
• Currently, despite advances in terms of data availability, sectoral 
and spatial resolution, the results in consumption-based emission 
estimates are dependent on the database used, the level of 
sectoral aggregation and country resolution. More fine-grained 
data at spatial resolution as well as the product level would 
support exploring the mitigation options at the sub-national 
level, companies and households.
• Consumption-based emission accounts suffer from lack of 
quantification of uncertainties at the subnational level and 
especially in data-scarce environments, such as for developing 
countries. A better understanding of drivers that caused decoupling 
of emissions at the national and especially sub-national level are 
important to explore.
• Understanding how socio-economic drivers modulate emission 
mitigation is crucial. Technological improvements (e.g., improved 
energy or land-use intensity of the economy) have shown 
a persistent pattern over the last few decades, but gains have been 
outpaced by increases in affluence (GDP per capita) and population 
growth, leading to continued emissions growth. Therefore the 
key gap in knowledge is how these drivers of emissions can be 
mitigated by demand management, alternative economic models, population control and rapid technological transition to different 
extents and in different settings. More research on decoupling 
and sustainability transformations would help to answer these 
questions. Key knowledge gaps also remain in the role of trade – in 
particular, how supporting low-carbon technologies in developing 
and exporting countries can counteract the upward-driving effect 
of trade, and how to achieve decoupling without outsourcing 
emissions to others and often to less developed regions.
• Understanding of how inequality affects emissions is in a nascent 
stage. Less is known about the causal mechanisms by which different 
dimensions of inequality – such as income, socio-economic, spatial, 
socio-cultural-gender and ethnicity – affect emissions. In particular, 
limited knowledge exists on the linkages between dimensions 
of inequality other than income or wealth and emissions arising 
from different service demands. Research gaps are apparent on 
how inequalities in living standards relate to emissions and how 
changes in inequalities between genders, social groups, and other 
marginalised communities impact emissions trends.
• Digitalisation of the economy is often quoted as providing new 
mitigation opportunities, but knowledge and evidences are yet 
limited – such as understanding of the role of smart apps and the 
potential and influence of disruptive technologies at the demand 
and supply side on GHG emissions.
• Despite growing evidence of technological progress across 
a variety of mitigation areas and the availability of increasingly 
precise datasets, knowledge gaps remain on technological 
change and innovation and evidence on speed of transitions 
to clarify what would make them fast or slow. Innovation is an 
inherently uncertain process and there will always be imperfect 
ex ante knowledge on technological outcomes and their effects 
on mitigation. The extent to which a low-carbon transition can 
proceed faster than historical examples is crucial to aid future 
mitigation. That depends on a better understanding of the speed 
of building, updating and replacing infrastructure. Additionally, 
how and whether financing for low-carbon technology 
investment in low- and middle-income countries can be delivered 
at low-cost and sustained over time are important questions. The 
emerging findings that small-scale technologies learn faster and 
are adopted more quickly need to be tested against a broader set 
of cases, and in particular against the large dispersion in data.
• Future CO2 emissions from existing and planned infrastructure is not 
well understood and quantified outside the power sector. Further 
integration of bottom-up accounting and scenario approaches 
from integrated assessment seems promising. Comprehensive 
assessments of hard-to-abate residual fossil fuel emissions and 
their relationship to CO 2 removal activities are lacking, but will be 
important for informing net-zero emissions strategies.
• Empirical evidence of emission impacts from climate policies, 
including carbon pricing, is not sufficient for unambiguous 
attribution assessment, mainly due to the limited experience 
with climate-related policy experiments to date. More attention 
to the methodology for comprehensive evaluation of climate 
policies and measures, such as effective carbon rates is apparent. 
Key knowledge gaps also exist on ex-post evaluations of climate 
and non-climate policies and measures for their impact on 
emissions, particularly at the global scale, considering national 
circumstances and priorities.
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
FAQ 2.1 |  Are emissions still increasing or are they falling?
Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions continued to rise and reached 59 ± 6.6 GtCO 2-eq in 2019, although the rate of growth 
has fallen compared to the previous decade. However, emissions were higher than at any point in human history before. Emissions 
were around 12% and 54% higher than in 2010 and 1990, respectively. Average annual GHG emissions for 2009–2019 were higher 
compared to the periods 2000–2009 and 1990–1999, respectively. GHG emissions growth slowed since 2010: while average annual 
GHG emissions growth was 2.1% for 2000–2010, it was only 1.3% for 2010–2019. In order to stop the temperature increase, 
however, net emissions must be zero.
FAQ 2.2 |   Are there countries that have reduced emissions and grown economically  
at the same time?
About 24 countries have reduced territorial CO 2 and GHG emissions for more than 10 years. Uncertainties in emission levels and 
changes over time prevent a precise assessment in some country cases. In the short observation period of 2010–2015, 43 out of 

these countries experienced GDP growth while their emissions have stabilised or declined. A group of developed countries, such as 
some EU countries and the USA, and some developing countries, such as Cuba, have successfully achieved an absolute decoupling 
of consumption-based CO 2 emissions and GDP growth. Decoupling has been achieved at various levels of per capita income and 
per capita emissions. Overall, the absolute reduction in annual emissions achieved by some countries has been outweighed by 
growth in emissions elsewhere in the world.
FAQ 2.3 |   How much time do we have to act to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees?
If global CO 2 emissions continue at current rates, the remaining carbon budget for keeping warming to 1.5°C will likely be 
exhausted before 2030. Between 1850 and 2019, total cumulative CO 2 emissions from the fossil fuel industry (FFI) and agriculture, 
forestry, and other land use (AFOLU) were 2400 (±240 GtCO 2). Of these, about 410 ± 30 GtCO 2 were added since 2010. This is 
about the same size as the remaining carbon budget for keeping global warming to 1.5°C and between one-third and one-half 
of the 1150 ± 220 (1350, 1700) GtCO 2 for limiting global warming below 2°C with a 67% (50%, 33%) probability, respectively 
(Canadell et al. 2021). At current (2019) rates of emissions, it would only take 8 (2–15) and 25 (18–35) years to emit the equivalent 
amount of CO 2 for a 67th percentile 1.5°C and 2°C remaining carbon budget, respectively. This highlights the dependence of 1.5°C 
pathways on the availability of substantial CO 2 removal capacities, as discussed in Chapters 3, 4, and 12, but also Section 2.7 of 
this chapter.

1990–2019: Dataset Description
This section provides a brief description of the dataset on historic 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compiled for AR6 WGIII (the 
contribution of Working Group III to the IPCC Sixth Assessment 
Report) on climate change mitigation. The dataset is publicly 
available (https://zenodo.org/record/5566761) and has undergone 
additional peer review (Minx et  al. 2021). Sections 2.SM.1 and 
2.SM.2 included in this Supplementary Material are taken (in most 
parts) directly from Minx et al. (2021). It is included here solely to 
provide full transparency over the data used in this report and enable 
easy access to all information.
2.SM.1.1 Overview
The historic emissions dataset used in Chapter  2 provides 
a  comprehensive, synthetic set of estimates for global GHG 
emissions disaggregated by 27 economic sectors and 228 countries 
and territories. Its focus is on anthropogenic GHG emissions: 
natural sources and sinks are not included. Five groups of gases 
are distinguished: (i) CO 2  emissions from fossil fuel combustion 
and industry (CO 2-FFI); (ii) CO 2 emissions from land use, land-use 
change and forestry (CO 2-LULUCF); (iii) methane emissions (CH 4); 
(iv) nitrous oxide emissions (N 2O); (v) fluorinated gases (F-gases) 
comprising hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), 
sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6) as well as nitrogen trifluoride (NF 3). 
Other F-gases that are internationally regulated as ozone-depleting 
substances under the Montreal Protocol such as chlorofluorocarbons 
(CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are not included. GHG 
emissions data are analysed both in native units (except F-gases) as 
well as in CO 2-equivalents (CO 2-eq) as commonly done in wide parts 
of the climate change mitigation community using global warming 
potential with a 100-year time horizon (GWP100) from AR6 (Forster 
et al. 2021). The impact of using alternative metric choices in tracking 
aggregated GHG emissions is discussed in Section  2.SM.3 of this 
Supplementary Material. 
The dataset is compiled from four sources: (i) the full EDGARv6.0 
release for CO 2-FFI as well as non-CO 2 GHGs covering the time period 
1970–2018 (Crippa et al. 2021); (ii) EDGARv6.0 fast-track data for 
CO2-FFI providing preliminary estimates for 2019 and 2020 (Crippa 
et al. 2021); (iii) CO 2-LULUCF as the average of three bookkeeping 
models, consistent with the approach of the global carbon project 
(Friedlingstein et al. 2020); and (iv) 2019 non-CO 2 emissions based 
on Olivier and Peters (2018). The resulting synthetic dataset as 
presented here has undergone additional peer review (Minx et  al. 
2021).
As shown in Table 2.SM.1, sectoral detail is organised along five major 
economic sectors harmonised with the sector chapters used in this report: 
energy supply (Chapter 6); building (Chapter 9); transport (Chapter 10); 
Industry (Chapter 11); and Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) 
(Chapter 7). A further classification for assigning our 228 countries and 
territories to regions is used, combining the standard Annex I/non-Annex I 
distinction with geographical location, as documented in Annex II of this report. The dataset including the sector and region classification, and 
GWP100 by gas can be found at https://zenodo.org/record/5566761.
While there is a growing number of global emissions inventories, 
only a few of them provide a wide coverage of gases, sectors, 
activities, and countries or regions that are sufficiently up to date 
to comprehensively track progress and thereby aid discussions in 
science and policy. Table  2.SM.2 provides an overview of global 
emission inventories. Many inventories focus on individual gases 
and subsets of activities. Few provide sectoral detail and, particularly 
for non-CO 2 GHG emissions, there is often a considerable time-lag 
in reporting. GHG emissions reporting under the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) provides 
reliable, comprehensive and up-to-date statistics for Annex I 
countries across all major GHGs. Non-Annex I countries – except 
least-developed countries and small island states for which this is 
not mandatory – provide GHG emissions inventory information 
through biennial update reports (BURs), but with much less stringent 
reporting requirements in terms of sector, gas and time coverage 
(Gütschow et al. 2016; Deng et al. 2021). As a result, many still lack 
a well-developed statistical infrastructure to provide detailed and 
timely reports (Janssens-Maenhout et al. 2019).Chapter 2 Supplementary Material Emissions Trends and Drivers2SM

Note that EDGARv6.0 distinguishes biogenic CO 2 and CH 4 sources with a ‘bio’ label, with all other sectors ‘fossil’ by default, even if that source is not related to fossil fuel 
activities. The fossil/bio label is hence not descriptive in nature. Two HCFC gases (denoted with *) are included in the dataset, despite being neither PFCs nor HFCs (and hence 
regulated under Montreal). This is to preserve consistency with current and previous versions of EDGAR, which include these gases. Their total warming effect is low (about

2SM2SM-72.SM.1.2 The Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric 
Research (EDGAR)
EDGAR emission estimates included in Chapter 2 emissions dataset 
are derived from the full version 6 release (Crippa et al. 2021). This 
includes CO 2 and non-CO 2 GHG emission estimates from 1970 to 

estimates of fossil CO 2 emissions up to the year 2020. The following 
general EDGAR methodological description is largely taken from 
Janssens-Maenhout et  al. (2019). EDGAR bottom-up emission 
inventory estimates are calculated from international activity data 
and emission factors following the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National 
Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC 2006) – updated according to the 
latest scientific knowledge. Emissions (EMs) from a given sector i in a 
country C accumulated during a year t for a chemical compound x are 
calculated with the country-specific activity data (AD), quantifying 
the activity in sector i, with the mix of j technologies (TECH) and 
with the mix of k (end-of-pipe) abatement measures (EOP) installed 
with the share k for each technology j, the emission rate with an 
uncontrolled emission factor (EF) for each sector i and technology j 
and relative reduction (RED) by abatement measure k, as summarised 
in the following formula:
Equation 2.SM.1
The activity data are sector dependent and vary from fuel combustion 
in energy units of a particular fuel type, to the amount of products 
manufactured, or to the number of animals or the area or yield of 
cultivated crops. The technology mixes, (uncontrolled) emission 
factors and end-of-pipe measures are determined at different levels: 
country-specific, regional, country group (e.g., Annex I/non-Annex I), 
or global. Technology-specific emission factors are used to enable 
an IPCC Tier-2 approach (see Box 2.SM.1), taking into account the 
different management and technology processes or infrastructures 
(e.g., different distribution networks) under specific ‘technologies’, 
and modelling explicitly abatements/ emission reductions – for 
example, the CH 4 recovery from coal mine gas at country level under 
the ‘end-of-pipe measures’. As with national inventories, emissions 
are accounted over a period of one calendar year in the country or territory in which they took place (i.e., a territorial accounting 
principle) (IPCC 2006, 2019). A more complete description of the 
data sources and methodology for EDGARv6 is provided in Crippa 
et al. (2021).
To compute emissions up to the most recent years, a fast-track 
methodology is applied, as described in Oreggioni et  al. (2021). 
The underlying principle is to extrapolate trends based on observed 
activity patterns in representative sectors. For CO 2-FFI emissions, 
the fast track estimates were based on the latest BP coal, oil and 
natural gas consumption data (BP 2021). Emission updates for 
cement, lime, ammonia and ferroalloys production beyond 2018 are 
based on stable statistics. In particular these include US Geological 
Survey statistics, urea production and consumption statistics from 
the International Fertilizer Association, gas flaring statistics from the 
Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership, steel production statistics 
from the World Steel Association, and cement clinker production 
statistics from UNFCCC data. Fast-track extensions for non-CO 2 GHG 
emissions are based on Olivier and Peters (2018). For CH 4 and N 2O 
these are based on agricultural statistics from the UN’s Food and 
Agricultural Organization (FAO) (CH 4 and N 2O), fuel production and 
transmission statistics from the International Energy Agency (IEA) 
and BP (CH 4) as well as data from national GHG inventory reports 
on coal production (CH 4 recovery) and the production of chemicals 
(N2O abatement) submitted by Annex-I countries to the UNFCCC 
following a common reporting format (CRF) (e.g., UNFCCC 2021). 
For F-gases the fast-track extension was based on the most recent 
national emission inventories, submitted under the UNFCCC (up to 
2018). Given the absence of international statistics, for all remaining 
countries and years, a simple extrapolation was used, with fast-track 
data by Olivier and Peters (2020). Here the procedure was to calculate 
the country- and sector-specific emissions growth between 2018 and 

with the 2018 values in the Chapter 2 emissions data. 
2.SM.1.3 Accounting for CO 2 Emissions Land Use, 
Land-use Change and Forestry (CO 2-LULUCF)
All fluxes of CO 2-LULUCF are considered. This includes CO 2 fluxes 
from the clearing of forests and other natural vegetation (by 
anthropogenic fire and/or clear-cut), afforestation, harvest activities, 
land-use related forest degradation, shifting cultivation (cycles of 
Box 2.SM.1 | Methodological Standards for Compiling Greenhouse Gas Inventories According 
to IPCC Guidelines
The 2006 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and their 2019 refinements by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC) provide methodological guidance for compiling greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventories at different levels of 
sophistication (IPCC 2006, 2019). The levels of methodological complexity for estimating GHG emissions and removals are organised 
according to different tiers. Tier 1 is the most basic method. It applies a simple default methodology as well as default emission factors 
and other parameters defined in the IPCC Guidelines. Tier 2 methods replace those default values by country-specific data and can 
use more detailed calculations and activity data. Tier 3 refers to methods that may apply country-specific equations for calculating 
emissions along with more details regarding activity data, technologies and practices, providing the most granular approach to 
estimation. Tier 2 and Tier 3 are also referred to as higher tier methods and are generally considered to be more accurate than a Tier 1 
method, especially when it comes to reporting changes in emissions over time (IPCC 2006).Chapter 2 Supplementary Material Emissions Trends and Drivers2SM
2SM-8forest clearing for agriculture, then abandonment), and regrowth 
of forests and other natural vegetation following wood harvest or 
abandonment of agriculture, and emissions from peat burning and 
drainage. Some of these activities lead to emissions of CO 2 to the 
atmosphere, while others lead to CO 2 sinks. CO 2-LULUCF therefore 
is the net sum of emissions and removals from all human-induced 
land-use changes and land management. Note that CO 2-LULUCF is 
referred to as (net) land-use change emissions, E LUC, in the context 
of the global carbon budget (Friedlingstein et al. 2020). Agriculture 
per se, apart from conversions between different agricultural types, 
does not lead to substantial CO 2 emissions as compared to land-use 
changes such as clearing or regrowth of natural vegetation. Therefore, 
CO2 fluxes in the AFOLU sector refer almost exclusively to forestry 
and other land use (changes), while the agricultural part of the sector 
is mainly characterised by CH 4 and N 2O fluxes.
Since in reality anthropogenic CO 2-LULUCF emissions co-occur with 
natural CO 2 fluxes in the terrestrial biosphere, models have to be used 
to distinguish anthropogenic and natural fluxes (Friedlingstein et al. 
2020). CO 2-LULUCF as reported here is calculated via a bookkeeping 
approach, as originally proposed by Houghton et  al. (2003), 
tracking carbon stored in vegetation and soils before and after 
land-use change. Response curves are derived from the literature 
and observations to describe the temporal evolution of the  decay 
and regrowth of vegetation and soil carbon pools for different 
ecosystems and land-use transitions, including product pools of 
different lifetimes. These dynamics distinguish bookkeeping models 
from the common approach of estimating ‘committed emissions’ 
(assigning all present and future emissions to the time of the land-
use change event), which is frequently derived from remotely-sensed 
land-use area or biomass observations (Ramankutty et  al. 2007). 
Most bookkeeping models also represent the long-term degradation 
of primary forest as the reduction of standing vegetation and soil 
carbon stocks in secondary forests, and include forest management 
practices such as wood harvesting. Since the effects of environmental 
changes are excluded by the bookkeeping approach, bookkeeping 
CO2-LULUCF emissions estimates isolate the effects of anthropogenic 
(land-use-related) drivers.
The definition of CO 2-LULUCF emissions by global carbon cycle 
models, as used here and in Canadell et al. (2021), differs from IPCC 
definitions (IPCC 2006) applied in national greenhouse gas inventories 
(NGHGI) for reporting under the climate convention (Grassi et  al. 
2018) and, similarly, from FAO estimates of carbon fluxes on forest 
land (Tubiello et al. 2021). This means that NGHGI data include natural 
terrestrial fluxes caused by changes in environmental conditions, 
such as the effects of rising atmospheric CO 2 (CO 2-fertilisation), 
climate change, and nitrogen deposition – sometimes called ‘indirect 
effects’ as opposed to the direct anthropogenic effects of land-use 
change and management (Houghton et  al. 2012) (Section  2.2.2.1 
and Chapter 7) – through adoption of the IPCC so-called land-use 
proxy approach when they occur on areas that countries declare 
as managed. Since environmental changes turned the terrestrial 
biosphere into a massive sink, removing about one-third of annual 
anthropogenic emissions in the last decade (Friedlingstein et  al. 
2020), it is unsurprising that global emission estimates are smaller 
based on NGHGI than for global models’ definitions (Figure 2.SM.1). About 3.2 GtCO 2 yr−1 (for the period 2005–2014) was found to be 
explicable by these conceptual differences in anthropogenic forest 
sink estimation related to the representation of environmental change 
impacts and the areas considered as managed (Grassi et al. 2018). 
These two conceptually different approaches have different aims: 
the global models’ approach separates natural from anthropogenic 
drivers – that is, the effects of changes in environmental conditions 
from effects of land-use change and land management. By contrast, 
the NGHGI approach separates fluxes based on areas, with all those 
occurring on managed land being declared anthropogenic. Given that 
observational data of carbon stocks or fluxes cannot distinguish the 
co-occurring effects of environmental changes and land-use activities, 
an area-based approach that does not require this distinction can 
more consistently be implemented across countries. These conceptual 
differences between global models and NGHGI approaches have 
been acknowledged (Petrescu et al. 2020a; Canadell et al. 2021) and 
approaches have been developed to map the two definitions to each 
other (Grassi et al. 2018, 2021). For non-CO 2 GHGs, drivers and areas 
coincide, such that FAOSTAT data for CH 4 and N 2O is complementary 
to bookkeeping CO 2-LULUCF emissions.
Following the approach taken by the global carbon budget 
(Friedlingstein et  al. 2020), the approach taken here is to use the 
average of estimates from three bookkeeping models: Bookkeeping 
of land-use emissions (BLUE) (Hansis et al. 2015), H&N (Houghton 
and Nassikas, 2017), and an earth system compact model (OSCAR) 
(Gasser et al. 2020). Key differences across these estimates, including 
land-use forcing, are summarised in Table 2.SM.4. Since bookkeeping 
models do not include emissions from organic soils, emissions from 
peat fires and peat drainage are added from external datasets: Peat 
burning is based on the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFEDv4) 
(van der Werf et al. 2017) and introduces large interannual variability 
to the CO 2-LULUCF emissions due to synergies of land-use and 
climate variability, particularly in Southeast Asia, strongly noticeable 
during El Niño events such as in 1997. Peat drainage is based on 
estimates by Hooijer et  al. (2010) for Indonesia and Malaysia in 
H&N, and added to BLUE and OSCAR from the global FAO data on 
organic soils emissions from croplands and grasslands (Conchedda 
and Tubiello 2020). 
2.SM.2 Uncertainties in GHG Emissions 
Estimates
Estimates of historic GHG emissions – CO 2, CH 4, N2O and F-gases 
(HFCs, PFCs, SF 6, NF 3) – are uncertain to different degrees. Assessing 
and reporting uncertainties is crucial in order to understand whether 
available estimates are sufficiently accurate to answer – for example, 
whether GHG emissions are still rising, or if a country has achieved 
an emissions-reduction goal (Marland 2008). These uncertainties can 
be of a scientific nature, such as when a process is not sufficiently 
understood. They also arise from incomplete or unknown parameter 
information (activity data, emission factors, and so on), as well as 
estimation uncertainties from imperfect modelling techniques. There 
are at least three major ways to examine uncertainties in emission 
estimates (Marland et  al. 2009): (i) by comparing estimates made Emissions Trends and Drivers Chapter 2 Supplementary Material

2SM-10by independent methods and observations (e.g., comparing top-
down vs bottom-up estimates; modelling against remote sensing 
data) (Li et al. 2020; Saunois et al. 2020; Petrescu et al. 2020a, 2021); 
(ii) by comparing estimates from multiple sources and understanding 
sources of variation (Macknick, 2011; Andres et  al. 2012; Andrew 
2020; Ciais et al. 2021); (iii) by evaluating multiple estimates from 
a single source (Hoesly and Smith 2018) including approaches such 
as uncertainty ranges estimated through statistical sampling across 
parameter values applied, for example, at the country or sectoral 
level (Monni et al. 2007; Andres et al. 2014; Solazzo et al. 2021), or to 
spatially distributed emissions (Tian et al. 2019).
Uncertainty estimates can be rather different depending on the 
method chosen. For example, the range of estimates from multiple 
sources is bounded by their interdependency; they can be lower 
than true structural plus parameter uncertainty estimates or than 
estimates made by independent methods. In particular, it is important 
to account for potential bias in estimates, which can result from 
using common methodological or parameter assumptions across 
estimates, or from missing sources, which can result in a systemic 
bias in emission estimates (see N 2O discussion below). Independent 
top-down observational constraints are, therefore, particularly useful 
to bound total emission estimates (Petrescu et al. 2021).
Solazzo et al. (2021) evaluated the uncertainty of EDGAR’s source 
categories and totals for the main GHGs (CO 2-FFI, CH 4, N2O). This 
study is based on the propagation of the uncertainty associated with 
input parameters (activity data and emission factors) as estimated 
by expert judgement (Tier-1) and compiled by the IPCC (2019, 2006). 
A key methodological challenge is determining how well uncertain 
parameters are correlated between sectors, countries, and regions. 
The more highly correlated parameters (e.g., emission factors) are 
across scales, the higher the resulting overall uncertainty estimate. 
Solazzo et  al. (2021) assume full covariance between the same 
source categories where similar assumptions are being used, and 
independence otherwise. For example, they assume full covariance 
where the same emission factor is used between countries or sectors, 
while assuming independence where country-specific emission 
factors are used. This strikes a balance between extreme assumptions 
(full independence or full covariance in all cases) that are likely 
unrealistic, but still leans towards higher uncertainty estimates. 
When aggregating emission sources, assuming full covariance increases the resulting uncertainty estimate. Uncertainties calculated 
with this methodology tend to be higher than the range of values 
from ensemble of dependent inventories (Saunois et al. 2016, 2020). 
The uncertainty of emission estimates derived from ensembles of 
gridded results from bio-physical models (Tian et  al. 2018) adds 
an additional dimension of spatial variability, and is therefore not 
directly comparable with aggregate country or regional uncertainty, 
estimated with the methods discussed above.
This section provides an assessment of uncertainties in GHG emissions 
data at the global level. The uncertainties reported here combine 
statistical analysis, comparisons of global emissions inventories and 
expert judgement of the likelihood of results lying outside a defined 
confidence interval, rooted in an understanding gained from the 
relevant literature. At times, we also use a qualitative assessment 
of confidence levels to characterise the annual estimates from each 
term, based on the type, amount, quality, and consistency of the 
evidence as defined by the IPCC (IPCC 2014). 
Such a comprehensive uncertainty assessment covering all major 
groups of GHGs and considering multiple lines of evidence has 
been missing in the literature. The absence has provided a serious 
challenge for a transparent, scientific reporting of GHG emissions 
in climate change assessments such as those by IPCC’s Working 
Group  III or the UN Emissions Gap Report, which have only more 
recently started to deal with the issue (Blanco et  al. 2014; UNEP 
2020). Most of the available studies in the peer-reviewed literature 
using multiple lines of evidence for their assessment have focused on 
individual gases as in the Global Carbon Budget (Friedlingstein et al. 
2020), the Global Methane Budget (Saunois et al. 2020) or the Global 
Nitrous Oxide Budget (Tian et al. 2020) or covered multiple gases, but 
mainly considered individual lines of evidence (Janssens-Maenhout 
et al. 2019; Solazzo et al. 2021).
We adopt a 90% confidence interval (5th–95th percentile) to report 
the uncertainties in our GHG emissions estimates – that is, there is 
a 90% likelihood that the true value will be within the provided range 
if the errors have a Gaussian distribution, and no bias is assumed. 
This is in line with previous reporting in IPCC AR5 (Blanco et  al. 
2014; Ciais et  al. 2014). Note that national emissions inventories 
submitted to the UNFCCC are requested to report uncertainty using 
a 95% or 2σ confidence interval. The use of this broader uncertainty Figure  2.SM.1 (continued): Estimates of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions from different data sources 1970–2019.  Top-left panel:

2SM2SM-11interval implies, however, a relatively high degree of knowledge 
about the uncertainty structure of the associated data, particularly 
regarding the distribution of uncertainty in the tails of the probability 
distributions. Such a high degree of knowledge is not present across 
all regions, emission sectors, and species considered here. Note 
that, in some cases below, we convert 1σ uncertainty results from 
the literature to a 90% confidence interval by implicitly assuming 
a normal distribution. While we do this as a necessary assumption 
to obtain a consistent estimate across all GHGs, we note that this 
itself is an assumption that may not be valid. We have made use of 
the best available information in the literature, but note that much 
more work on uncertainty quantification remains to be done. Using 
IPCC uncertainty language, we cannot assign high confidence to the 
robustness of most existing uncertainty estimates.
2.SM.2.1 CO2 Emissions from Fossil Fuels and Industrial 
Processes (CO 2-FFI)
Several studies have compared estimates of annual CO 2-FFI emissions 
from different global inventories (Macknick 2011; Andres et al. 2012; 
Gütschow et al. 2016; Janssens-Maenhout et al. 2019; Andrew, 2020; 
Petrescu et al. 2020b). However, estimates are not fully independent 
as they all ultimately rely on many of the same data sources. For 
example, all global inventories use one of four global energy datasets 
to estimate CO 2 emissions from energy use, and these energy 
datasets themselves all rely on the same national energy statistics, 
with few exceptions (Andrew 2020). Some divergence between these 
estimates (Figure 2.SM.2) are related to differences in the estimation 
methodology, conversion factors, emission coefficients, assumptions 
about combustion efficiency, and calculation errors (Marland et al. 
2009; Andrew 2020). Key differences for nine global datasets are 
highlighted in Table  2.SM.3 (see also Table  2.SM.2 for further 
information on the inventories). Another important source of divergence between datasets is 
differences in their respective system boundaries (Macknick 2011; 
Andres et al. 2012; Andrew 2020). Hence, differences across CO 2-FFI 
emissions estimates do not reflect full uncertainty due to source data 
dependencies. At the same time, the observed range across estimates 
from different databases exaggerates uncertainty, to the extent that 
they largely originate in system boundary differences (Macknick 
2011; Andrew 2020).
Across global inventories, mean global annual CO 2-FFI emissions 
track at 34 ± 2  GtCO 2 in 2014, reflecting a variability of about 
±5.4% (Figure  2.SM.1). However, this variability is almost halved 
when system boundaries are harmonised (Andrew 2020). EDGAR 
CO2-FFI emissions, as used there, track at the top of the range as 
shown in Figure  2.SM.1. This is partly due to the comprehensive 
system boundaries of EDGAR, but also due to the assumption of 
100% oxidation of combusted fuels as per IPCC default assumptions. 
Once system boundaries are harmonised, EDGAR continues to track 
at the upper end of the range, but no longer at the top. EDGAR 
CO2-FFI estimates are further well-aligned with emission inventories 
submitted by Annex I countries to the UNFCCC – even though some 
variation can occur for individual countries (Andrew 2020; Minx et al. 
2021). Differences in FFI-CO 2 emissions across different versions of 
the EDGAR dataset are shown in Figure 2.SM.2.
Uncertainties in CO 2-FFI emissions arise from the combination 
of uncertainty in activity data and uncertainties in emission 
factors including assumptions for combustion completeness and 
non-combustion uses. CO 2-FFI emissions estimates are largely derived 
from energy consumption activity data, where data uncertainties are 
comparatively small due to well-established statistical monitoring 
systems, although there are larger uncertainties in some countries 
and time periods (Macknick 2011; Andres et  al. 2012; Ballantyne 
et  al. 2015; Janssens-Maenhout et  al. 2019; Andrew, 2020). Most Figure 2.SM.2 | Comparison of estimates from different versions of the EDGAR database for CO 2 from fossil fuel combustion and industry.  EDGAR v6.0

Chapter 2 Supplementary Material Emissions Trends and Drivers2SM
2SM-12of the underlying uncertainties are systematic and related to 
underlying biases in the energy statistics and accounting methods 
used (Friedlingstein et  al. 2020). Uncertainties are lower for fuels 
with relatively uniform properties such as natural gas, oil or gasoline, 
and higher for fuels with more diverse properties, such as coal (IPCC 
2006; Blanco et al. 2014). Uncertainties in CO 2 emissions estimates 
from industrial processes – that is, non-combustive oxidation of fossil 
fuels and decomposition of carbonates – are higher than for fossil 
fuel combustion. At the same time, products such as cement also take 
up carbon over their life cycle, which are often not fully considered in 
carbon balances (Xi et al. 2016; Sanjuán et al. 2020; Guo et al. 2021). 
However, recent versions of the global carbon budget include specific 
estimates for the cement carbonation sink and estimate average 
annual CO 2 uptake at 0.70  GtCO 2 for 2010–2019 (Friedlingstein 
et al. 2020).
Uncertainties for energy consumption data (and, therefore, CO 2-FFI 
emissions) are generally higher for the first year of their publication 
when less data is available to constrain estimates. In the BP energy 
statistics, 70% of data points are adjusted by an average of 1.3% 
of a country’s total fossil fuel use in the subsequent year, with 
further more modest revisions later on (Hoesly and Smith 2018). 
Uncertainties are also higher for developing countries, where statistical reporting systems do not have the same level of maturity 
as in many industrialised countries (Gregg et al. 2008; Marland, 2008; 
Andres et al. 2012; Guan et al. 2012; Korsbakken et al. 2016; Janssens-
Maenhout et al. 2019; Friedlingstein et al. 2019, 2020; Andrew, 2020). 
However, these customary country groupings do not always predict 
the extent to which a country’s energy data has undergone historical 
revisions (Hoesly and Smith 2018). Uncertainties in CO 2-FFI emissions 
before the 1970s are higher than for more recent estimates. Over the 
last two to three decades uncertainties have increased again because 
of increased fuel production and consumption in some developing 
countries with less rigorous statistics and more uncertain fuel 
properties (Marland et al. 2009; Ballantyne et al. 2015; Friedlingstein 
et al. 2020).
The global carbon project (Le Quéré et al. 2018; Friedlingstein et al. 
2019, 2020) assesses uncertainties in global anthropogenic CO 2-FFI 
emissions estimates within one standard deviation (1σ) as ±5% 
(±10% at 2σ). This is broadly consistent with the ±8.4% uncertainty 
estimate for CDIAC (Andres et al. 2014) as well as the ±7 to ±9% 
uncertainty estimate for EDGARv4.3.2 and v5 (Janssens-Maenhout 
et al. 2019; Solazzo et al. 2021) at 2σ. It remains at the higher end 
of the ±5% to ±10% range provided by Ballantyne et  al. (2015). 
Consistent with the above uncertainty assessments, we present 
Figure 2.SM.3 | Dependencies of selected global energy and CO 2 emissions datasets.  Here a ‘primary’ emissions dataset is one that calculated emissions directly 
from energy data, rather than collating emissions estimates from other sources. In addition to energy data sources, some emissions datasets include emissions from carbonates,

2.SM.2.2 Anthropogenic CO 2 Emissions from Land use, 
Land-use Change and Forestry (CO 2-LULUCF)
CO2-LULUCF emissions are drawn from three global bookkeeping 
models. For 1990–2019, average net CO 2-LULUCF emissions are 
estimated at 6.1, 4.3, and 5.6  GtCO 2 yr–1 for Bookkeeping of 
land-use emissions (BLUE), Houghton and Nassikas Bookkeeping 
Model (H&N), and an earth system compact model (OSCAR) 
(Friedlingstein et  al. 2020). Gross emissions 1990–2019 for BLUE, 
H&N, OSCAR are 17, 9.6 and 19 GtCO 2 yr–1, while gross removals 
are 11, 5.3, 13  GtCO 2 yr–1, respectively. For 1990–2019 maximum 
average differences are 9.1 and 7.8 GtCO 2 yr–1 for gross emissions 
and removals, respectively (Friedlingstein et  al. 2020). Note that 
2016–2019 is extrapolated in H&N and 2019 in OSCAR based on 
the anomalies of the net flux for the gross fluxes. Differences in 
the models underlying this observed variability are reported in 
Table 2.SM.4. In the longer term, a consistent general upward trend 
since 1850 across models is reversed during the second part of 
the 20th century. Since the 1980s, however, differing trends across 
models are related to, among other things, different land-use forcings 
(Gasser et al. 2020). Further differences between BLUE and H&N can 
be traced in particular to: (i) differences in carbon densities between 
natural and managed vegetation, or between primary and secondary 
vegetation; (ii) a higher allocation of cleared and harvested material 
to fast turnover pools in BLUE compared to H&N; and (iii) to the 
inclusion sub-grid scale transitions (Bastos et al. 2021). Uncertainties in CO 2-LULUCF emissions can be more comprehensively 
assessed through comparisons across a suite of dynamic global 
vegetation models (DGVM) (Friedlingstein et al. 2020). DGVM models 
are not included in the CO 2-LULUCF mean estimate provided here, 
because the typical DGVM setup includes the loss of additional sink 
capacity. The loss of additional sink capacity arises because DGVMs 
isolate LULUCF emissions from natural fluxes caused by historical 
environmental changes by subtracting a counterfactual simulation 
without land-use change from one with land-use change (Pongratz 
et al. 2014). In particular, forests have increased their carbon density 
over time due to CO 2 and other environmental effects beneficial 
for plant growth. The ‘additional sink capacity’ forests would have 
created at the unaltered pre-industrial extent is ‘lost’ through 
land-use change and included in the DGVM estimates of CO 2-LULUCF , 
but excluded in bookkeeping estimates that disregard changes in 
carbon densities in response to environmental changes. The loss of 
additional sink capacity makes up about 40% of the DGVM estimate 
in recent years (Obermeier et al. 2021). 
Nonetheless, a CO 2-LULUCF estimate from the DGVM multi-model 
mean remains consistent with the average estimate from the 
bookkeeping models, as shown in Figure  2.SM.1. Variation across 
DGVMs is large with a standard deviation at around 1.8 GtCO 2 yr–1, 
but is still smaller than the average difference between bookkeeping 
models at 2.6  GtCO 2 yr–1 as well as the current estimate of H&N 
(Houghton and Nassikas 2017) and its previous model versions 
(Houghton et  al. 2012). DGVMs differ in methodology, input data 
and how comprehensively they represent land-use-related processes. 
In particular land management, such as crop harvesting, tillage, or 
grazing (all implicitly included in observation-based carbon densities 
of bookkeeping models) can alter CO 2 flux estimates substantially, 
but are included to varying extents in DGVMs, thus increasing model Table 2.SM.3 | System boundaries and other key features of global FFI-CO 2 emissions datasets.  Comparison of some important general characteristics of nine

2SM-14spread (Arneth et al. 2017). For all types of models, land-use forcing 
is a major determinant of emissions and removals, and its high 
uncertainty impacts CO 2-LULUCF estimates (Bastos et al. 2021). The 
reconstruction of land-use change of the historical past, which has 
to cover decades to centuries of legacy LULUCF fluxes, is based on 
sparse data or proxies (Goldewijk et al. 2017; Hurtt et al. 2020), while 
satellite-based products suffer from complications in distinguishing 
natural from anthropogenic drivers (Hansen et  al. 2013; Li et  al. 
2018) or accounting for small-scale disturbances and degradation 
(Matricardi et  al. 2020). Lastly, regional carbon budgets can be 
substantially over- or under-estimated when the carbon embodied in 
trade products is not accounted for (Ciais et al. 2021).
Friedlingstein et  al. (2020) is taken as the reference point for 
our uncertainty assessment. The Global Carbon Budget provides 
a best-value judgement for the ±1σ absolute uncertainty range of 
CO2-LULUCF emissions at ±2.6  GtCO 2 yr–1, constant over the last 
decades. This constant, absolute uncertainty estimate corresponds 
roughly to a relative uncertainty of about ±50% over 1970–2019, 
which is much higher than for most fossil-fuel related emissions, but 
reflects the large model spread and large differences between the 
current estimate of H&N and its previous model versions (Houghton 
et al. 2012). This corresponds to a relative uncertainty of about ±80% 
for a 90% confidence interval (5th–95th percentile). However, here 
we opt for a slightly lower relative uncertainty estimate of about 
±70% for a 90% confidence interval, given that the mean of the 
CO2-LULUCF estimates has been increasing over the last few decades. 
This provides absolute uncertainty estimates that are consistent in 
magnitude with the constant value in Friedlingstein et  al. (2020) 
over time – slightly lower for earlier years and slightly higher for the 
most recent years. Compared to AR5 this is larger than the ±50% 
uncertainty estimate applied in the assessment, but still in line with 
the upper end of the broader relative uncertainty range considered 
of ±50% to ±75% (Blanco et al. 2014). Finally note that much larger 
uncertainties in CO 2-LULUCF emissions have been identified across 
the literature, but were traced back to different definitions used in various modelling frameworks (Pongratz et al. 2014) as well as 
inventory data (Grassi et al. 2018).
Uncertainties can be much higher at a national level than at global 
level, since regional biases tend to cancel out. Land-use forcing has 
been identified as major driver of differences at regional and global 
level (Gasser et  al. 2020; Hartung et  al. 2021; Rosan et  al. 2021), 
as have assumptions on carbon densities and the allocation of 
cleared or harvested material to slash or product pools of various 
lifetimes, for which accurate global data over long time periods is 
missing (Bastos et al. 2021). Although the bookkeeping models are 
conceptually similar, the bookkeeping estimates include country-
specific information to different extents: for example, fire suppression 
(for the USA) is included in H&N (Houghton and Nassikas 2017), but 
not the other estimates. H&N includes peat drainage emissions only 
for Southeast Asia, while the FAO emissions estimates for organic soil 
drainage added to BLUE and OSCAR cover all countries (Friedlingstein 
et al. 2020). The effect of smoothing the FAO cropland and pasture 
information, which can be very variable in some countries, with 
a five-year running mean in H&N, while the annual data is used for 
the recent decades in History database of the Global Environment 
(HYDE) underlying BLUE and OSCAR, must also be expected to 
contribute to the spread in estimates on a country level. Overall, 
great care has to be taken when comparing estimates of individual 
countries across models so as not to over-interpret differences.
Finally, note that attempts to constrain the estimates of CO 2-LULUCF 
emissions from bookkeeping models and DGVMs by observed 
biomass densities have been undertaken, but were successful only in 
some non-tropical regions (Li et al. 2017). While providing valuable 
independent and observation-driven information, remote-sensing 
derived estimates of carbon stock changes have limited applicability 
for model evaluation for the total CO 2-LULUCF flux, since they 
usually only quantify vegetation biomass changes and exclude legacy 
emissions from the pre-satellite era. Further, with the exception 
of the (pan-tropical) estimates by Baccini et  al. (2012) they either 
track committed instead of actual emissions (Tyukavina et al. 2015), Table 2.SM.4 | Key differences between global bookkeeping estimates for CO 2-LULUCF emissions.

therefore fully distinguishes natural from anthropogenic disturbances 
for actual emissions as the CO 2-LULUCF emissions estimate provided 
here do, based on bookkeeping models and DGVMs, such that 
a direct evaluation is hampered.
2.SM.2.3 Anthropogenic CH 4 Emissions
About 60% of total global methane emissions come from 
anthropogenic sources – that is, they are caused by direct human 
activities since pre-industrial times/pre-agricultural times (Saunois 
et  al. 2020). Some studies suggest larger anthropogenic fossil emissions 
than currently estimated (e.g., Hmiel et  al. 2020). Anthropogenic 
methane emissions cover a range of different sectors: livestock 
(enteric fermentation and manure management, rice cultivation, 
fossil fuel production, distribution and use, waste handling (solid and 
water waste) as well as biomass and biofuel burning. About 90% of 
biomass burning events are thought to be triggered by human action 
(Andreae 1991); as biomass burning contributes less than 5% to 
anthropogenic methane emissions, the misallocations of natural fires 
is likely lower than the overall uncertainty. Methane emissions can be 
derived either using bottom-up estimates that rely on anthropogenic 
inventories such as EDGAR (Janssens-Maenhout et  al. 2019), land 
surface models that infer part of natural emissions (Wania et  al. 
2013) or flux observation-based estimates for some specific sources 
such as geological sources (Etiope et  al. 2019). Alternatively, top-
down approaches can be used, such as atmospheric transport models 
that assimilate methane atmospheric observations to estimate past 
methane emissions (Houweling et  al. 2017). These techniques are 
applied to infer emissions for a specific facility, sector, region or other 
aggregation, based on in-situ or satellite-based observations. Satellite 
observations have greatly improved the coverage of available data to better constrain top-down approaches. Local or regional studies have 
proved important as independent estimate of inventories while being 
spared of the chemical sink uncertainty (Maasakkers et  al. 2021). 
Some top-down systems aim to optimise certain emission sectors 
based on differences in their spatial and temporal distributions 
(Bergamaschi et al. 2013), while others only solve for net emissions 
at the surface. Then the partitioning of top-down posterior (output) 
fluxes between specific source sectors is carried out with various 
degrees of uncertainty, depending of the methods and the degree 
of refinement of sectors, but often rely on ratios from the prior 
knowledge of fluxes. Comprehensive assessments of methane 
sources and sinks have been provided by Saunois et al. (2016, 2020) 
and Kirschke et al. (2013).
EDGAR (Crippa et  al. 2019, 2021; Janssens-Maenhout et  al. 2019) 
is one of multiple global methane bottom-up inventories available. 
Other inventories – namely GAINS (Höglund-Isaksson 2012; Höglund-
Isaksson et al. 2020), US-EPA (EPA 2011, 2021), CEDS (Hoesly et al. 
2018; McDuffie et  al. 2020; O’Rourke et  al. 2020), PRIMAP-hist 
(Gütschow et  al. 2016, 2021b) as well as FAOSTAT-CH 4 (Tubiello 
2013, 2018, 2019; Federici et al. 2015) – can differ in terms of their 
country and sector coverage as well as detail. EDGAR, CEDS, US-EPA 
and GAINS cover all major source sectors (fossil fuels, agriculture and 
waste, biofuel) – except large-scale biomass burning – but this can 
be added from different databases such as FINN (Wiedinmyer et al. 
2011), GFAS (Kaiser et al. 2012), GFED (Giglio et al. 2013) or QFED 
(Darmenov and da Silva 2013). Much like CO 2-FFI, these inventories 
of anthropogenic emissions are not completely independent as they 
either follow the same IPCC methodology to derive emissions, rely 
on similar data sources (e.g., FAOSTAT activity data for agriculture, 
reported fossil fuel production), or draw on reported country 
inventory data (Petrescu et al. 2020a). However, they may differ in the 
assumptions and data used for the calculation, and in the choice of 
IPCC Tier levels for the methodology (Box 2.SM.1). For example, while 
the US-EPA inventory uses the reported emissions by the countries 
Figure 2.SM.4 | Comparison of estimates from different versions of the EDGAR database for anthropogenic CH 4 emissions.  Chapter 2 Supplementary Material Emissions Trends and Drivers2SM
2SM-16to UNFCCC, other inventories produce their own estimates using 
a consistent approach for all countries, and country-specific activity 
data, emission factor and technological abatement when available. 
FAOSTAT and EDGAR mostly apply a Tier 1 approach to estimate CH 4 
emissions while GAINS uses a Tier 2 approach (Box 2.SM.1). CEDS is 
based on pre-existing emission estimates from FAOSTAT and EDGAR, 
which are then scaled to match country-specific inventories, largely 
those reported to UNFCCC.
Global anthropogenic CH 4 emission estimates are compared in 
Figure 2.SM.4. EDGARv5.0 has revised total global CH 4 emissions by 
about 10 MtCH 4 yr–1 compared to the previous version due to a higher 
estimate for the waste sector (Figure 2.SM.1). Subsequent revisions 
of the estimation methodology in EDGARv6 in alignment with the 
IPCC guidelines refinement (IPCC 2019) lead to very substantial 
differences in total CH 4 emissions that are up to 50 MtCH 4yr–1 lower 
before the 1990s compared to previous versions, but differences are 
smaller ranging from 1–13 MtCH 4 yr–1 since the 2000s (Figure 2.SM.1). 
The cause of these differences is a new procedure to separately estimate the venting component for gas and oil in the venting and 
flaring sector (1B2a/b2). Differences across different versions of the 
EDGAR dataset are shown in Figure 2.SM.4. US-EPA show the lowest 
estimates, probably due to missing estimates from a significant 
number of countries not reporting to UNFCCC (US-EPA 2020 includes 
estimates from only 195 countries) and incomplete sectoral coverage. 
EDGARv6 estimates of anthropogenic CH 4 emissions, as used here, 
are in the upper range of the different inventories across most 
anthropogenic sources. However, none of these inventories cover CH 4 
emissions from forest and grassland burning, which amount to about 
10–12 Mt yr–1 globally.
Saunois et  al. (2020) provide estimates of CH 4 sources and sinks 
based on bottom-up and top-down approaches associated with 
an uncertainty range based on the minimum and maximum values 
of available studies (because for many individual source and sink 
estimates the number of studies is often relatively small). Thus, they 
do not consider the uncertainty of the individual estimates. As shown 
in Table 2.SM.5, uncertainties in total global CH 4 emissions across 
Table 2.SM.5 | Uncertainties estimated for CH 4 sources at the global scale: based on ensembles of bottom-up (BU) and top-down (TD) estimates, national 
reports and specific uncertainty assessments of EDGAR.  Note: this table is not intended to be exhaustive, but provides uncertainty estimates from some of the key 
literature based on different methodological approaches. Source: Minx et al. (2021).

* Mainly due to difficulties in attributing emissions to small specific emission sector.Emissions Trends and Drivers Chapter 2 Supplementary Material
2SM2SM-17all anthropogenic and natural sources are comparatively small at 
±6% – a range larger than errors in transport models only (Locatelli 
et al. 2015). However, this uncertainty on total emissions is probably 
underestimated as the uncertainty in the chemical sink was not 
fully considered in the top-down estimates in Saunois et al. (2020). 
About 90% of the chemical sink of methane is due to the oxidation 
by the hydroxyl radical (OH). Uncertainty on the global burden of 
OH is about ±5%, much lower than uncertainties derived from 
detailed analysis using EDGAR data by Janssens-Maenhout (2019) 
and Solazzo et  al. (2021), reaching around ±45% at 2σ. Saunois 
et al. (2020) reported uncertainty of 10–15%, which translates to an 
uncertainty of about ±10% to ±30% depending on the category, with 
larger uncertainty in the fossil fuel sectors than in the agriculture and 
waste sector (Saunois et al. 2020). However, these uncertainties are 
also underestimated as they do not consider the uncertainty in each 
individual estimate, which includes potential uncertainties in activity 
data, emission factors, and equations used to estimate emissions.
Uncertainties in EDGAR CH 4 emissions using a Tier 1 approach are 
estimated at –33% to +46% at 2σ, but there is great variability 
across individual sectors ranging from ±30% (agriculture) to more 
than ±100% (fuel combustion), with high uncertainties in oil and 
gas sector (±93%) and coal fugitive emissions (±65%) (Solazzo et al. 
2021). As an example of developed country with well-established 
emissions reporting, US methane emissions also report large 
uncertainties depending on the sector (NASEM 2018); although the 
activity data uncertainty may be lower than those for less-developed 
countries. For example, global inventories, such as EDGAR, estimate 
uncertainties in national anthropogenic emissions of about ± 32% 
for the 24 member countries of OECD, and up to ±57% for other 
countries, which have more uncertain activity data (Janssens-
Maenhout et al. 2019). 
The 2020 UN emissions gap report (UNEP 2020) gives an uncertainty 
range for global anthropogenic CH 4 emissions with one standard deviation of ±30% (i.e., ±60% for 2σ). On the other hand, IPCC AR5 
provides a comparatively low estimate at ±20% for a 90% confidence 
interval. Overall, we apply a best value judgement of ±30% for global 
anthropogenic CH 4 emissions for a 90% confidence interval. This is 
justified by the larger uncertainties reported in studies on the EDGAR 
dataset (Janssens-Maenhout et al. 2019; Solazzo et al. 2021) as well 
as for FAO activity statistics by Tubiello et al. (2015).
2.SM.2.4 Anthropogenic N 2O Emissions
Anthropogenic nitrous oxide (N 2O) emissions occur in a number 
of sectors, namely agriculture, fossil fuel and industry, biomass 
burning, and waste. The emissions from the agriculture sector have 
four components: (i) direct and indirect emissions from soil and 
water bodies (inland, coastal, and oceanic waters); (ii) manure left 
on pasture; (iii) manure management; and (iv) aquaculture. Besides 
these main sectors, a final ‘other’ category represents the sum of 
the effects of climate, elevated atmospheric CO 2, and land cover 
change. This is a new sector that was developed as part of the global 
N2O budget (Tian et al. 2020) – a recent assessment to quantify all 
sources and sinks of N 2O emissions updating previous work (Mosier 
et al. 1998; Kroeze et al. 1999; Mosier and Kroeze, 2000; Syakila and 
Kroeze, 2011). Estimates from the global N 2O budget are referred 
to as GCP-N 2O since the assessment was facilitated by the Global 
Carbon Project (GCP). Overall, anthropogenic sources contributed 
just over 40% to total global N 2O emissions (Tian et al. 2020).
There are a variety of approaches for estimating N 2O emissions. 
These include inventories (Tubiello et  al. 2013; Tian et  al. 2018; 
Janssens-Maenhout et  al. 2019), statistical extrapolations of flux 
measurements (Wang et  al. 2020a), and process-based land and 
ocean modelling (Tian et al. 2019; Yang et al. 2020). There are at least 
five relevant global N 2O emissions inventories available: EDGAR 
( Crippa et al. 2019, 2021; Janssens-Maenhout et al. 2019), GAINS 
Figure 2.SM.5 | Comparison of estimates from different versions of the EDGAR database for anthropogenic N 2O emissions.  Chapter 2 Supplementary Material Emissions Trends and Drivers2SM
2SM-18(Winiwarter et al. 2018), FAOSTAT-N 2O (Tubiello et al. 2013; Tubiello 
2018), CEDS (Hoesly et al. 2018; McDuffie et al. 2020; O’Rourke et al. 
2020), PRIMAP-hist (Gütschow et al. 2016, 2021b), and GFED (van 
der Werf et  al. 2017). While EDGAR and GAINS cover all sectors 
except biomass burning, FAOSTAT-N 2O is focused on agriculture and 
biomass burning and GFED on biomass burning only. As shown in 
Figure  2.SM.1, EDGAR, GAINS, CEDS and FAOSTAT emissions are 
consistent in magnitude and trend. Recent revisions in estimating 
indirect N 2O emissions in EDGARv6 led to an average increase of 
1.5% yr–1 in total N 2O emissions estimates between 1999 and 2018 
compared to the two previous versions (differences before 1999 were 
negligible at less than 1% yr–1). Differences across versions of the 
EDGAR dataset are shown in Figure 2.SM.5. The main discrepancies 
across different global inventories are in agriculture, where emissions 
estimates from the global N 2O budget and FAOSTAT are, on average, 
1.5  MtN 2O yr–1 higher than those from GAINS and EDGAR during 
1990–2016. This is due to higher estimates of direct emissions from 
fertilised soils and manure left on pasture. GCP-N 2O provides the 
largest estimate (Figure  2.SM.1), because it synthesised from the 
other three inventories and further informed by additional bottom-
up modelling estimates – and is more comprehensive in scope due to 
the new sector discussed above. EDGAR estimates of anthropogenic 
N2O emissions as used in this dataset should therefore be considered 
as lower bound estimates (see also Table 2.SM.6).
Anthropogenic N 2O emissions estimates are subject to considerable 
uncertainty – larger than those from FFI-CO 2 or CH 4 emissions. N 2O 
inventories suffer from high uncertainty on input data, including 
fertiliser use, livestock manure availability, storage and applications 
(Galloway et al. 2010; Steinfeld et al. 2010) as well as nutrient, crops 
and soils management (Ciais et  al. 2014; Shcherbak et  al. 2014). 
Emission factors are also uncertain (Crutzen et  al. 2008; Hu et  al. 
2012; IPCC 2019; Yuan et al. 2019) and several sources are not yet 
well understood (e.g., peatland degradation, permafrost) (Elberling 
et al. 2010; Wagner-Riddle et al. 2017; Winiwarter et al. 2018). Model-
based estimates face uncertainties associated with the specific model 
configuration as well as parametrisation (Buitenhuis et  al. 2018; 
Tian et al. 2018, 2019). Total uncertainty is also large, because N 2O 
emissions are dominated by emissions from soils, where the level of 
process understanding is rapidly changing. For EDGAR, uncertainties in N 2O emissions are estimated based on 
default values (IPCC 2006) at ±42% for 24 OECD90 countries and at 
±93% for other countries for a 95% confidence interval (Janssens-
Maenhout et  al. 2019). However, Solazzo et  al. (2021) arrive at 
substantially larger values allowing for correlation of uncertainties 
between sectors, countries and regions. At a sector level, uncertainties 
are larger for agriculture (263%) than for energy (113%), waste 
(181%), industrial processes and product use (14%) and other 
(112%). In the recent Emissions Gap Report (UNEP 2020) relative 
uncertainties for global anthropogenic N 2O emissions are estimated 
at ±50% for a 68% (1σ) confidence interval. This is larger than the 
±60% uncertainties reported in IPCC AR5 for a 90% confidence 
interval (Blanco et al. 2014), but is comparable with the ranges for 
anthropogenic emissions in the global N 2O budget (Tian et al. 2020). 
Overall, we assess the relative uncertainty for global anthropogenic 
N2O emissions at ±60% for a 90% confidence interval.
2.SM.2.5 Fluorinated Gases
Fluorinated gases comprise over a dozen different species that 
are primarily used as refrigerants, solvents and aerosols. Here we 
compare global emissions of F-gases estimated in EDGAR to top-
down estimates from the 2018 World Meteorological Organization’s 
(WMO) Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion (Engel and Rigby 
2018; Montzka and Velders 2018). The top-down estimates were 
based on measurements by the Advanced Global Atmospheric 
Gases Experiment (AGAGE) (Prinn et al. 2018) and National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (Montzka et  al. 2015), 
assimilated into a global box model – using the method described in 
Rigby et al. (2014) and Engel and Rigby, et al. (2018). Uncertainties 
in the top-down estimates are due to measurement and transport 
model uncertainty. As F-gas emissions are almost entirely 
anthropogenic in nature, top-down estimates of anthropogenic 
fluxes are much better known than CO 2, CH 4, N 2O, where large 
natural fluxes contribute to the observed trends. For substances 
with relatively short lifetimes (~50 years or less), uncertainties are 
typically dominated by uncertainties in the atmospheric lifetimes. 
Comparisons between the EDGAR and WMO 2018 estimates were 
available for HFCs 125, 134a, 143a, 152a, 227ea, 23, 236fa, 245fa,

EDGARv6 and Olivier and Peters (2020) (EDGARv5FT) F-gas species 
(excluding heavy PFCs) is shown in Figure  2.SM.6 for the years 
1980–2016 (or a subset thereof, depending on the availability of 
the top-down estimates). Where available, the various top-down 
estimates agree with each other within uncertainties. The magnitude 
of the difference between the WMO (2018) and EDGAR estimates 
varies markedly between species, years and versions of EDGAR; for 
several HFCs, the top-down and bottom-up estimates often agree 
within uncertainties for EDGARv6 (but much less often in v5), whereas 
for c-C 4F8, the top-down estimate is more than 100 times the EDGAR 
estimates. Some similarities and differences have been previously 
noted for earlier versions of EDGAR (Mühle et al. 2010, 2019; Rigby 
et al. 2010; Lunt et al. 2015). For SF 6, the relatively close agreement 
between EDGARv4.0 and a top-down estimate has been discussed 
in Rigby, et al. (2010). They estimated uncertainties in EDGARv4.0 of 
±10% to ±15%, depending on the year, and top-down values were 
consistent within these uncertainties. However, the agreement is now 
poorer during the 1980s in EDGARv6. For some PFCs (e.g., CF 4, C2F6), 
it was previously noted that some assumptions within EDGARv4.0 
had been validated against atmospheric observations, hence 
EDGAR might be considered a hybrid of top-down and bottom-up methodologies for these species (Mühle et al. 2010). However, it is 
unclear for which other species similar validation has taken place, or 
how these assumptions vary between versions of EDGAR. 
When species are aggregated into F-gas total emissions, weighted by 
their current 100-year GWPs based on IPCC AR6 (Forster et al. 2021), 
we note that, in the left panel of Figure 2.SM.7, the Olivier and Peters 
(2020) (EDGARv5FT) estimates are around 10% lower than the WMO 

more rapidly than the top-down values and are almost 30% higher 
than WMO 2018 by the 2010s. EDGARv6 emissions are around 10% 
lower than the WMO 2018 values throughout. Given that detailed 
uncertainty estimates are not available for all EDGAR F-gas species, 
we base our uncertainty estimate solely on this comparison with the 
top-down values (Figure 2.SM.7, left panel), and therefore suggest 
a conservative uncertainty in aggregated F-gas emissions of ±30% 
for a 90% confidence interval. For individual species, the magnitude 
of this discrepancy can be orders of magnitude larger.
The F-gases in EDGAR exclude species such as chlorofluorocarbons 
(CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), which are groups of 
substances regulated under the Montreal Protocol. Historically, total 
CO2-eq F-gas emissions have been dominated by the CFCs (Engel and 
Rigby 2018). In particular, during the 1980s, peak annual emissions due 
to CFCs reached 9.1 ± 0.4 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 (Figure 2.SM.7), comparable

2SM2SM-21to that of CH 4, and substantially larger than the 2019 emissions of the 
gases included in EDGARv5FT and v6 (1.4 GtCO 2-eq). Subsequently, 
following the controls of the Montreal Protocol, emissions of CFCs 
declined substantially, while those of HCFCs and HFCs rose, such that 
CO2-eq emissions of the HFCs, HCFCs and CFCs were approximately 
equal by 2016, with a smaller contribution from PFCs, SF 6, NF 3 and 
some more minor F-gases. Therefore, the GWP-weighted F-gas 
emissions in EDGAR, which are dominated by the HFCs, represent 
less than half of the overall CO 2-eq F-gas emissions in 2016.
2.SM.2.6 Aggregated GHG Emissions
Based on the assessment of relevant uncertainties above, constant, 
relative uncertainty estimates for GHGs are applied at a 90% 
confidence interval that range from relatively low for CO 2 FFI 
(±8%), to intermediate values for CH 4 and F-gases (±30%), to 
higher values for N 2O (±60%) and CO 2 from LULUCF (±70%). To 
aggregate these and estimate uncertainties for total GHGs in terms 
of CO 2-eq emissions, the square root of the squared sums of absolute 
uncertainties for individual (groups of) gases are taken, using 100-
year global warming potentials (GWP100) with values from IPCC AR6 
(Forster et al. 2021, Section 7.6 and Supplementary Material 7.SM.6) 
to weight emissions of non-CO 2 gases but excluding uncertainties in 
the metric itself. An estimate of this ‘metric uncertainty’ is provided 
in the next section. Overall, this uncertainty assessment is broadly 
in line with IPCC AR5 (Blanco et al. 2014), but provides important 
adjustments in the evaluation of uncertainties of individual gases 
(CH 4, F-gases, CO 2-LULUCF) as well as the approach in reporting total 
uncertainties across GHGs. 
2.SM.2.7 Uncertainties of GHG Emission Metrics Used 
to Report Aggregated Emissions
GHG emission metrics are necessary if emissions of non-CO 2 gases 
and CO 2 are to be aggregated into CO 2-eq emissions (Section 2.3). 
GWP100 is the most common metric and has been adopted for 
emissions reporting under the transparency framework for the Paris 
Agreement (UNFCCC 2019), but many alternative metrics exist in the 
scientific literature. The most appropriate choice of metric depends 
on the climate policy objective and the specific use of the metric to 
support that objective (i.e., why do we want to aggregate or compare 
emissions of different gases? What specific actions do we wish 
to inform?).
Different metric choices and time horizons can result in very different 
weightings of the emissions of short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs), 
such as CH 4. For example, 1t CH 4 represents as much as 81 tCO 2-eq 
if a global warming potential (GWP) is used with a time horizon of 

potential (GTP) is used with a time horizon of 100 years (Forster et al. 
2021a). More recent metric developments that compare emissions 
in new ways – e.g., the additional warming from sustained changes 
in SLCF emissions compared to pulse emissions of CO 2 – increase 
the range of metric values further and can even result in negative metric values for SLCFs, if their emissions are falling rapidly (Allen 
et al. 2018; Cain et al. 2019; Collins et al. 2019; Lynch et al. 2020).
The contribution of SLCF emissions to total GHG emissions expressed 
in CO 2-eq thus depends critically on the choice of GHG metric and its 
time horizon. However, even for a given choice, the metric value for 
each gas is also subject to uncertainties. For example, the GWP100 
for biogenic CH 4 has changed from 21 based on the IPCC Second 
Assessment Report (SAR) in 1995 to 28 or 34 based on IPCC AR5 
(excluding or including climate-carbon cycle feedbacks), and to 27 
based on IPCC AR6. These changes and remaining uncertainties 
arise from parametric uncertainties, differences in methodological 
choices, and changes in metric values over time due to changing 
background conditions.
Parametric uncertainties arise from uncertainties in climate sensitivity, 
radiative efficacy and atmospheric lifetimes of CO 2 and non-CO 2 
gases, etc. The WGI contribution to AR6 assessed the parametric 
uncertainty of GWP for CH 4 as ±32% and ±40% for time horizons 
of 20 and 100 years, ±43% and ±47% for N 2O, and ±26–31 and 
±33–38% for various F-gases (Forster et al. 2021). The uncertainty 
of GTP100 for CH 4 was estimated at ±83%, which is larger than the 
uncertainty in a forcing-based metric due to uncertainties in climate 
responses to forcing (e.g., transient climate sensitivity). 
Methodological choices introduce a different type of uncertainty, 
namely which indirect effects are included in the calculation of metric 
values and the strength of those feedbacks. For CH 4, indirect forcing 
caused by photochemical decay products (mainly tropospheric ozone 
and stratospheric water vapour) contributes almost 40% of the total 
forcing from CH 4 emissions. More than half of the changes in GWP100 
values for CH 4 in successive IPCC assessments from 1995 to 2013 are 
due to re-evaluations of these indirect forcings. In addition, warming 
due to the emission of non-CO 2 gases extends the lifetime of CO 2 
already in the atmosphere through climate-carbon cycle feedbacks 
(Friedlingstein et  al. 2013). Including these feedbacks results in 
higher metric values for all non-CO 2 gases, but the magnitude of 
this effect is uncertain – for example, AR5 found the GWP100 value 
for CH 4 without climate-carbon cycle feedbacks to be 28, whereas 
including this feedback would raise the value to between 31 and 34 
(Myhre et al. 2013; Gasser et al. 2016; Sterner and Johansson 2017). 
The AR6 includes climate-carbon cycle feedbacks (Forster et al. 2021). 
These parametric uncertainties associated with different feedbacks 
are incorporated into the above uncertainty estimates by WGI.
A third uncertainty arises from changes in metric values over time. 
Metric values depend on the radiative efficacy of CO 2 and non-
CO2 emissions, which in turn depend on the changing atmospheric 
background concentrations of those gases. Rising temperature can 
further affect the lifetime of some gases and hence their contribution 
to forcing over time for different emission scenarios (Reisinger 
et  al. 2011). Successive IPCC assessments take changing starting-
year background conditions into account, which explains part of 
the changes in GWP100 metric values in different reports. Applying 
a single metric value to a multi-decadal historical time series of 
emissions is therefore only an approximation of the correct metric 
value for any given emissions year – as, for example, the correct Chapter 2 Supplementary Material Emissions Trends and Drivers2SM
2SM-22GWP100 value for CH 4 emitted in the year 1970 will be different to 
the GWP100 value for an emission in the year 2018. However, the 
literature does not offer a complete set of GWP100 metric values 
for past concentrations and climate conditions covered in our time 
series.
Overall, we estimate the uncertainty in GWP100 metric values, if 
applied to an extended historical emission time series, as ±50% 
for CH 4 and other SLCFs, and ±40% for non-CO 2 gases with longer 
atmospheric lifetimes (specifically, those with lifetimes longer than 20 
years). If uncertainties in GHG metrics are considered and assumed to 
be independent for each gas (which may lead to an underestimate), 
the overall uncertainty of total GHG emissions in 2019 increases from 
±11% to ±13%. However, these GWP-related uncertainties are not 
included in the global, regional or sectoral emissions estimates in the 
remainder of the assessment. 
The WGIII assessment uses GWP100 metric values from the WGI 
contribution to AR6 (Forster et al. 2021) as a default metric when 
presenting aggregated emissions and removals of different GHGs 
(Cross-Chapter Box 2, Supplementary Material Section 2.SM.3, and 
Annex II.8).
2.SM.3 GHG Emission Metrics
2.SM.3.1 Definition and Scope
GHG emission metrics are used to compare climate effects of 
different GHGs and to aggregate emissions and removals of different 
GHGs, such as for national inventory reporting and development 
of mitigation policies. GHG emission metrics provide simplified 
information about the effects that emissions of different gases GHGs 
have on global temperature or other aspects of climate, usually 
expressed relative to the effect of emitting CO 2. 
The common glossary for the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) 
defines GHG emission metrics as follows:
A simplified relationship used to quantify the effect of emitting a unit 
mass of a given greenhouse gas (GHG) on a specified key measure 
of climate change. A relative GHG emission metric expresses the 
effect from one gas relative to the effect of emitting a unit mass of 
a reference GHG on the same measure of climate change. There are 
multiple emission metrics, and the most appropriate metric depends 
on the application. GHG emission metrics may differ with respect to: 
(i) the key measure of climate change they consider; (ii) whether they 
consider climate outcomes for a specified point in time or integrated 
over a specified time horizon; (iii) the time horizon over which the 
metric is applied; (iv) whether they apply to a single emission pulse, 
emissions sustained over a period of time, or a combination of both; 
and (v) whether they consider the climate effect from an emission 
compared to the absence of that emission or compared to a reference 
emissions level or climate state.
Notes: most relative GHG emission metrics (such as the global 
warming potential (GWP), global temperature change potential (GTP), global damage potential, and GWP*), use carbon dioxide (CO 2) 
as the reference gas. Emissions of non-CO 2 gases, when expressed 
using such metrics, are often referred to as ‘carbon dioxide equivalent’ 
emissions. A metric that establishes equivalence regarding one key 
measure of the climate system response to emissions does not imply 
equivalence regarding other key measures. The choice of a metric, 
including its time horizon, should reflect the policy objectives for 
which the metric is applied.
Emission metrics also exist for aerosols, but these are not commonly 
used in climate policy. This assessment focuses on GHG emission 
metrics only.
Parties to the Paris Agreement decided in the Paris Agreement 
Rulebook to report aggregated emissions based on the global 
warming potential with a time horizon of 100 years (GWP100) 
from AR5, or to use GWP100 values from a subsequent IPCC report 
as agreed upon by the CMA (UNFCCC 2019, 18/CMA.1), and to 
account for their second and subsequent Nationally Determined 
Contributions in accordance with this approach (UNFCCC 2019, 
4/CMA.1). However, parties can report supplemental information 
about aggregate emissions and removals using other GHG emission 
metrics (e.g., global temperature change potential) expressed in 
CO2-eq and assessed by the IPCC.
Apart from international reporting and accounting, countries or 
sectors might consider other GHG emission metrics to help achieve 
specific domestic policy objectives. A clear assessment of metrics 
can help decision-makers determine the consistency between policy 
goals and metrics and avoid potentially inadvertent consequences of 
alternative metric choices.
This Supplementary Material provides additional explanations, 
references and figures to the assessment of GHG emission metrics 
from a mitigation perspective in Cross-Chapter Box  2 on GHG 
emission metrics in Chapter 2. Both the Cross-Chapter Box and this 
Supplementary Material build on the physical science assessment of 
GHG emission metrics by WGI (Forster et al. 2021, Section 7.6).
2.SM.3.2 Key Characteristics of Pulse Emission Metrics 
GWP and GTP
The global warming potential (GWP) and the global temperature 
change potential (GTP) were the main metrics assessed in AR5 
(Myhre et al. 2013; IPCC 2014; Kolstad et al. 2014). GWP with a time 
horizon of 100 years (GWP100) is the predominant metric used in 
literature assessed by WGIII.
These metrics compare the effect on climate of emitting a unit mass 
of a non-CO 2 gas over a chosen time horizon with the effect of 
emitting the same unit mass of CO 2. GWP compares CO 2 and non-CO 2 
emissions based on the radiative forcing they would cause integrated 
over the entire time horizon, whereas GTP compares emissions based 
on the global mean surface temperature change they would cause 
only at the end point of the chosen time horizon.Emissions Trends and Drivers Chapter 2 Supplementary Material
2SM2SM-23The WGI contribution to AR6 includes updated values for these 
metrics based on updated scientific understanding of the response 
of the climate system to emissions of different gases, including 
changing background concentrations (Forster et  al. 2021). It also 
assess new metrics published since AR5. Metric values in AR6 include 
climate-carbon cycle feedbacks by default; this provides an important 
update and clarification from AR5 which reported metric values both 
with and without such feedbacks (Table 2.SM.7).
By far the most commonly used, static time horizon for GWP , 
including in reporting under the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement, is 

been applied (recent examples include Tanaka et al. 2019, 2021; and 
Skytt et al. 2020).
For GTP , both static and dynamic time horizons are used in the literature. 
A static GTP evaluates warming due to an emissions pulse at the end 
point of the stated time horizon (Shine et al. 2005). For example, the 
static GTP100 would evaluate emissions occurring in 2020 based on 
the warming they would cause in the year 2120, whereas emissions 
occurring in 2030 would be evaluated based on the warming they 
would cause in the year 2130. By contrast, the dynamic GTP (Shine 
et  al. 2007) evaluates each emission based on its contribution to 
warming in a specified future target year. Depending on application, 
this can be the year in which global average temperature is expected 
to peak within a mitigation scenario, or any other time-bound 
temperature-related climate target. Policy-relevant time horizons and 
resulting metric values for the dynamic GTP therefore depend on the 
chosen temperature goal and implied target year.
The time horizon of a dynamic GTP shrinks for successive emissions 
as the target year is approached, which increases the weight given to 
emissions of short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs) such as CH 4 over time. 
For example, for a climate policy goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C 
with no or limited overshoot (scenario Category C1 in Chapter 3), 
global average surface temperature would peak by around 2055. To 
compare the importance of abating non-CO 2 and CO 2 emissions in 
any given year relative to that policy goal, emissions occurring in the 
year 2020 would be evaluated using GTP35, whereas emissions in 

for illustrative values).
A key limitation of pulse emission metrics such as GWP and GTP , 
noted in AR5 and emphasised in more recent literature (Allen et al. 
2018; Cain et al. 2019; Collins et al. 2019; Allen et al. 2021; see Forster 
et  al. 2021 for the WGI assessment), is that metric values depend 
strongly on the selected time horizon, given that warming from a CH 4 
emission pulse declines over time, whereas warming from a pulse of CO2 is nearly constant over centuries. Universal use of a single metric 
and time horizon can thus result in mismatches between policy goals 
and actual climate outcomes. Moreover, ‘CO 2 equivalence’ of pulse 
emissions based on GWP or GTP does not imply equivalent climate 
outcomes from cumulative emissions, nor at all times even from 
a single emissions pulse.
This is illustrated in Figure 2.SM.8, which shows that the warming 
from CH 4 emissions sustained at a constant rate is greater than 
the warming from an ‘equivalent’ (based on GWP100) amount 
of sustained CO 2 emissions for the first 100 years, but the rate of 
warming from sustained CH 4 emissions declines over time and the 
total warming becomes less than that from sustained CO 2 emissions 
beyond the first century. The different cumulative behaviour of CO 2 
and SLCF emissions is particularly relevant in mitigation scenarios: 
each tonne of additional CO 2 emissions causes further warming 
until emissions reach net zero (Canadell et  al. 2021). By contrast, 
declining SLCF emissions can result in a declining SLCF contribution 
to global temperature since the warming from past emissions does 
not persist and declines over time. This behaviour is well known and 
can be readily replicated with simple climate models (Figure 2.SM.8) 
but cumulative SLCF emissions based on GWP100 do not capture this 
decline (Lynch et al. 2020).
A more detailed discussion of recently developed step-change 
metrics GWP* (Allen et al. 2018; Cain et al. 2019; Smith et al. 2021) 
and combined global temperature change potential (CGTP) (Collins 
et  al. 2019) and their ability to reproduce temperature changes 
resulting from sustained changes in SLCF emissions is provided in 
Forster et al. (2021). These metrics indicate greater climate benefits 
from rapid and sustained CH 4 reductions compared to CO 2 over the 
next few decades than if such reductions are weighted by GWP100, 
while conversely, sustained methane increases have greater adverse 
climate impacts (Collins et al. 2019; Lynch et al. 2020; Brazzola et al. 
2021). However, as indicated in Figure  2.SM.8, the warming from 
CH4 (or conversely, the benefits of CH 4 reduction) do not continue to 
accumulate at the initial rate.
2.SM.3.3 Relationship of GWP and GTP to Cost-benefit 
and Cost-effectiveness Frameworks
The GWP with a static time horizon approximates the global damage 
potential – that is, the notion that the emission of a non-CO 2 forcer 
at any point in time should be weighted by the marginal economic 
damages from this emission, relative to the marginal damages from 
emitting a unit mass of CO 2 (Reilly and Richards 1993; Kandlikar 
1996; Kolstad et al. 2014). Table 2.SM.7 | Illustrative metric values for CH 4 under a range of metrics and time horizons. GWP and GTP compare pulse emissions of non-CO 2 gases with 
a pulse emission of CO 2. Combined global temperature change potential (CGTP) compares a sustained step-change in non-CO 2 emissions with a pulse emission of CO 2. Values 
are based on Forster et al. (2021).

2SM-24The GWP time horizon can be linked to the social discount rate used 
in the global damage potential to calculate the net present value 
of economic damages over time from each emission. Recent studies 
(Sarofim and Giordano 2018; Mallapragada and Mignone 2019) 
confirm earlier work (Fuglestvedt et al. 2003; Boucher 2012) that, for 
methane, GWP100 is consistent with a discount rate of about 3%, 
with the specific value depending on the gas and other assumptions 
such as non-linearity of damages with warming. Detailed sensitivity 
analysis by Sarofim and Giordano (2018) gives an interquartile 
range of 2.7–4.1% for the implied discount rate for GWP100 in the 
case of CH 4, depending on a range of assumptions about climate 
scenarios, shape of damage functions, climate feedbacks and global 
economic growth. GWP20 would imply much higher discount rates 
of 11.1–14.6%, given the stronger weighting of near-term effects on 
climate. Use of a single discount rate based on pure time preference 
and future growth in wealth and its effects (known as the simple 
Ramsey rule) can be problematic (Drupp et al. 2018) but no studies 
so far have evaluated metrics with varying discount rates over 
time. In addition, the relationship between GWP time horizon and 
discount rate is not universal as it depends on the lifetime of the SLCF 
(Fuglestvedt et al. 2003).
Shindell et al. (2017) evaluated the social cost of methane emissions 
directly based on time-varying changes in climate and inferred 
economic damages, and found a wide range of possible values 
This reflects the range of judgements in determining social costs of 
pollutants including non-climate effects. However, their results are 
broadly consistent with a GWP100-based weighting of CH 4 relative 
to CO 2 when similar discount rates and consistent assumptions 
about climate-related damages and the temperature dependence of 
damage functions are chosen for both gases. These studies indicate that, even though the GWP100 was not 
designed to meet any economic objectives and was not designed 
as a damage potential, the discount rate implied in GWP100 for CH 4 
is broadly similar to social discount rates of 3–5% that are used in 
integrated assessment models (Chapter  3) and investments with 
multi-decadal lifetimes (Giglio et al. 2015; HM Treasury 2018).
In principle, GHG emission metrics focused on cost-effectiveness 
are better matched to the Paris Agreement’s temperature goal 
than cost-benefit metrics, and are also supported by the UNFCCC 
principle that mitigation policies and measures should be cost-
effective (Johansson, 2011; Tol et  al. 2012; Tanaka et  al. 2020). In 
cost-effectiveness metrics, values for SLCF emissions necessarily 
change over time since the closer SLCF emissions occur to the target 
year, the greater their contribution to climate change in that year 
(Aaheim and Mideksa 2017). The dynamic GTP (Shine et al. 2007) 
reflects such a cost-effectiveness approach by providing information 
on the marginal contribution of SLCF emissions in any given year 
to the expected peak warming at a future date (Tol et  al. 2012; 
Mallapragada and Mignone 2017; Tanaka et al. 2020). However, the 
dynamic GTP does not fully match the optimal weighting of gases in 
least-cost mitigation pathways (also referred to as the global cost 
potential; e.g., Michaelis 1992; Manne and Richels 2001) because 
overall mitigation costs and hence the economically optimal amount 
and timing of SLCF abatement also depends on the discount rate 
as well as treatment of uncertainties, not only their contribution to 
warming in the target year (Johansson 2011; Ekholm 2014; Strefler 
et al. 2014; Tanaka et al. 2020).
The GTP with any static time horizon (e.g., GTP50 or GTP100) is 
not clearly matched to either a cost-benefit or a cost-effectiveness 
framework, as the year for which temperature outcomes are evaluated 
would shift forward each year and hence would not match the year

caused by each emission (Tol et al. 2012; Edwards and Trancik 2014; 
Strefler et al. 2014; Mallapragada and Mignone 2017). However, use 
of GTP with a static time horizon may be relevant where it is applied 
to emissions only in a given year or finite period, and if the time 
horizon matches a relevant climate policy goal (Fuglestvedt et  al. 
2010; Grewe and Dahlmann 2015; Balcombe et al. 2018).
2.SM.3.4 Global Cost-effectiveness of Physical-based 
Pulse Emission Metrics
A number of studies since AR5 have evaluated the impact of 
different pulse GHG emission metrics and time horizons on the 
global economic costs of limiting global average temperature 
change to a pre-determined level, including to likely below 2°C and 
to 1.5°C (Ekholm et al. 2013; Deuber et al. 2014; Strefler et al. 2014; 
Huntingford et  al. 2015; Van Den Berg et  al. 2015; Harmsen et  al. 
2016; Tanaka et al. 2020). These studies show consistently, with very 
few exceptions, that global costs to achieve the same temperature 
target below 2°C in 2100, or the same peak temperature before 
2100, are higher if CH 4 emissions are weighted consistently less 
than indicated by GWP100 (e.g., if using GTP100 or GWP500). The 
increase in global mitigation costs ranges from a few percent to more 
than 30% in most studies, depending not only on the specific metric 
values used but also on the temperature limit, degree of overshoot, 
and abatement costs and potentials of different gases assumed in 
those studies. These studies also indicate, albeit less consistently and 
less significantly than for GTP100, that global mitigation costs would 
also increase if CH 4 emissions are valued consistently more highly 
than in GWP100 (e.g., using GWP20). Collectively, these studies 
indicate that, even though GWP100 does not represent the most 
cost-effective metric and time horizon choice possible (Tanaka et al. 
2020), it is more cost-effective than any of the other static metrics 
and time horizons that have been tested in economic models and are 
used most commonly in the scientific literature.
Studies available for AR5 suggested that using a dynamic GTP or 
economic optimisation approaches, which defer high-cost CH 4 
abatement until closer to the target year, could reduce global 
abatement costs compared to GWP100 by a few percent (Manne and 
Richels 2001; Shine et al. 2007; Johansson 2011; Reisinger et al. 2012). 
More recent studies confirm this theoretical cost saving in principle. 
However, these studies also demonstrate that the extent to which this 
cost saving would be realised depends on a range of assumptions, 
including the stringency of the target, degree of policy foresight, the 
speed with which CH 4 emissions can be reduced as metric values 
increase, allowance for any temporary temperature overshoot for 
end-of-century targets, the shape of marginal abatement cost curves, 
and the treatment of uncertainty (Ekholm et al. 2013; Strefler et al. 
2014; Huntingford et al. 2015; Van Den Berg et al. 2015; Harmsen 
et al. 2016; Tanaka et al. 2020).
One reason why the literature shows only a limited, if any, reduction 
in global mitigation costs from using dynamic GTP or economic 
optimisation compared to GWP100 lies in the broad similarity of 
the metric values or exchange rates for CH 4 for temperature limits of likely below 2°C and lower. For such temperature limits, peak 
temperature would be reached between about 2050 and 2080 
(Chapter 3). This means that emissions occurring in the year 2030 
would be weighted by GTP20 to GTP50, but emissions in the year 

numerical values of the dynamic GTP for CH 4 (as the main short-
lived GHG) over the next few decades are broadly comparable on 
average to GWP100 (Table  2.SM.7). Since a large fraction of the 
total abatement potential for CH 4 is assumed to be available at 
relatively low costs (Harmsen et al. 2019) or co-abated with fossil 
CO2 (Rogelj et al. 2014), abatement choices based on GWP100 differ 
little in such pathways from those based on the dynamic GTP or 
economic optimisation. For modelled mitigation pathways that likely 
limit warming to 2°C or below and with limited overshoot, GWP100 
therefore results in overall abatement levels and costs at the global 
scale that are not very different from those based on dynamic GTP or 
economic optimisation, even though GWP100 reflects a cost-benefit 
rather than cost-effectiveness framework. However, differences can 
be more pronounced for individual sectors.
A common feature of virtually all GHG emission metrics studies to 
date is that they use a single emission metric (either static GWP or 
GTP , or dynamic GTP with predictably changing values) to inform 
abatement choices over the entire 21st century and beyond. This is 
not well matched to the new scenario logic proposed by Rogelj et al. 
(2019) for the Paris Agreement, which suggests that separate policy 
choices exist regarding the timing and magnitude of the temperature 
peak and the post-peak rate of temperature decline. This new scenario 
logic has not yet been used to evaluate GHG metrics, but Tanaka 
et  al. (2021) show that global cost reductions could be obtained 
by using GWP100 as a starting metric and updating the GWP time 
horizon in discrete steps, depending on when and by how much the 
temperature goal might be exceeded based on actual emissions. This 
approach could reduce mitigation costs by a few percent, relative 
to GWP100 being used throughout the 21st century, in very high 
overshoot scenarios that reach the long-term temperature goal 
of 1.5°C or 2°C only in the 22nd century. For such scenarios, the 
most cost-effective weighting of SLCF emissions is generally less 
than GWP100 in the next few decades, but two to three times 
higher than GWP100 once temperature has peaked. These findings 
strengthen the conclusions by Fuglestvedt et al. (2018) and Tanaka 
and O’Neill (2018) that the choice of GHG metric is particularly 
important for the rate of temperature decline once net zero GHG 
emissions have been reached.
2.SM.3.5 Role of GHG Emission Metrics at the Sectoral 
Level Including Lifecycle Assessment
The AR5 noted that the choice of metric and time horizon could have 
significant implications for regions or sectors with high fractions 
of SLCF emissions (Brennan and Zaitchik 2013; Myhre et al. 2013; 
IPCC 2014; Strefler et al. 2014). The choice of GHG emission metric 
is therefore linked not only to cost-effectiveness but also to equity. 
Sectoral and national perspectives on mitigation pathways, including 
GHG emission metrics to inform such pathways, may therefore differ 
from a global least-cost perspective (Klinsky and Winkler 2018), but Chapter 2 Supplementary Material Emissions Trends and Drivers2SM
2SM-26the literature has not provided a consistent framework for assessing 
GHG emission metrics based on a wider set of equity principles.
The shifting of costs between emitters due to different metrics has 
been demonstrated for the case of agriculture in New Zealand, which 
has a high fraction of enteric methane emissions. Even though global 
mitigation costs to limit warming to below 2°C would be lower 
under GWP100 than GTP100, costs to farmers would be greater 
under GWP100 than GTP100 if climate policy were to price all 
GHG emissions and place the cost burden on emitters (Dorner and 
Kerr 2017).
Various studies evaluated the extent to which cost-effective sectoral 
abatement strategies might change under different climate metrics. 
In some instances (e.g., for transport and fuel choices), the choice of 
metric can change abatement preferences and timing (Edwards and 
Trancik 2014; Edwards et al. 2016; Edwards et al. 2017). Similarly, the 
magnitude of the climate impact from aviation when expressed in 
CO2-equivalents depends strongly on the choice of emission metric 
and time horizon, as SLCF emissions and contrails enhance warming 
significantly over days to decades, in addition to the warming from 
CO2 that occurs over centuries to millennia (Fuglestvedt et al. 2010; 
Azar and Johansson 2012; Deuber et  al. 2013; Lund et  al. 2017; 
Lee et  al. 2021). For the energy sector, Tanaka et  al. (2019) show 
that switching from coal to gas (which has lower CO 2 but higher 
CH4 emissions) for energy supply offers consistent climate benefits 
regardless of metric and time horizon unless CH 4 leakage rates are 
very high and a short-term metric (GWP20) is selected. Lynch and 
Pierrehumbert (2019) show that the climate impact of cultured meat 
(which they assume to have higher CO 2 but lower CH 4 emissions than 
cattle meat and a lower GHG footprint based on GWP100) increases 
over time, given the cumulative warming from CO 2 emissions. 
Substituting cattle meat with cultured meat would result in lower 
warming for at least the next several decades but could eventually 
result in higher warming than cattle meat, if this substitution is 
sustained over centuries and if the carbon intensity of energy supply 
for the manufacture of cultured meat does not decline.
For some sectors, mitigation strategies and the relative merit of 
specific technologies or practices compared to others (such as 
intensive vs extensive agricultural production and mitigation options, 
or choices to reduce air pollutants with a climate forcing effect) 
have been shown to be relatively robust against the choice of metric 
(Reisinger and Ledgard 2013; Ledgard and Reisinger 2014; Reisinger 
et al. 2017; Åström and Johansson 2019). Clark et al. (2020) show that 
current emissions trends in the global food system alone would be 
sufficient to exceed a 1.5°C temperature limit and associated global 
emission targets even if GWP* is used to calculate CO 2-equivalent 
emissions. This indicates that the importance of limiting food system 
emissions is not an artefact of using GWP100 as GHG emission 
metric, though it can change the quantification of CO 2-eq emissions 
over time. Even if the most effective mitigation option does not 
depend strongly on the choice of GHG emission metric, the cost to 
emitters (if emissions were priced based on their CO 2-equivalent 
values as part of national policies) can depend strongly on the GHG 
metric (Dorner and Kerr 2017).The United Nations Environment Programme Society of 
Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (UNEP-SETAC) task force 
on lifecycle assessment (LCA) recommended that at least two, but 
potentially even three, metrics with divergent weightings for SLCFs 
(GWP100 and GTP100 and potentially also GWP20) be used to better 
understand the extent to which GHG metric choices may implicitly 
or inadvertently affect reported carbon footprints (Cherubini 
et al. 2016; Levasseur et al. 2016; Jolliet et al. 2018). This matches 
recommendations by other researchers for the use of multiple 
metrics (Grewe and Dahlmann 2015; Ocko et  al. 2017; Balcombe 
et al. 2018; Cooper et al. 2020; Allen et al. 2021) especially where 
there is no unambiguous policy goal for a sectoral or entity-level 
LCA. While there is a strong agreement in the literature that using 
multiple metrics provides a more nuanced understanding of the 
climate effects of emissions, there is no strong consensus specific 
pairs or sets of metrics to use (e.g., GWP20 and GWP100, or GWP100 
and GTP100). GWP* has only had limited use in LCA so far, mainly 
to understand the impact of sustained changes in CH 4 emissions 
resulting from system changes or lifetime dietary choices, consistent 
with its focus on the effect of sustained emission changes (Clark et al. 
2020; Barnsley et al. 2021).
Some studies use simple climate models or pulse-response functions 
to understand the climate impacts of emissions of different gases 
directly rather than relying on emission metrics (Berntsen and 
Fuglestvedt 2008; Reisinger and Clark 2017; Lynch and Pierrehumbert 
2019; Mayfield et  al. 2019; Cooper et  al. 2020; Lee et  al. 2021; 
Reisinger et  al. 2021). Treating GHGs with different lifetimes 
separately supports the targeted treatment of different pollutants 
and avoids embedding value judgements about the climate outcome 
of concern, time horizons and reference levels into GHG emission 
metrics. This does not avoid the need for such value judgements to be 
made, but can allow them to be made more explicitly.
2.SM.3.6 Difference Between Marginal and Additional 
Warming and Relationship to Metrics 
Cross-Chapter Box  2 in Chapter  2 notes that GWP* can calculate 
negative CO 2-eq emissions, while GWP or GTP calculate positive 
CO2-eq emissions for the same CH 4 emissions path.
Rapidly declining CH 4 emissions can have a negative CO 2-warming-
equivalent value based on GWP* because SLCF emissions that 
decline at a sufficient rate result in declining temperature, relative 
to the warming at a previous point in time caused by past SLCF 
emissions from that same source. The rate at which SLCF emissions 
have to decline to result in a roughly constant contribution to 
warming depends on the emissions history, changing background 
concentrations, and lifetime of the gas; for global CH 4 emissions, this 
has been estimated at about 0.3% per year (Forster et al. 2021).
GWP or GTP always assign a positive CO 2-equivalent value to 
SLCF emissions because every SLCF emission from any source 
results in increased future radiative forcing and higher global 
average temperature than would be the case without this emission, 
regardless of whether the rate of SLCF emissions is rising or declining Emissions Trends and Drivers Chapter 2 Supplementary Material
2SM2SM-27over time. The amount of climate change (integrated radiative 
forcing, or temperature change at a given point in time) that occurs 
from these emissions, relative to the absence of these emissions 
(everything else being equal), has also been referred to as ‘marginal 
warming’ (Reisinger et al. 2021), in alignment with the concepts of 
marginal damages and marginal costs that underpin the economics 
literature on multi-pollutant problems (Michaelis 1992, 1999; Reilly 
and Richards 1993; Kandlikar 1996; Manne and Richels 2001; Tol 
et al. 2012).
Figure 2.SM.9 illustrates these different perspectives: in an Illustrative 
Mitigation Pathway that limits warming to 1.5°C with no or limited 
overshoot (IMP-Ren15) (Chapter  3 and Annex III), the marginal 
warming from future CH 4 emissions is always positive and can be 
comparable to the marginal warming from future CO 2 emissions. That 
is, emissions of CH 4 and CO 2 from 2020 onwards (or any other specified 
reference year) both result in future global temperature being higher 
than it would be without those future emissions. Marginal warming is 
relevant for choices about the effort and costs that might be justified 
(from a damages, cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness perspective) to 
mitigate future emissions of either gas. The specific policy objective 
can then help determine what specific metric and time horizon would 
be optimal to use, provided that metrics are applied in a way that 
captures this marginal warming from future emissions. Information 
about marginal warming by definition does not include warming 
from past emissions that may continue into the future.Warming relative to a given reference point provides a different 
perspective: the contribution from CH 4 emissions to global warming 
declines with declining emissions, whereas the contribution from 
CO2 emissions to global warming continues to rise even when its 
emissions decline, and this contribution keeps rising until CO 2 
emissions are reduced to net zero. CO 2 therefore remains and 
becomes the increasingly dominant driver of anthropogenic warming 
in virtually all emission scenarios (see also WGI Summary for 
Policymakers, Figure SPM.4). This information is relevant for policies 
and perspectives that are concerned with the changing contribution 
of individual gases and sectors to global warming over multiple 
decades, including their historical emissions (e.g., Lynch et al. 2021). 
Figure  2.SM.9 shows that, for CO 2, the marginal and additional 
warming from future emissions is virtually identical, whereas the 
marginal and additional warming from future CH 4 emissions point in 
opposite directions in a mitigation pathway. Marginal metrics such 
as GWP and GTP , and step/pulse metrics such as GWP* (as applied 
in the literature so far) can differ substantially in the CO 2 emissions 
they calculate as ‘equivalent’ to CH 4 emissions, because they focus 
on different aspects of climate change. The specific policy objective 
(e.g., a focus on cost-effective abatement, a cost-benefit approach, 
or a focus on additional warming compared to a reference level) is 
therefore crucial for choosing and applying a metric that matches 
a given objective.

2SM-282.SM.3.7 Influence of GHG Emission Metrics on the 
Timing of Reported Net Zero GHG Emissions
Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 2 notes that different metric choices 
can alter the reported quantity of CO 2-eq emissions and the time 
at which net zero GHG emissions are calculated to be reached, or 
whether net zero GHG emissions are reached at all. This is also an 
important conclusion from the assessment by WGI (Forster et  al. 
2021) building on Fuglestvedt et al. (2018) and Tanaka and O’Neill 
(2018), and highlighted by Schleussner et  al. (2019) in relation to 
Article 4.1 of the Paris Agreement.
The degree to which reported CO 2-eq emissions would differ under 
alternative metrics, for the same actual emissions of different gases, 
is illustrated in Figure 2.SM.10. It shows calculated CO 2-eq emissions 
for four different IMPs from Chapter  3 (IMP-REN15, IMP-SP , 
IMP-REN2, and IMP-GS; see Chapter 3 for details on these pathways) 
for an illustrative range of metrics. 
The following metrics and time horizons are used:
• GWP100 (using values from the Second Assessment Report (SAR); 
Fifth Assessment Report with and without climate-carbon cycle 
feedbacks (AR5-ccfb, and AR5-nofb); and the Sixth Assessment 
Report (AR6))
• GTP100 (using AR6 values)
• GWP20 (using AR6 values)
• GWP* (using the formula in Lynch et al. 2020, using AR6 values 
for GWP100).1
Overall, differences in the timing of net zero GHG (CO 2-eq) emissions 
are smaller for different versions of GWP100 than for fundamentally 
different choices of metric and/or time horizon (GWP20 or GTP100), 
and differ materially for GWP*. 
Using GWP100 values from different IPCC assessment reports has 
a  relatively minor effect on CO 2-eq emissions. It shifts the timing 
of net zero emissions by up to 10 years for those pathways that 
reach net zero before 2100. For pathways that reach net zero GHG 
emissions only very late in the 21st century, this could result in net 
zero not being reached at all before 2100 under some versions of 
GWP100. For example, IMP-GS reaches net zero GHG emissions in 


Using GTP100 gives consistently lower weighting to SLCF emissions 
compared to GWP100. This brings the year of net zero GHG 
emissions  forward by 12–18 years compared to GWP100 (AR6), 
since the remaining gross SLCF emissions would be aggregated into 
lower CO 2-eq emissions and hence would be compensated by a lower 
amount of net negative CO 2 emissions, which is reached earlier. 

based on the atmospheric lifetime of CH 4 and are not necessarily matched to other short-lived gases. Results should therefore be seen as indicative only; the existing 
literature provides parameters only for CH 4. Using further updated parameters from Smith et al. (2021) would not change the overall results substantially.The difference in timing of net zero GHG emissions under GTP100 
compared to GWP100 depends on the magnitude of SLCF (mostly CH 4) 
emissions at that point, as well as the slope of the emissions pathway 
when approaching net zero. IMP-SP has the largest reductions in CH 4 
emissions and hence the difference between GTP100 and GWP100 
is relatively smaller than for other pathways. Conversely, IMP-Ren2 
relatively high residual CH 4 emissions. Therefore, expressing 
CO2-equivalent emissions using GTP100 has a bigger impact on total 
CO2-eq emissions compared to GWP100.
Using GWP20 gives consistently higher weighting to SLCF emissions 
compared to GWP100. This shifts the year of net zero emissions back 
by more than 20 years, as more net negative CO 2 emissions are 
needed to balance residual SLCF emissions; again the extent to 
which timing shifts depends on the amount of CH 4 emissions in the 
different pathways. Under GWP20, only IMP-REN2 reaches net zero 
in 2100 as it has the largest net-negative CO 2 emissions in 2100 
of those four pathways; the three other pathways would remain at 
greater than net zero GHG emissions in 2100.
Using GWP* as a metric results in a significant change, not only in 
the timing of net zero emissions, but also the overall shape of the 
CO2-eq emissions pathway. In the two pathways consistent with 
limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot (IMP-Ren15 
and IMP-SP), CO 2-equivalent emissions using GWP* drop well below 
net zero before 2040 but then rebound again. IMP-Ren15 returns to 
net-positive GHG emissions before returning to net zero by 2100, 
while IMP-SP has emissions close to net zero for most of the second 
half of the 21st century. 
CO2-equivalent emissions using GWP* for IMP-GS follow a similar 
shape but have higher overall levels; net GHG emissions would briefly 
reach net zero in 2040 before returning to positive levels and dropping 
to net zero by 2080. For IMP-Ren2, CO 2-equivalent emissions based 
on GWP* look more similar to the emissions pathway based on other 
metrics but reach net zero GHG emissions about 20 years earlier than 
if using GWP100. 
The reason for those different shapes of CO 2-equivalent emission 
trajectories under GWP* is that this metric translates rapid reductions 
of CH 4 emissions into negative CO 2-equivalent emissions. IMP-Ren2 
pathway has less rapid reductions of CH 4 emissions in the near term 
than the three other pathways. The rapid reduction of methane in 
these three pathways results in a significantly faster and greater 
reduction of total CO 2-equivalent emissions under GWP*. As a result, 
net zero GHG emissions would be reached well before 2050, although 
(depending on further reductions) only temporarily in some pathways 
as the reduction of CH 4 emissions does not continue at the same rate.
Note that the different reported CO 2-equivalent emissions do not 
affect the climate outcome, as the actual emissions of individual 
gases in these pathways are unchanged. What Figure 2.SM.10 shows Emissions Trends and Drivers Chapter 2 Supplementary Material
2SM2SM-29is only how the global aggregated emissions and removals would be 
reported for each pathway under different metrics.
The significant differences in the timing of net zero GHG emissions 
imply, however, that alternative emissions pathways that reach the 
same net zero GHG emissions target, but do so based on different 
GHG metrics, would necessarily result in different climate outcomes 
and would imply different levels of ambition to reach such an 
emissions target.
This is because depending on the GHG emission metric, a given 
amount of residual SLCF emissions in mitigation pathways would 
require different amounts of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) to achieve net zero GHG emissions. Emission metrics that give less weight to 
ongoing SLCF emissions imply a lesser rate of CO 2 removal and hence 
greater overall warming and/or lesser reduction in warming over time 
after net zero GHG emissions have been reached. Conversely, a given 
amount of CDR would permit different rates of SLCF emissions to 
achieve net zero GHG emissions under different metrics. This would 
result in different amounts of warming contributed by SLCF emissions 
in addition to the warming from CO 2.
For a given net zero target in a given year, using different metrics 
to monitor and verify achievement of that target therefore results 
in different levels of peak warming and different contributions of 
individual gases to this warming, and different rates of temperature

metrics assessed in AR6 (for details, see text).  Illustrative Mitigation Pathways (IMPs) explore different ways of achieving long-term temperature goals. The four IMPs 
shown here are: higher Renewable Energy (IMP-Ren2 and IMP-Ren15); Gradual Strengthening of current policies (IMP-GS); and a Shifting Pathway (IMP-SP). Each of these 
pathways can be implemented with different levels of ambition. The IMP-Ren2 and IMP-GS (top panels) are consistent with limiting warming likely below 2°C, while IMP-Ren15 
and IMP-SP (bottom panels) are consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot. (Box 3.1, 3.2.5, Annex III).Chapter 2 Supplementary Material Emissions Trends and Drivers2SM

(Fuglestvedt et al. 2018; Tanaka and O’Neill 2018; Schleussner et al. 
2019). This is before taking into account how the use of different 
GHG emission metrics might shape abatement choices leading up to 
an emission target.
2.SM.4 Trade as a Driver of Global 
GHG Emissions
This section assesses how trade openness and liberalisation may 
have changed the global level of GHG emissions, and complements 
Sections 2.3 and 2.4 in Chapter  2. It does not describe whether 
trade has shifted emissions between countries (transfer of embodied 
emissions) or has changed the level of emissions in individual 
countries (this is described in Chapter 2, Section 2.3). The effect of 
international emissions trading schemes, mechanisms, and policies 
are described in Chapter 2, Sections 2.8 and 14.5, respectively. 
The question of whether international trade drives increases or 
decreases in global GHG emissions is difficult to answer since it not 
only depends on the emissions intensity of traded products, but also 
on the synergistic influence of trade on economic growth, income, 
consumption patterns, and the diffusion of low-carbon technologies 
or practices. All of these in turn are drivers of GHG emissions and the 
counterfactual question to answer is: What would happen without 
trade? (Jakob and Marschinski 2013). Trade also affects emissions 
through enhancing innovation and exchanging technologies between 
trading partners. These complex interactions are currently not fully 
understood (limited evidence, low agreement) (Cherniwchan et  al. 
2017). Consumption-based accounting alone (Chapter 2, Section 2.3) 
is therefore not suited to assess whether or not trade is driving global 
GHG emissions (Jakob and Marschinski 2013; Kander et  al. 2015; 
Jiborn et al. 2018).
Only very few studies over the AR6 target time frame of 2010–2019 
investigated the impacts of trade. Studies investigating global CO 2 
emissions changes between 1995 and 2007/2008 found that the 
contribution of trade was moderately positive, whereas increases in 
overall and per capita consumption levels contributed much more 
strongly to the increase and improved technology had a significant 
decreasing effect (Arto and Dietzenbacher 2014; Hoekstra et  al. 
2016). A recent study modelled that international trade in 2015 
increased global GDP by 10% and global total GHG emissions by 2% 
compared to a scenario where there was no trade (Wu et al. 2021). 
Lin et al. (2019) investigated different scenarios on trade restrictions 
and found that a scenario with significant trade barriers based on 
additional 25% of tariffs would reduce global CO 2 emissions by 6.3% 
and GDP by 9.0%. On the other hand, the free trade scenario would 
increase global export volume by 5.4% and global CO 2 emissions 
by 1.2% for the base year of 2014 because of enhanced global 
production, especially in developing regions with high emissions 
intensities (Lin et al. 2019). It seems, however, that increased global 
GHG emissions only occur when the free trade agreements are 
between developed and developing countries (Nemati et al. 2019) because emissions reductions in the former group are counteracted 
by higher increases in the latter group of countries (Yao et al. 2019). 
In contrast, one study suggests that international trade avoided 

compared to a hypothetical situation without trade (López et  al. 
2018). Zhu and Jiang (2019) found that the recent slowdown in 
globalisation from 2012 to 2016 did not lower but instead increased 
global CO 2 emissions by 202 Mt. This is because the consumption 
of domestic intermediate and final products increased in many 
countries, in particular in China and India, leading to increased 
domestic and therefore global CO 2 emissions (Mi et al. 2017; Guan 
et al. 2018; Khochiani and Nademi 2019; Liu et al. 2019; Wang and 
Jiang 2019; Zheng et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2020c). Partly, this is due 
to the fact that non-OECD countries have a higher emissions intensity 
than OECD economies at the aggregate level (Zhu and Jiang 2019; 
González-Torres et al. 2021). Scenario modelling of the USA-China 
trade war in 2018–2019 showed an increase in global CO 2 emissions, 
despite a decrease in global economic output (Lu et al. 2020). This was 
because the modelled change in trade patterns as a consequence of 
the trade war meant that increased emissions from land-use changes 
and higher production in some countries far exceeded the reductions 
through structural effects in other countries (Lu et al. 2020).
In summary, there is low agreement and limited evidence on how 
international trade influences global GHG emissions. Since the 
pricing of energy resources and GHG emissions is inconsistent 
across countries, the overall outcome of trade on global emissions 
is coincidental rather than by design. If shifts in production are 
accompanied by large-scale transfers of and investment in low-
carbon technologies in carbon-intensive countries, the effects of 
trade on emissions can be mitigated (Jiang and Green 2017; Gozgor 
et  al. 2020). While such investments and knowledge transfers are 
more likely to come from net importing nations leading in low-carbon 
technology, net exporters can help by targeting carbon-intensive 
export industries with additional mitigation measures (Ren et  al. 
2014; Liu et al. 2015b; Ji et al. 2017). Section 13.7 of this report deals 
with international interactions of national mitigation policies.Emissions Trends and Drivers Chapter 2 Supplementary Material

for 1990–2019. GHG emissions from international aviation and shipping are not assigned to individual countries and shown separately. Panels (b) and (c): Changes in GHG 
emissions for the 20 largest emitters (as of 2019) for 1990–2019 in relative (% annual change) and absolute terms (GtCO 2-eq). Panels (d) and (e): GHG emissions per capita 
and per unit of GDP in 2019 for the 20 largest emitters (as of 2019). GDP estimated using constant international purchasing power parity (USD2017). Emissions are converted 
into CO 2-equivalents based on global warming potential with a 100-year time horizon (GWP100) from IPCC’s AR6 (Forster et al. 2021). The yellow dots represent the emissions 
data from UNFCCC-CRFs (2021) that were accessed through Gütschow et al. (2021a). Net LULUCF CO 2 emissions are included in panel (a), based on the average of three 
bookkeeping models (Chapter 2, Section 2.2), but are excluded in panels (b) to (e) due to a lack of country resolution.Chapter 2 Supplementary Material Emissions Trends and Drivers2SM

Executive Summary
Chapter 3 assesses the emissions pathways literature in order 
to identify their key characteristics (both in commonalities and 
differences) and to understand how societal choices may steer 
the system into a particular direction (high confidence). More 
than 2000 quantitative emissions pathways were submitted to the 
IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report AR6 scenarios database, out of which 

associated warming consistent with WGI. Five Illustrative Mitigation 
Pathways (IMPs) were selected, each emphasising a different scenario 
element as its defining feature: heavy reliance on renewables (IMP-
Ren), strong emphasis on energy demand reductions (IMP-LD), 
extensive use of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) in the energy and 
the industry sectors to achieve net negative emissions (IMP-Neg), 
mitigation in the context of broader sustainable development (IMP-
SP), and the implications of a less rapid and gradual strengthening of 
near-term mitigation actions (IMP-GS). {3.2, 3.3}
Pathways consistent with the implementation and 
extrapolation of countries’ implemented policies until the end 
of 2020 see greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reaching 54–

leading to a median global warming of 2.2°C to 3.5°C by 2100 
(medium confidence). These pathways consider policies at the time 
that they were developed. The Shared Socio-economic Pathways 
(SSPs) permit a more systematic assessment of future GHG emissions 
and their uncertainties than was possible in AR5. The main emissions 
drivers include growth in population, reaching  8.5–9.7 billion by 
2050, and an increase in global GDP of 2.7–4.1% per year between 

climate policies is projected to grow to around 480–750 EJ yr–1 in 

highest emissions scenarios in the literature result in global warming 
of >5°C by 2100, based on assumptions of rapid economic growth 
and pervasive climate policy failures (high confidence). {3.3} 
Many pathways in the literature show how to limit global 
warming compared to pre-industrial times to 2°C (>67%) with 
no overshoot or to limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or 
limited overshoot. The likelihood of limiting warming to 1.5°C 
with no or limited overshoot has dropped in AR6 compared 
to the Special Report on Global Warming of  1.5°C (SR1.5) 
because global GHG emissions have risen since the time SR1.5 
was published, leading to higher near-term emissions (2030) 
and higher cumulative CO 2 emissions until the time of net zero 
(medium confidence). Only a small number of published pathways 
limit global warming to 1.5°C without overshoot over the course of 
the 21st century. {3.3, Annex III.II.3}

a given level. Modelled pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) based on immediate action are summarised in category C3a in Table SPM.2. All assessed modelled 
global pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot assume immediate action as defined here (Category C1 in Table SPM.2).


action1 to limit warming to 2°C (>67%) are associated with 
net global GHG emissions of 30–49 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 by 2030 
and 14–26 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 by 2050 (medium confidence). This 
corresponds to reductions, relative to 2019 levels, of 13–45% by 

below 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot require a further acceleration 
in the pace of the transformation, with net GHG emissions typically 
around 21–36 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 by 2030 and 1–15 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 by 
2050; thus, reductions of 34–60% by 2030 and 73–98% by 2050 
relative to 2019 levels. {3.3}
Pathways following Nationally Determined Contributions 
(NDCs) announced prior to COP262 until 2030 reach annual 
emissions of 47–57 GtCO 2-eq by 2030, thereby making it 
impossible to limit warming to  1.5°C with no or limited 
overshoot and strongly increasing the challenge to limit 
warming to 2°C (>67%) (high confidence). A  high overshoot 
of  1.5°C increases the risks from climate impacts and increases 
the dependence on large-scale carbon dioxide removal from the 
atmosphere. A  future consistent with NDCs announced prior to 
COP26 implies higher fossil fuel deployment and lower reliance on 
low-carbon alternatives until 2030, compared to mitigation pathways 
with immediate action to limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower. To 
limit warming to 2°C (>67%) after following the NDCs to 2030, the 
pace of global GHG emission reductions would need to accelerate 
rapidly from 2030 onward: to an average of 1.4–2.0 GtCO 2-eq yr–1  
between 2030 and 2050, which is around two-thirds of the global 
CO2 emission reductions in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
and around 70% faster than in immediate action pathways  that 
limit warming to 2°C (>67%). Accelerating emission reductions after 
following an NDC pathway to 2030 would be particularly challenging 
because of the continued buildup of fossil fuel infrastructure that 
would be expected to take place between now and 2030. {3.5, 4.2}
Pathways accelerating actions compared to NDCs announced 
prior to COP26 that reduce annual GHG emissions to 

projected emissions from fully implementing NDCs announced 
prior to COP26, reduce the mitigation challenge for limiting 
warming to 2°C (>67%) after 2030 (medium confidence).  
The accelerated action pathways are characterised by a  global, 
but regionally differentiated, roll out of regulatory and  pricing 
policies. Compared to NDCs, they see less fossil fuels  and more 
low-carbon fuels until 2030, and narrow, but do not close the gap 
to pathways assuming immediate global action using all available 
least-cost abatement options. All delayed or accelerated action 
pathways  that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) converge to a global 
mitigation regime at some point after 2030 by putting a significant 
value on reducing carbon and other GHG emissions in all sectors 
and regions. {3.5}
Mitigation pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with 
no or limited overshoot reach 50% reductions of CO 2 in the 
2030s, relative to 2019, then reduce emissions further to 
reach net zero CO 2 emissions in the 2050s. Pathways  limiting 
warming to 2°C (>67%) reach 50% reductions in the 2040s 
and net zero CO 2 by 2070s (medium confidence). {3.3, Cross-
Chapter Box 3 in this chapter}
Peak warming in mitigation pathways is determined by the 
cumulative net CO 2 emissions until the time of net zero CO 2 and 
the warming contribution of other GHGs and climate forcers 
at that time (high confidence). Cumulative net CO 2 emissions 
from 2020 to the time of net zero CO 2 are 510 (330–710) GtCO 2 
in pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited 
overshoot and 890 (640–1160) GtCO 2 in pathways limiting warming 
to 2°C (>67%). These estimates are consistent with the assessment 
of remaining carbon budgets by WGI after adjusting for differences 
in peak warming levels. {3.3, Box 3.4}
Rapid reductions in non-CO 2 GHGs, particularly methane, 
would lower the level of peak warming (high confidence). 
Residual non-CO 2 emissions at the time of reaching net zero 
CO2 range between 5 and 11 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 in pathways limiting 
warming to 2°C   (>67%) or lower. Methane (CH 4) is reduced by 
around 19% (4–46%) in 2030 and 45% (29–64%) in 2050, relative 
to 2019. Methane emission reductions in pathways limiting warming 
to  1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot are substantially 
higher by 2030, 34% (21–57%), but only moderately so by 2050, 
51% (35–70%). Methane emissions reductions are thus attainable 
at relatively lower GHG prices but are at the same time limited in 
scope in most  1.5°C–2°C pathways. Deeper methane emissions 
reductions by 2050 could further constrain the peak warming. N 2O 
emissions are reduced too, but similar to CH 4, emission reductions 
saturate for more stringent climate goals. In the mitigation pathways, 
the emissions of cooling aerosols are reduced due to reduced use of 
fossil fuels. The overall impact on non-CO 2-related warming combines 
these factors. {3.3}
Net zero GHG emissions imply net negative CO 2 emissions at 
a level compensating residual non-CO 2 emissions. Only 30% of 
the pathways limiting warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower reach 
net zero GHG emissions in the 21st century (high confidence). 
In those pathways reaching net zero GHGs, it is achieved around 

The reported quantity of residual non-CO 2 emissions depends on 
accounting: the choice of GHG metric. Reaching and sustaining global 
net zero GHG emissions, measured in terms of GWP-100, results in 
a gradual decline of temperature (high confidence). {Cross-Chapter 
Box 2 in Chapter 2, 3.3, Cross-Chapter Box 3 in this chapter}
Pathways limiting warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower exhibit 
substantial reductions in emissions from all sectors (high 
confidence). Projected CO 2 emissions reductions between 2019 
and 2050 in 1.5°C (>50%) pathways with no or limited overshoot 
are around 77% (31–96%) for energy demand, 115% (90–167%) 
for energy supply, and 148% (94–387%) for agriculture, forestry 
and other land use (AFOLU). In pathways limiting warming to 2°C (>67%), projected CO 2 emissions are reduced between 2019 and 

136% for AFOLU (medium confidence). {3.4}
Delaying or sacrificing emissions reductions in one sector 
or region involves compensating reductions in other sectors or 
regions if warming is to be limited (high confidence). Mitigation 
pathways show differences in the timing of decarbonisation and 
when net zero CO 2 emissions are achieved across sectors and 
regions. At the time of global net zero CO 2 emissions, emissions in 
some sectors and regions are positive while others are negative; 
the ordering depends on the mitigation options available, the cost 
of those options, and the policies implemented. In cost-effective 
mitigation pathways, the energy-supply sector typically reaches net 
zero CO 2 before the economy as a whole, while the demand sectors 
reach net zero CO 2 later, if ever (high confidence). {3.4}
Pathways limiting warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower involve 
substantial reductions in fossil fuel consumption and a near 
elimination of the use of coal without carbon capture and 
storage (CCS) (high confidence). These pathways show an increase 
in low-carbon energy, with 88% (69–97%) of primary energy coming 
from these sources by 2100. {3.4}
Stringent emissions reductions at the level required for 
2°C (>67%) or lower are achieved through increased direct 
electrification of buildings, transport, and industry, resulting 
in increased electricity generation in all pathways (high 
confidence). Nearly all electricity in pathways limiting warming to 
2°C (>67%) or lower is from low- or no-carbon technologies, with 
different shares of nuclear, biomass, non-biomass renewables, and 
fossil CCS across pathways. {3.4}
The measures required to limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or 
lower can result in large-scale transformation of the land 
surface (high confidence). Pathways limiting warming to 2°C 
(>67%) or lower are projected to reach net zero CO 2 emissions in 
the AFOLU sector between the 2020s and 2070, with an increase of 
forest cover of about 322 million ha (–67 to 890 million ha) in 2050 
in pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited 
overshoot. Cropland area to supply biomass for bioenergy (including 
bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  – BECCS) is around 

to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot. The use of bioenergy 
can lead to either increased or reduced emissions, depending on the 
scale of deployment, conversion technology, fuel displaced, and how/
where the biomass is produced (high confidence). {3.4}
Anthropogenic land CO 2 emissions and removals in Integrated 
Assessment Model (IAM) pathways cannot be directly 
compared with those reported in national GHG inventories 
(high confidence). Methodologies enabling a  more like-for-like 
comparison between models’ and countries’ approaches would 
support more accurate assessment of the collective progress achieved 
under the Paris Agreement. {3.4, 7.2.2.5} 
Pathways that  limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower involve 
some amount of CDR to compensate for residual GHG  emissions 
remaining after substantial direct emissions reductions in all 
sectors and regions (high confidence). CDR deployment in 
pathways serves multiple purposes: accelerating the pace of emissions 
reductions, offsetting residual emissions, and creating the option for 
net negative CO 2 emissions in case temperature reductions need to 
be achieved in the long term (high confidence). CDR options in the 
pathways are mostly limited to BECCS, afforestation and direct air 
carbon capture and storage (DACCS). CDR through some measures in 
AFOLU can be maintained for decades but not in the very long term 
because these sinks will ultimately saturate (high confidence). {3.4} 
Mitigation pathways show reductions in energy demand 
relative to reference scenarios, through a  diverse set of 
demand-side interventions (high confidence). Bottom-up 
and non-IAM studies show significant potential for demand-side 
mitigation. A stronger emphasis on demand-side mitigation implies 
less dependence on CDR and, consequently, reduced pressure on 
land and biodiversity. {3.4, 3.7}
Limiting warming requires shifting energy investments away 
from fossil fuels and towards low-carbon technologies (high 
confidence). The bulk of investments are needed in medium- and 
low-income regions. Investment needs in the electricity sector are on 
average 2.3 trillion USD2015 yr–1 over 2023 to 2052 for pathways 
that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot, 
and 1.7 trillion USD2015 yr–1 for pathways that limit warming to 2°C 
(>67%). {3.6.1}
Pathways limiting warming to 2°C (>67%) require more rapid 
near-term transformations and are associated with higher 
upfront transition costs, but meanwhile bring long-term gains 
for the economy as well as earlier benefits in avoided climate 
change impacts (high confidence). This conclusion is independent 
of the discount rate applied, though the modelled cost-optimal 
balance of mitigation action over time does depend on the discount 
rate. Lower discount rates favour earlier mitigation, reducing reliance 
on CDR and temperature overshoot. {3.6.1, 3.8}
Mitigation pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) entail 
losses in global GDP with respect to reference scenarios 
of between  1.3% and  2.7% in 2050; and in pathways that 
limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot, 
losses are between  2.6% and  4.2%. Yet, these estimates do 
not account for the economic benefits of avoided climate 
change impacts (medium confidence). In mitigation pathways 
that limit warming to 2°C (>67%), marginal abatement costs 
of carbon are about 90  (60–120) USD2015 tCO 2 in 2030 and 
about 210 (140–340) USD2015 tCO 2 in 2050; in pathways that 
limit warming to  1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot, 
they are about 220 (170–290) USD2015 tCO 2 in 2030 and about 


(>67%) outweigh global mitigation costs over the 21st century, 
if aggregated economic impacts of climate change are at the 
moderate to high end of the assessed range, and a  weight 
consistent with economic theory is given to economic impacts 
over the long term. This holds true even without accounting for 
benefits in other sustainable development dimensions or non-
market damages from climate change (medium confidence). 
The aggregate global economic repercussions of mitigation 
pathways include the macroeconomic impacts of investments in 
low-carbon solutions and structural changes away from emitting 
activities, co-benefits and adverse side effects of mitigation, 
(avoided) climate change impacts, and (reduced) adaptation costs. 
Existing quantifications of global aggregate economic impacts show 
a strong dependence on socio-economic development conditions, as 
these shape exposure and vulnerability and adaptation opportunities 
and responses. (Avoided) impacts for poorer households and 
poorer countries represent a  smaller share in aggregate economic 
quantifications expressed in GDP or monetary terms, whereas their 
well-being and welfare effects are comparatively larger. When 
aggregate economic benefits from avoided climate change impacts 
are accounted for, mitigation is a welfare-enhancing strategy (high 
confidence). {3.6.2}
The economic benefits on human health from air quality 
improvement arising from mitigation action can be of the 
same order of magnitude as mitigation costs, and potentially 
even larger (medium confidence). {3.6.3}
Differences between aggregate employment in mitigation 
pathways compared to reference scenarios are relatively 
small, although there may be substantial reallocations across 
sectors, with job creation in some sectors and job losses in 
others (medium confidence). The net employment effect (and its 
sign) depends on scenario assumptions, modelling framework, and 
modelled policy design. Mitigation has implications for employment 
through multiple channels, each of which impacts geographies, 
sectors and skill categories differently (medium confidence). {3.6.4}
The economic repercussions of mitigation vary widely across 
regions and households, depending on policy design and level 
of international cooperation (high confidence). Delayed global 
cooperation increases policy costs across regions, especially in those 
that are relatively carbon intensive at present (high confidence). 
Pathways with uniform carbon values show higher mitigation costs 
in more carbon-intensive regions, in fossil fuel exporting regions 
and in poorer regions (high confidence). Aggregate quantifications 
expressed in GDP or monetary terms undervalue the economic effects 
on households in poorer countries; the actual effects on welfare and 
well-being are comparatively larger (high confidence). Mitigation 
at the speed and scale required to limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or 
lower implies deep economic and structural changes, thereby raising 
multiple types of distributional concerns across regions, income 
classes and sectors (high confidence). {3.6.1, 3.6.4}
The timing of mitigation actions and their effectiveness 
will have significant consequences for broader sustainable 
development outcomes in the longer term (high confidence). 
Ambitious mitigation can be considered a precondition for achieving 
the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially for vulnerable 
populations and ecosystems with little capacity to adapt to climate 
impacts. Dimensions with anticipated co-benefits include health, 
especially regarding air pollution, clean energy access and water 
availability. Dimensions with potential trade-offs include food, 
employment, water stress, and biodiversity, which come under 
pressure from large-scale CDR deployment, energy affordability/
access, and mineral-resource extraction (high confidence). {3.7}
Many of the potential trade-offs of mitigation measures 
for other sustainable development outcomes depend on 
policy design and can thus be compensated or avoided with 
additional policies and investments or through policies that 
integrate mitigation with other SDGs (high confidence). 
Targeted SDG policies and investments, for example in the areas 
of healthy nutrition, sustainable consumption and production, and 
international collaboration, can support climate change mitigation 
policies and resolve or alleviate trade-offs. Trade-offs can be addressed 
by complementary policies and investments, as well as through the 
design of cross-sectoral policies integrating mitigation with 
the Sustainable Development Goals of health, nutrition, sustainable 
consumption and production, equity and biodiversity. {3.7}
Decent living standards, which encompass many SDG 
dimensions, are achievable at lower energy use than previously 
thought (high confidence). Mitigation strategies that focus on 
lower demands for energy and land-based resources exhibit reduced 
trade-offs and negative consequences for sustainable development 
relative to pathways involving either high emissions and climate 
impacts or those with high consumption and emissions that are 
ultimately compensated by large quantities of BECCS. {3.7}
Different mitigation pathways are associated with different 
feasibility challenges, though appropriate enabling conditions 
can reduce these challenges (high confidence). Feasibility 
challenges are transient and concentrated in the next two to 
three decades (high confidence).   They are multidimensional, 
context-dependent and malleable to policy, technological and 
societal trends. {3.8} 
Mitigation pathways are associated with significant 
institutional and economic feasibility challenges rather than 
technological and geophysical feasibility challenges (medium 
confidence). The rapid pace of technological development and 
deployment in mitigation pathways is not incompatible with 
historical records. Institutional capacity is rather a key limiting factor 
for a successful transition. Emerging economies appear to have the 
highest feasibility challenges in the short to medium term. {3.8} 
Pathways relying on a broad portfolio of mitigation strategies 
are more robust and resilient (high confidence). Portfolios of 
technological solutions reduce the feasibility risks associated with 
the low-carbon transition. {3.8}
3.1 Introduction
3.1.1 Assessment of Mitigation Pathways and 
Their Compatibility With Long-term Goals
Chapter 3 takes a long-term perspective on climate change mitigation 
pathways. Its focus is on the implications of long-term targets for the 
required short- and medium-term system changes and associated 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This focus dictates a more global 
view and on issues related to path-dependency and up-scaling 
of mitigation options necessary to achieve different emissions 
trajectories, including particularly deep mitigation pathways that 
require rapid and fundamental changes.
Stabilising global average-temperature change requires reducing 
CO2 emissions to net zero. Thus, a central cross-cutting topic within 
the chapter is the timing of reaching net zero CO 2 emissions and 
how a  ‘balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources 
and removals by sinks’ could be achieved across time and space. This 
includes particularly the increasing body of literature since the IPCC 
Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5) which focuses on 
net zero CO 2 emissions pathways that avoid temperature overshoot 
and hence do not rely on net negative CO 2 emissions. The chapter 
conducts a systematic assessment of the associated economic costs 
as well as the benefits of mitigation for other societal objectives, 
such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In addition, the 
chapter builds on SR1.5 and introduces a new conceptual framing for 
the assessment of possible social, economic, technical, political, and 
geophysical ‘feasibility’ concerns of alternative pathways, including 
the enabling conditions that would need to fall into place so that 
stringent climate goals become attainable.
The structure of the chapter is as follows: Section  3.2 introduces 
different types of mitigation pathways as well as the available 
modelling. Section 3.3 explores different emissions trajectories given 
socio-economic uncertainties and consistent with different long-term 
climate outcomes. A central element in this section is the systematic 
categorisation of the scenario space according to key characteristics of 
the mitigation pathways (including e.g., global average-temperature 
change, socio-economic development, technology assumptions, etc.). 
In addition, the section introduces selected Illustrative Mitigation 
Pathways (IMPs) that are used across the whole report. Section 3.4 
conducts a sectoral analysis of the mitigation pathways, assessing 
the pace and direction of systems changes across sectors. Among 
others, this section aims at the integration of the sectoral information 
across AR6 WGIII chapters through a comparative assessment of the 
sectoral dynamics in economy-wide systems models compared to 
the insights from bottom-up sectoral models (from Chapters 6 to 11). 
Section 3.5 focuses on the required timing of mitigation actions, and 
the implication of near-term choices for the attainability of a range 
of long-term climate goals. After having explored the underlying 
systems transitions and the required timing of the mitigation actions, 
Section 3.6 assesses the economic implications, mitigation costs and 
benefits; and Section  3.7 assesses related co-benefits, synergies, 
and possible trade-offs for sustainable development and other 
societal (non-climate) objectives. Section 3.8 assumes a central role 
in the chapter and introduces a multidimensional feasibility metric that permits the evaluation of mitigation pathways across a range 
of feasibility concerns. Finally, methods of the assessment and 
knowledge gaps are discussed in Section 3.9, followed by Frequently 
Asked Questions (FAQs).
3.1.2 Linkages to Other Chapters in the Report
Chapter 3 is linked to many other chapters in the report. The most 
important connections exist with Chapter  4 on mitigation and 
development pathways in the near to mid-term; with the sectoral 
chapters (Chapters  6–11); with the chapters dealing with cross-
cutting issues (Chapters 12 and 17, e.g., feasibility); and finally also 
with AR6 WGI and WGII.
Within the overall framing of the AR6 report, Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 
provide important complementary views of the required systems 
transitions across different temporal and spatial scales. While 
Chapter 3 focuses on the questions concerning the implications of the 
long-term objectives for the medium-to-near-term transformations, 
Chapter 4 comes from the other direction, and focuses on current 
near-term trends and policies (such as the Nationally Determined 
Contributions  – NDCs) and their consequences with regards to 
GHG emissions. The latter chapter naturally focuses much more 
on the regional and national dimensions, and the heterogeneity of 
current and planned policies. Bringing together the information from 
these two chapters enables the assessment of whether current and 
planned actions are consistent with the required systems changes for 
the long-term objectives of the Paris Agreement.
Important other linkages comprise the collaboration with the 
‘sectoral’ Chapters 6 to 11 to provide an integrated cross-sectoral 
perspective. This information (including information also from 
the sectoral chapters) is taken up ultimately also by Chapter 5 on 
demand/services and Chapter 12 for a further assessment of sectoral 
potential and costs.
Linkages to other chapters exist also on the topic of feasibility, which 
are informed by the policy, the sectoral and the demand chapters, 
the technology and finance chapters, as well as Chapter  4 on 
national circumstances.
Close collaboration with WGI permitted the use of AR6-calibrated 
emulators, which assure full consistency across the different 
working groups. Linkages to WGII concern the assessment of 
macroeconomic benefits of avoided impacts that are put into the 
context of mitigation costs as well as co-benefits and trade-offs for 
sustainable development.
3.1.3 Complementary Use of Large Scenario Ensembles 
and a Limited Set of Illustrative Mitigation 
Pathways (IMPs)
The assessment of mitigation pathways explores a  wide scenario 
space from the literature within which seven Illustrative Pathways 
(IPs) are explored. The overall process is indicated in Figure 3.5a.
For a comprehensive assessment, a large ensemble of scenarios is 
collected and made available through an interactive AR6 Scenarios 
Database4. The collected information is shared across the chapters of 
AR6 and includes more than 3000 different pathways from a diverse 
set of studies. After an initial screening and quality control, scenarios 
were further vetted to assess if they sufficiently represented historical 
trends (Annex III.II.3.1). Subsequently, the climate consequences of 
each scenario were assessed using the climate emulator (leading to 
further classification). The assessment in Chapter 3 is, however, not 
limited to the scenarios from the database, and wherever necessary 
other literature sources are also assessed in order to bring together 
multiple lines of evidence.
In parallel, based on the overall AR6 assessment, seven illustrative 
pathways (IP) were defined representing critical mitigation strategies 
discussed in the assessment. The seven pathways are composed of 
two sets: (i) one set of five Illustrative Mitigation Pathways (IMPs) and 
(ii) one set of two reference pathways illustrative for high emissions. 
The IMPs are on the one hand representative of the scenario spac but 
also help to communicate archetypes of distinctly different systems 
transformations and related policy choices. Subsequently, seven 
scenarios were selected from the full database that fitted these 
storylines of each IP best. For these scenarios more strict vetting 
criteria were applied. The selection was done by first applying specific 
filters based on the storyline followed by a final selection (Box 3.1 
and Figure 3.5a).
3.2 Which Mitigation Pathways are 
Compatible With Long-term Goals?
3.2.1 Scenario and Emission Pathways
Scenario and emission pathways are used to explore possible 
long-term trajectories, the effectiveness of possible mitigation 
strategies, and to help understand key uncertainties about the 
future. A  scenario is an integrated description of a possible future 
of the human–environment system (Clarke et al. 2014), and could 
be a qualitative narrative, quantitative projection, or both. Scenarios 

forces such as population, GDP , technology, lifestyles, and policy, and 
the consequences on energy use, land use, and emissions. Scenarios 
are not predictions or forecasts. An emission pathway is a modelled 
trajectory of anthropogenic emissions (Rogelj et al. 2018a) and, 
therefore, a part of a scenario.
There is no unique or preferred method to develop scenarios, and 
future pathways can be developed from diverse methods, depending 
on user needs and research questions (Turnheim et al. 2015; 
Trutnevyte et al. 2019a; Hirt et al. 2020). The most comprehensive 
scenarios in the literature are qualitative narratives that are translated 
into quantitative pathways using models (Clarke et al. 2014; Rogelj 
et al. 2018a). Schematic or illustrative pathways can also be used 
to communicate specific features of more complex scenarios (Allen 
et al. 2018). Simplified models can be used to explain the mechanisms 
operating in more complex models (e.g.,  Emmerling et al. 2019). 
Ultimately, a diversity of scenario and modelling approaches can lead 
to more robust findings (Schinko et al. 2017; Gambhir et al. 2019).
3.2.1.1 Reference Scenarios
It is common to define a reference scenario (also called a baseline 
scenario). Depending on the research question, a reference scenario 
could be defined in different ways (Grant et al. 2020): (i) a hypothetical 
world with no climate policies or climate impacts (Kriegler 
et al. 2014b), (ii) assuming current policies or pledged policies are 
implemented (Roelfsema et al. 2020), or (iii) a mitigation scenario 
to compare sensitivity with other mitigation scenarios (Kriegler et al. 
2014a; Sognnaes et al. 2021).
No-climate-policy reference scenarios have often been compared 
with mitigation scenarios (Clarke et al. 2014). A  no-climate-policy 
scenario assumes that no future climate policies are implemented, 
beyond what is in the model calibration, effectively implying that 
the carbon price is zero. No-climate-policy reference scenarios 
have a  broad range depending on socio-economic assumptions 
and model characteristics, and consequently are important when 
assessing mitigation costs (Riahi et al. 2017; Rogelj et al. 2018b). As 
Box 3.1 | Illustrative Mitigation Pathways (IMPs)
The literature shows a wide range of possible emissions trajectories, depicting developments in the absence of new climate policies or 
showing pathways consistent with the Paris Agreement. From the literature, a set of five Illustrative Mitigation Pathways (IMPs) was 
selected to denote implications of choices on socio-economic development and climate policies, and the associated transformations of 
the main GHG-emitting sectors (Figure 3.5b). The IMPs include a set of transformative pathways that illustrate how choices may lead 
to distinctly different transformations that may keep temperature increase to below 2°C (>67%) or 1.5°C. These pathways illustrate 
the implications of a focus on renewable energy such as solar and wind; reduced energy demand; extensive use of CDR in the energy 
and the industry sectors to achieve net negative emissions and reliance on other supply-side measures; strategies that avoid net 
negative carbon emissions, and gradual strengthening. In addition, one IMP explores how climate policies consistent with keeping 
limit warming to 1.5C (>50%) can be combined with a broader shift towards sustainable development. These IMPs are used in various 
chapters, exploring for instance their implications for different sectors, regions, and innovation characteristics (Figure 3.5b).
countries move forward with climate policies of varying stringency,  
no-climate-policy baselines are becoming increasingly hypothetical 
(Hausfather and Peters 2020). Studies clearly show current policies 
are having an effect, particularly when combined with the declining 
costs of low-carbon technologies (IEA 2020a; Roelfsema et al. 2020; 
Sognnaes et al. 2021; UNEP 2020), and, consequently, realised 
trajectories begin to differ from earlier no-climate-policy scenarios 
(Burgess et al. 2020). High-end emission scenarios, such as RCP8.5 and 
SSP5-8.5, are becoming less likely with climate policy and technology 
change (Box  3.3), but high-end concentration and warming levels 
may still be reached with the inclusion of strong carbon or climate 
feedbacks (Hausfather and Peters 2020; Pedersen et al. 2020).
3.2.1.2 Mitigation Scenarios
Mitigation scenarios explore different strategies to meet climate goals 
and are typically derived from reference scenarios by adding climate 
or other policies. Mitigation pathways are often developed to meet 
a predefined level of climate change, often referred to as a backcast. 
There are relatively few IAMs that include an endogenous climate 
model or emulator due to the added computational complexity, 
though exceptions do exist. In practice, models implement climate 
constraints by either iterating carbon-price assumptions (Strefler 
et al. 2021b) or by adopting an associated carbon budget (Riahi 
et al. 2021). In both cases, other GHGs are typically controlled by 
CO2-equivalent pricing. A large part of the AR5 literature has focused 
on forcing pathways towards a target at the end of the century (van 
Vuuren et al. 2007, 2011; Clarke et al. 2009; Blanford et al. 2014; Riahi 
et al. 2017), featuring a  temporary overshoot of the warming and 
forcing levels (Geden and Löschel 2017). In comparison, many recent 
studies explore mitigation strategies that limit overshoot (Johansson 
et al. 2020; Riahi et al. 2021). An increasing number of IAM studies 
also explore climate pathways that limit adverse side effects with 
respect to other societal objectives, such as food security (van Vuuren 
et al. 2019; Riahi et al. 2021) or larger sets of sustainability objectives 
(Soergel et al. 2021a).
3.2.2 The Utility of Integrated Assessment Models
Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are critical for understanding 
the implications of long-term climate objectives for the required 
near-term transition. For doing so, an integrated systems perspective 
including the representation of all sectors and GHGs is necessary. 
IAMs are used to explore the response of complex systems in a formal 
and consistent framework. They cover a broad range of modelling 
frameworks (Keppo et al. 2021). Given the complexity of the systems 
under investigation, IAMs necessarily make simplifying assumptions 
and therefore results need to be interpreted in the context of these 
assumptions. IAMs can range from economic models that consider 
only carbon dioxide emissions through to detailed process-based 
representations of the global energy system, covering separate 
regions and sectors (such as energy, transport, and land use), all GHG 
emissions and air pollutants, interactions with land and water, and 
a reduced representation of the climate system. IAMs are generally 
driven by economics and can have a variety of characteristics such as 
partial-, general- or non-equilibrium; myopic or perfect foresight; be based on optimisation or simulation; have exogenous or endogenous 
technological change amongst many other characteristics. IAMs take 
as input socio-economic and technical variables and parameters 
to represent various systems. There is no unique way to integrate 
this knowledge into a model, and due to their complexity, various 
simplifications and omissions are made for tractability. IAMs 
therefore have various advantages and disadvantages which need 
to be weighed up when interpreting IAM outcomes. Annex  III.I 
contains an overview of the different types of models and their 
key characteristics.
Most IAMs are necessarily broad as they capture long-term dynamics. 
IAMs are strong in showing the key characteristics of emission 
pathways and are most suited to questions related to short- versus 
long-term trade-offs, key interactions with non-climate objectives, 
long-term energy and land-use characteristics, and implications of 
different overarching technological and policy choices (Clarke et al. 
2014; Rogelj et al. 2018a). While some IAMs have a  high level of 
regional and sectoral detail, for questions that require higher levels 
of granularity (e.g., local policy implementation) specific region and 
sector models may be better suited. Utility of the IAM pathways 
increases when the quantitative results are contextualized through 
qualitative narratives or other additional types of knowledge 
to provide deeper insights (Geels et al. 2016a; Weyant 2017; 
Gambhir et al. 2019).
IAMs have a  long history in addressing environmental 
problems, particularly in the IPCC assessment process (van Beek 
et al. 2020). Many policy discussions have been guided by IAM-based 
quantifications, such as the required emission reduction rates, net 
zero years, or technology deployment rates required to meet certain 
climate outcomes. This has led to the discussion about whether IAM 
scenarios have become performative, meaning that they act upon, 
transform or bring into being the scenarios they describe (Beck and 
Mahony 2017, 2018). Transparency of underlying data and methods 
is critical for scenario users to understand what drives different 
scenario results (Robertson 2020). A number of community activities 
have thus focused on the provision of transparent and publicly 
accessible databases of both input and output data (Riahi et al. 2012; 
Huppmann et al. 2018; Krey et al. 2019; Daioglou et al. 2020), as well 
as the provision of open-source code, and increased documentation 
(Annex III.I.9). Transparency is needed to reveal conditionality of results 
on specific choices in terms of assumptions (e.g., discount rates) and 
model architecture. More detailed explanations of underlying model 
dynamics would be critical to increase the understanding of what 
drives results (Bistline et al. 2020; Butnar et al. 2020; Robertson 2020).
Mitigation scenarios developed for a  long-term climate constraint 
typically focus on cost-effective mitigation action towards a  long-
term climate goal. Results from IAM as well as sectoral models depend 
on model structure (Mercure et al. 2019), economic assumptions 
(Emmerling et al. 2019), technology assumptions (Pye et al. 2018), 
climate/emissions target formulation (Johansson et al. 2020), and 
the extent to which pre-existing market distortions are considered 
(Guivarch et al. 2011). The vast majority of IAM pathways do not 
consider climate impacts (Schultes et al. 2021). Equity hinges upon 
ethical and normative choices. As most IAM pathways follow the 
cost-effectiveness approach, they do not make any additional equity 
assumptions. Notable exceptions include Tavoni et al. (2015), Pan et al. 
(2017), van den Berg et al. (2020), and Bauer et al. (2020). Regional 
IAM results therefore need to be assessed with care, considering that 
emissions reductions are happening where it is most cost-effective, 
which needs to be separated from who is ultimately paying for 
the mitigation costs. Cost-effective pathways can provide a  useful 
benchmark, but may not reflect real-world developments (Calvin 
et al. 2014a; Trutnevyte 2016). Different modelling frameworks may 
lead to different outcomes (Mercure et al. 2019). Recent studies have 
shown that other desirable outcomes can evolve with only minor 
deviations from cost-effective pathways (Bauer et al. 2020; Neumann 
and Brown 2021). IAM and sectoral models represent social, political, 
and institutional factors only in a rudimentary way. This assessment is 
thus relying on new methods for the ex post assessment of feasibility 
concerns (Jewell and Cherp 2020; Brutschin et al. 2021). A literature is 
emerging that recognises and reflects on the diversity and strengths/
weaknesses of model-based scenario analysis (Keppo et al. 2021).
The climate constraint implementation can have a meaningful impact 
on model results. The literature so far includes many temperature 
overshoot scenarios with heavy reliance on long-term CDR and net 
negative CO 2 emissions to bring back temperatures after the peak 
(Rogelj et al. 2019b; Johansson et al. 2020). New approaches have 
been developed to avoid temperature overshoot. The new generation 
of scenarios show that CDR is important beyond its ability to reduce 
temperature, but is essential also for offsetting residual emissions to 
reach net zero CO 2 emissions (Rogelj et al. 2019b; Johansson et al. 
2020; Riahi et al. 2021; Strefler et al. 2021b).
Many factors influence the deployment of technologies in the 
IAMs. Since AR5, there has been fervent debate on the large-scale 
deployment of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) in 
scenarios (Fuss et al. 2014; Geden 2015; Anderson and Peters 2016; 
Smith et al. 2016; van Vuuren et al. 2017; Galik 2020; Köberle 2019). 
Hence, many recent studies explore mitigation pathways with limited 
BECCS deployment (Grubler et al. 2018; van Vuuren et al. 2019; 
Riahi et al. 2021; Soergel et al. 2021a). While some have argued that 
technology diffusion in IAMs occurs too rapidly (Gambhir et al. 2019), 
others argued that most models prefer large-scale solutions resulting 
in a  relatively slow phase-out of fossil fuels (Carton 2019). While 
IAMs are particularly strong on supply-side representation, demand-
side measures still lag in detail of representation despite progress 
since AR5 (Grubler et al. 2018; Lovins et al. 2019; van den Berg et al. 
2019;  O’Neill et al. 2020b; Hickel et al. 2021; Keyßer and Lenzen 
2021). The discount rate has a  significant impact on the balance 
between near-term and long-term mitigation. Lower discount rates 
<4% (than used in IAMs) may lead to more near-term emissions 
reductions – depending on the stringency of the target (Emmerling 
et al. 2019; Riahi et al. 2021). Models often use simplified policy 
assumptions (O’Neill et al. 2020b) which can affect the deployment 
of technologies (Sognnaes et al. 2021). Uncertainty in technologies 
can lead to more or less short-term mitigation (Grant et al. 2021; 
Bednar et al. 2021). There is also a recognition to put more emphasis 
on what drives the results of different IAMs (Gambhir et al. 2019) 
and suggestions to focus more on what is driving differences in result 
across IAMs (Nikas et al. 2021). As noted by Weyant (2017, p. 131), ‘IAms can provide very useful information, but this information needs 
to be carefully interpreted and integrated with other quantitative and 
qualitative inputs in the decision-making process.’
3.2.3 The Scenario Literature and Scenario Databases
IPCC reports have often used voluntary submissions to a  scenario 
database in its assessments. The database is an ensemble of opportunity, 
as there is not a well-designed statistical sampling of the hypothetical 
model or scenario space: the literature is unlikely to cover all possible 
models and scenarios, and not all scenarios in the literature are 
submitted to the database. Model intercomparisons are often the core 
of scenario databases assessed by the IPCC (Cointe et al. 2019; Nikas 
et al. 2021). Single-model studies may allow more detailed sensitivity 
analyses or address specific research questions. The scenarios that are 
organised within the scientific community are more likely to enter the 
assessment process via the scenario database (Cointe et al. 2019), 
while scenarios from different communities, in the emerging literature, 
or not structurally consistent with the database may be overlooked. 
Scenarios in the grey literature may not be assessed even though they 
may have greater weight in a policy context.
One notable development since AR5 is the Shared Socio-economic 
Pathways (SSPs), conceptually outlined in Moss et al. (2010) and 
subsequently developed to support integrated climate research across 
the IPCC Working Groups (O’Neill et al. 2014). Initially, a set of SSP 
narratives were developed, describing worlds with different challenges 
to mitigation and adaptation (O’Neill et al. 2017a): SSP1 (sustainability), 
SSP2 (middle of the road), SSP3 (regional rivalry), SSP4 (inequality) 
and SSP5 (rapid growth). The SSPs have now been quantified in terms 
of energy, land-use, and emission pathways (Riahi et al. 2017), for 
both no-climate-policy reference scenarios and mitigation scenarios 
that follow similar radiative-forcing pathways as the Representative 
Concentration Pathways (RCPs) assessed in AR5 WGI. Since then the 
SSPs have been successfully applied in thousands of studies (O’Neill 
et al. 2020b) including some critiques on the use and application of 
the SSP framework (Pielke and Ritchie 2021; Rosen 2021). A selection 
of the quantified SSPs are used prominently in AR6 WGI as they were 
the basis for most climate modelling since AR5 (O’Neill et al. 2016). 
Since 2014, when the first set of SSP data was made available, there 
has been a divergence between scenario and historic trends (Burgess 
et al. 2020). As a result, the SSPs require updating (O’Neill et al. 2020b). 
Most of the scenarios in the AR6 database are SSP-based and consider 
various updates compared to the first release (Riahi et al. 2017).
3.2.4 The AR6 Scenario Database
To facilitate this assessment, a  large ensemble of scenarios has 
been collected and made available through an interactive AR6 
WGIII scenario database. The collection of the scenario outputs 
is coordinated by Chapter  3 and expands upon the IPCC SR1.5 
scenario explorer (Huppmann et al. 2018; Rogelj et al. 2018a). 
A  complementary database for national pathways has been 
established by Chapter 4. Annex III.II.3 contains full details on how 
the scenario database was compiled.
The AR6 scenario database contains 3131 scenarios (Figure  3.5a). 
After an initial screening and quality control, scenarios were further 
vetted to assess if they sufficiently represented historical trends 
(Annex III.II.3.1). Of the initial 2266 scenarios with global scope, 

chapter. The scenarios that did not pass the vetting are still available in 
the database. The vetted scenarios were from over 50 different model 
families, or over 100 when considering all versions of the same family 
(Figure 3.1). The scenarios originated from over 15 different model intercomparison projects, with around one-fifth originating from 
individual studies (Figure 3.2). Because of the uneven distribution of 
scenarios from different models and projects, uncorrected statistics 
from the database can be misleading.
Each scenario with sufficient data is given a  temperature 
classification using climate model emulators. Three emulators were 
used in the assessment: FAIR (Smith et al. 2018), CICERO-SCM 
(Skeie et al. 2021), MAGICC (Meinshausen et al. 2020). Only the 300

a The Illustrative Mitigation Pathway ‘Neg’ has extensive use of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) in the AFOLU, energy and the industry sectors to achieve net negative 
emissions. Warming peaks around 2060 and declines to below 1.5°C (50% likelihood) shortly after 2100. Whilst technically classified as C3, it strongly exhibits the 
characteristics of C2 high-overshoot pathways, hence it has been placed in the C2 category. See Box SPM.1 for an introduction of the IPs and IMPs.
results of MAGICC are shown in this chapter as it adequately covers the 
range of outcomes. The emulators are calibrated against the behaviour 
of complex climate models and observation data, consistent with the 
outcomes of AR6 WGI (Cross-Chapter Box 7.1). The climate assessment 
is a three-step process of harmonisation, infilling and a probabilistic 
climate model emulator run (Annex  III.II.2.5). Warming projections 
until the year 2100 were derived for 1574 scenarios, of which 1202 
passed vetting, with the remaining scenarios having insufficient 
information (Figure 3.3 and Table 3.1). For scenarios that limit warming 
to 2°C or lower, the SR1.5 classification was adopted in AR6, with 
more disaggregation provided for higher warming levels (Table 3.1). These choices can be compared with the selection of common global 
warming levels (GWLs) of 1.5°C, 2°C, 3°C and 4°C to classify climate 
change impacts in the WGII assessment.
In addition to the temperature classification, each scenario is assigned 
to one of the following policy categories: (P0) diagnostic scenarios – 99 
of 1686 vetted scenarios; (P1) scenarios with no globally coordinated 
policy (500) and (P1a) no climate mitigation efforts  – 124, (P1b) 
current national mitigation efforts – 59, (P1c) Nationally Determined 
Contributions (NDCs) – 160, or (P1d) other non-standard assumptions –

matching on the scenario metadata and calibrated on the best-known 
scenarios from model intercomparisons, with further validation against 
the related literature, reported emission and carbon price trajectories, 
and exchanges with modellers. If the information available is enough 
to qualify a policy category number but not sufficient for a subcategory, 
then only the number is retained (e.g., P2 instead of P2a/b/c). A suffix 
added after P0 further qualifies a diagnostic scenario as one of the other 
policy categories. To demonstrate the diversity of the scenarios, the vetted 
scenarios were classified into different categories along the dimensions 
of population, GDP , energy, and cumulative emissions (Figure 3.4). The 
number of scenarios in each category provides some insight into the 
current literature, but this does not indicate a higher probability of that 
category occurring in reality. For population, the majority of scenarios 
are consistent with the SSP2 ‘middle of the road’ category, with very 
few scenarios exploring the outer extremes. GDP has a slightly larger 
variation, but overall most scenarios are around the SSP2 socio-
economic assumptions. The level of CCS and CDR is expected to change 
depending on the extent of mitigation, but there remains extensive use 
of both CDR and CCS in scenarios. CDR is dominated by bioenergy with 
CCS (BECCS) and sequestration on land, with relatively few scenarios 
using direct air capture with carbon storage (DACCS) and even less 
with enhanced weathering (EW) and other technologies (not shown). 
In terms of energy consumption, final energy has a much smaller range 
than primary energy as conversion losses are not included in final 
energy. Both mitigation and reference scenarios are shown, so there is 
a broad spread in different energy carriers represented in the database. 
Bioenergy has a number of scenarios at around 100 EJ, representing 
a constraint used in many model intercomparisons.
3.2.5 Illustrative Mitigation Pathways
Successive IPCC Assessment Reports (ARs) have used scenarios to 
illustrate key characteristics of possible climate (policy) futures. In AR5 
four RCPs made the basis of climate modelling in WGI and WGII, with 
WGIII assessing over 1000 scenarios spanning those RCPs (Clarke et al. 
2014). Of the over 400 scenarios assessed in SR1.5, four scenarios 
were selected to highlight the trade-off between short-term emission 
reductions and long-term deployment of BECCS (Rogelj et al. 2018a), 
referred to as ‘Illustrative Pathways’ (IPs). AR6 WGI and WGII rely on 
the scenarios selected for CMIP6, called ScenarioMIP (O’Neill et al. 
2016), to assess warming levels. In addition to the full set of scenarios, 
AR6 WGIII also uses selected Illustrative Mitigation Pathways (IMPs).
In WGIII, IMPs were selected to denote the implications of different 
societal choices for the development of future emissions and 
associated transformations of main GHG-emitting sectors (Figure 3.5a 
and Box 3.1). The most important function of the IMPs is to illustrate 
key themes that form a  common thread in the report, both with 
a storyline and a quantitative illustration. The storyline describes the key characteristics that define an IMP . The quantitative versions of 
the IMPs provide numerical values that are internally consistent and 
comparable across chapters of the report. The quantitative IMPs have 
been selected from the AR6 scenario database. No assessment of the 
likelihood of each IMP has been made.
The selected scenarios (IPs) are divided into two sets (Figures  3.5 
and 3.6): two reference pathways illustrative of high emissions and five 
Illustrative Mitigation Pathways (IMPs). The narratives are explained 
in full in Annex III.II.2.4. The two reference pathways explore the 
consequences of current policies and pledges: Current Policies (CurPol) 
and Moderate Action (ModAct). The CurPol pathway explores the 
consequences of continuing along the path of implemented climate 
policies in 2020 and only a  gradual strengthening after that. The 
scenario illustrates the outcomes of many scenarios in the literature 
that project the trend from implemented policies until the end of 
2020. The ModAct pathway explores the impact of implementing 
the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) as formulated in 

literature, these two reference pathways lead to an increase in global 
mean temperature of more than 2°C (Section 3.3).
The Illustrative Mitigation Pathways (IMPs) properly explore different 
pathways consistent with meeting the long-term temperature goals 
of the Paris Agreement. They represent five different pathways that 
emerge from the overall assessment. The IMPs differ in terms of their 
focus, for example, placing greater emphasis on renewables (IMP-Ren), 
deployment of carbon dioxide removal that results in net negative 
global GHG emissions (IMP-Neg), and efficient resource use and 
shifts in consumption patterns, leading to low demand for resources, 
while ensuring a high level of services (IMP-LD). Other IMPs illustrate 
the implications of a  less rapid introduction of mitigation measures 
followed by a subsequent gradual strengthening (IMP-GS), and how 
shifting global pathways towards sustainable development, including 
by reducing inequality, can lead to mitigation (IMP-SP) In the IMP 
framework, IMP-GS is consistent with limiting warming to 2°C (>67%) 
(C3), IMP-Neg shows a strategy that also limits warming to 2°C (>67%) 
but returns to nearly 1.5°C (>50%) by the end of the century (hence 
indicated as C2*). The other variants that can limit warming to 1.5°C 
(>50%) (C1) were selected. In addition to these IMPs, sensitivity cases 
that explore alternative warming levels (C3) for IMP-Neg and IMP-Ren  
are assessed (IMP-Neg-2.0 and IMP-Ren-2.0).
The IMPs are selected to have different mitigation strategies, which 
can be illustrated looking at the energy system and emission pathways 
(Figure 3.7 and Figure 3.8). The mitigation strategies show the different 
options in emission reduction (Figure 3.7). Each panel shows the key 
characteristics leading to total GHG emissions, consisting of residual 
(gross) emissions (fossil CO2 emissions, CO 2 emissions from industrial 
processes, and non-CO 2 emissions) and removals (net land-use change, 
bioenergy with carbon capture and storage  – BECCS, and direct air 
carbon capture and storage – DACCS), in addition to avoided emissions 
through the use of carbon capture and storage on fossil fuels. The 
IMP-Neg and IMP-GS scenarios were shown to illustrate scenarios 
with a significant role of CDR. The energy supply (Figure 3.8) shows 
the phase-out of fossil fuels in the IMP-LD, IMP-Ren and IMP-SP cases, 
but a less substantial decrease in the IMP-Neg case. The IMP-GS case

Figure 3.5 | (a) Process for creating the AR6 scenario database and selecting the illustrative (mitigation) pathways.  The compiled scenarios in the AR6 
scenarios database were vetted for consistency with historical statistics and subsequently a temperature classification was added using climate model emulators. The illustrative 
(mitigation) pathways were selected from the full set of pathways based on storylines of critical mitigation strategies that emerged from the assessment. (b) An overview of 
the Illustrative Pathways selected for use in IPCC AR6 WGIII, consisting of pathways illustrative of higher emissions, Current Policies (CurPol) and Moderate Action (ModAct), 
and Illustrative Mitigation Pathways (IMPs): gradual strengthening of current policies (IMP-GS), extensive use of net negative emissions (IMP-Neg), renewables (IMP-Ren), 
low demand (IMP-LD), and shifting pathways (IMP-SP). The Ren2.0 and Neg2.0 scenarios are alternative scenarios to the IMPs. These pathways are based on renewables and 
extensive use of negative emissions, respectively, but leading to temperature levels comparable to the C3 category and have sometimes been used for comparison.

needs to make up its slow start by (i)  rapid reductions mid-century 
and (ii) massive reliance on net negative emissions by the end of the 
century. The CurPol and ModAct cases both result in relatively high 
emissions, showing a  slight increase and stabilisation compared to 
current emissions, respectively.
3.3 Emission Pathways, Including Socio-
economic, Carbon Budget and Climate 
Responses Uncertainties
3.3.1 Socio-economic Drivers of Emissions Scenarios
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions mainly originate from the use and 
transformation of energy, agriculture, land use (change) and industrial 
activities. The future development of these sources is  influenced 
by trends in socio-economic development, including  population, 
economic activity, technology, politics, lifestyles, and climate policy. 
Trends for these factors are not independent, and scenarios provide 
a consistent outlook for these factors together (Section 3.2). Marangoni 
et al. (2017) show that in projections, assumptions influencing 
energy intensity (e.g., structural change, lifestyle and efficiency) and 
economic growth are the most important determinants of future 
CO2 emissions from energy combustion. Other critical factors include 
technology assumptions, preferences, resource assumptions and 
policy (van Vuuren et al. 2008). As many of the factors are represented 
differently in specific models, the model itself is also an important 
factor  – providing a  reason for the importance of model diversity 
(Sognnaes et al. 2021). For land use, Stehfest et al. (2019) show that 
assumptions on population growth are more dominant given that 
variations in per capita consumption of food are smaller than for 
energy. Here, we only provide a brief overview of some key drivers. We 
focus first on so-called reference scenarios (without stringent climate 
policy) and look at mitigation scenarios in detail later. We use the SSPs 
to discuss trends in more detail. The SSPs were published in 2017, and 
by now, some elements will have to be updated (O’Neill et al. 2020b). 
Still, the ranges represent the full literature relatively well.
Historically, population and GDP have been growing over time. 
Scenario studies agree that further global population growth 
is likely up to 2050, leading to a  range of possible outcomes of 
around 8.5–11 billion people (Figure 3.9a). After 2050, projections 
show a much wider range. If fertility drops below replacement levels, 
a decline in the global population is possible (as illustrated by SSP1 
and SSP5). This typically includes scenarios with rapid development 
and investment in education. However, median projections mostly 
show a  stabilisation of the world population (e.g.,  SSP2), while 
high-end projections show a continued growth (e.g., SSP3). The UN 
Population Prospects include considerably higher values for both 
the medium projection and the high end of the range than the SSP 
scenarios (KC and Lutz 2017; UN 2019). The most recent median 
UN projection reaches almost 11 billion people in 2100. The key 
differences are in Africa and China: here, the population projections 
are strongly influenced by the rate of fertility change (faster drop in 
SSPs). Underlying these differences, the UN approach is more based 
on current demographic trends while the SSPs assume a  broader 
range of factors (including education) driving future fertility.Economic growth is even more uncertain than the population projections 
(Figure  3.9c). The average growth rate of GDP was about  2.8% per 
year (constant USD) in the 1990–2019 period (The World Bank 2021). 
In 2020, the COVID-19 crisis resulted in a  considerable drop in GDP 
(estimated around  4–5%) (IMF 2021). After a  recovery period, most 
economic projections assume growth rates to converge back to previous 
projections, although at a lower level (IMF 2021; OECD 2021) (see also 
Box  3.2). In the long term, assumptions on future growth relate to 
political stability, the role of the progress of the technology frontier and 
the degree to which countries can catch up (Johansson et al. 2013). The 
SSP scenarios cover an extensive range, with low per-capita growth in 
SSP3 and SSP4 (mostly in developing countries) and rapid growth in 
SSP1 and SSP5. At the same, however, also scenarios outside the range 
have some plausibility – including the option of economic decline (Kallis 
et al. 2012) or much faster economic development (Christensen et al. 
2018). The OECD long-term projection is at the global level reasonably 
consistent with SSP2. Equally important economic parameters include 
income distribution (inequity) and the type of growth (structural 
change,  i.e.,  services vs manufacturing industries). Some projections 
(like SSP1) show a considerable convergence of income levels within 
and across countries, while in other projections, this does not occur 
(e.g., SSP3). Most scenarios reflect the suggested inverse relationship 
between the assumed growth rate for income and population growth 
(Figure  3.9e). SSP1 and SSP5 represent examples of scenarios with 
relatively low population increase and relatively high-income increase 
over the century. SSP3 represents an example of the opposite – while 
SSP2 and SSP4 are placed more in the middle. Nearly all scenarios 
assessed here do not account for climate impacts on growth (mostly 
for methodological reasons). As discussed in Section 3.5 these impacts 
can be considerable. An emerging area of literature emphasises the 
possibility of stabilisation (or even decline) of income levels in developed 
countries, arguing that such a trend would be preferred or even needed 
for environmental reasons (Anderson and Larkin 2013; Hickel and Kallis 
2020; Kallis et al. 2020; Hickel et al. 2021; Keyßer and Lenzen 2021) (see 
also Chapter 5). Such scenarios are not common among IAM outcomes, 
that are more commonly based on the idea that decarbonisation can 
be combined with economic growth by a combination of technology, 
lifestyle and structural economic changes. Still, such scenarios could 
result in a dramatic reduction of energy and resource consumption.
Scenarios show a range of possible energy projections. In the absence 
of climate policy, most scenarios project the final energy demand 
to continue to grow to around 650–800 EJ yr–1 in 2100 (based on 
the AR6 Scenarios Database, Figure  3.9b). Some projections show 
a very high energy demand up to 1000 EJ yr–1 (comparable to SSP5). 
The scenario of the IEA lies within the SSP range but near the SSP1 
projection. However, it should be noted that the IEA scenario includes 
current policies (most reference scenarios do not) and many scenarios 
published before 2021 did not account for the COVID-19 crisis. Several 
researchers discuss the possibility of decoupling material and energy 
demand from economic growth in the literature, mainly in developed 
countries (Kemp-Benedict 2018) (decoupling here refers to either 
a much slower increase in demand or even a decrease). In the scenario 
literature, this is reflected by scenarios with very low demand for final 
energy based on increased energy efficiency and less energy-intensive 
lifestyles (e.g., SSP1 and the LED scenario) (Grubler et al. 2018; van 
Vuuren et al. 2018). While these studies show the feasibility of such

pathways, their energy efficiency improvement rates are considerably 
above the historic range of around 2% (Gütschow et al. 2018; Jeffery et 
al. 2018; Vrontisi et al. 2018; Haberl et al. 2020; Roelfsema et al. 2020; 
Giarola et al. 2021; Höhne et al. 2021; IEA 2021a; Höhne et al. 2021; 
Sognnaes et al. 2021). These scenarios also show clear differences in 
food consumption and the amount of land used for agriculture. Food 
demand in terms of per-capita caloric intake is projected to increase in 
most scenarios (Figure 3.9d). However, it should be noted that there 
are large differences in dietary composition across the scenarios (from 
more meat-intensive in scenarios such as SSP5 to a decrease in meat 
consumptions in other scenarios such as SSP1). Land-use projections 
also depend on assumed changes in yield and the population scenarios 
(Figure 3.9f). Typically, changes in land use are less drastic than some 
other parameters (in fact, the  5–95th percentile database range 
is almost stable). Agriculture land is projected to increase in SSP3, SSP2, and SSP4 – it is more-or-less stable in SSP5 and is projected to 
decline in SSP1.

The higher categories (C6 and C7) mostly included scenarios with 
no or modest climate policy. Because of the progression of climate 
policy, it is becoming more common that reference scenarios 
incorporate implemented climate policies. Modelling studies typically 
implement current or pledged policies up until 2030 (Vrontisi et al. 
2018; Roelfsema et al. 2020; Sognnaes et al. 2021) with some studies 
focusing also on the policy development in the long term (Höhne 
et al. 2021; IEA  2021a; Jeffery et al. 2018; Gütschow et al. 2018).  
Based on the assessment in Chapter 4, reference pathways consistent 
with the implementation and trend from implemented policies until 
the  end of 2020 are associated with increased GHG emissions 
from 59 (53–65) GtCO 2-eq yr–1 in 2019 to 54–60 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 by 

with these near-term emissions characteristics lead to a  median 
global warming of 2.2°C to 3.5°C by 2100 (see also further in this 
section). These pathways consider policies at the time that they 
were developed. A recent model comparison that harmonised socio-
economic, technological, and policy assumptions (Giarola et al. 2021) 
found a  2.2°C–2.9°C median temperature rise in 2100 for current 
and stated policies, with the results sensitive to the model used and 
the method of implementing policies (Sognnaes et al. 2021). Scenario 
inference and construction methods using similar policy assumptions 
lead to a median range of 2.9°C–3.2°C in 2100 for current policies 
and 2.4°C–2.9°C in 2100 for 2030 pledges (Höhne et al. 2021). The 
median spread of 1°C across these studies (2.2°C–3.2°C) indicates 
the deep uncertainties involved with modelling temperature 
outcomes of 2030 policies through to 2100 (Höhne et al. 2021).
The lower categories include increasingly stringent assumed climate 
policies. For all scenario categories, except the highest category, emissions peak in the 21st century. For the lowest categories, 
the emissions peak is mostly before 2030. In fact, for scenarios 
in the  category that avoids temperature overshoot for the  1.5°C 
scenario (C1 category), GHG emissions are reduced already to almost 
zero around the middle of the century. Typically, CO 2 emissions reach 
net zero about 10 to 40 years before total GHG emissions reach net 
zero. The main reason is that scenarios reduce non-CO 2 greenhouse 
gas emissions less than CO 2 due to a  limited mitigation potential 
(Section 3.3.2.2). Figure 3.10 also shows that many scenarios in the 
literature with a temperature outcome below 2°C show net negative 
emissions. There are, however, also exceptions in which more 
immediate emission reductions limits the need for CDR. The IMPs 
illustrate alternative pathways to reach the C1–C3 temperature levels.
Figure 3.11 shows the possible consequences of the different scenario 
categories for global mean temperature calculated using a reduced 
complexity model (RCM) calibrated to the IPCC AR6 WGI assessment 
(see Annex III.II.2.5 of this report and Cross-Chapter Box 7.1 in 
AR6 WGI report). For the C5–C7 categories (containing most of the 
reference and current policy scenarios), the global mean temperature 
is expected to increase throughout the century (and further increase 
will happen after 2100 for C6 and C7). While warming would more 
likely than not  be in the range from 2.2°C to 3.5°C, warming up to 5°C 
cannot be excluded. The highest emissions scenarios in the literature 
combine assumptions about rapid long-term economic growth 
and pervasive climate policy failures, leading to a reversal of some 
recent trends (Box 3.3). For the categories C1–C4, a peak in global 
mean temperature is reached mid-century for most scenarios in the 
database, followed by a small (C3/C4) or more considerable decline 
(C1/C2). There is a clear distinction between the scenarios with no or Box 3.2 | Impact of COVID-19 on Long-term Emissions
The reduction in CO 2 emissions of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 was estimated to be about 6% (Section 4.2.2.4 and Table 4.SM.2) 
lower than 2019 levels (Forster et al. 2020; Friedlingstein et al. 2020; Liu et al. 2020c; BP 2021; Crippa et al. 2021; IEA 2021; Le Quéré 
et al. 2021). Near-real-time monitoring estimates show a rebound in emissions levels, meaning 2021 emissions levels are expected 
to be higher than 2020 (Le Quéré et al. 2021). The longer-term effects are uncertain but so far do not indicate a clear structural 
change for climate policy related to the pandemic. The increase in renewable shares in 2020 could stimulate a further transition, 
but slow economic growth can also slow down (renewable) energy investments. Also, lifestyle changes during the crisis can still 
develop in different directions (working from home, but maybe also living further away from work). Without a major intervention, 
most long-term scenarios project that emissions will start to follow a similar pathway as earlier projections (although at a reduced 
level) (IEA 2020b; Kikstra et al. 2021a; Rochedo et al. 2021). If emissions reductions are limited to only a short time, the adjustment 
of pathways will lead to negligible outcomes in the order of 0.01K (Forster et al. 2020; Jones et al. 2021). At the same time, however, 
the large amount of investments pledged in the recovery packages could provide a  unique opportunity to determine the long-
term development of infrastructure, energy systems and land use (Andrijevic et al. 2020b; Hepburn et al. 2020; Pianta et al. 2021). 
Near-term alternative recovery pathways have been shown to have the potential to influence carbon-price pathways, and energy 
investments and electrification requirements under stringent mitigation targets (Bertram et al. 2021; Kikstra et al. 2021a; Pollitt et al. 
2021; Rochedo et al. 2021; Shan et al. 202). Most studies suggest a noticeable reduction in 2030 emissions. However, much further 
reductions would be needed to reach the emission levels consistent with mitigation scenarios that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) 
or lower (see Chapter 4). At the moment, the share of investments in greenhouse gas reduction is relatively small in most recovery 
packages, and no structural shifts for climate policies are observed linked to the pandemic. Finally, most of the scenarios analysed 
in this Chapter do not include the 2020 emissions reduction related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The effect of the pandemic on the 
pathways will likely be very small. The assessment of climate mitigation pathways in this chapter should be interpreted as being 
almost exclusively based on the assumption of a fast recovery with limited persistent effects on emissions or structural changes.
Box 3.3 | The Likelihood of High-end Emissions Scenarios
At the time the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) were published, they included three scenarios that could represent 
emission developments in the absence of climate policy: RCP4.5, RCP6 and RCP8.5, described as, respectively, low, medium and high-
end scenarios in the absence of strong climate policy (van Vuuren et al. 2011). RCP8.5 was described as representative of the top 5% 
scenarios in the literature. The SSPs-based set of scenarios covered the RCP forcing levels, adding a new low scenario (at 1.9 W m–2). 
Hausfather and Peters (2020) pointed out that since 2011, the rapid development of renewable energy technologies and emerging 
climate policy have made it considerably less likely that emissions could end up as high as RCP8.5. Still, emission trends in developing 
countries track RCP8.5 Pedersen et al. (2020), and high land-use emissions could imply that emissions would continue to do so in the 
future, even at the global scale (Schwalm et al. 2020). Other factors resulting in high emissions include higher population or economic 
growth as included in the SSPs (Section 3.3.1) or rapid development of new energy services. Climate projections of RCP8.5 can also 
result from strong feedbacks of climate change on (natural) emission sources and high climate sensitivity (AR6 WGI Chapter 7), and 
therefore their median climate impacts might also materialise while following a lower emission path (e.g., Hausfather and Betts 2020). 
The discussion also relates to a more fundamental discussion on assigning likelihoods to scenarios, which is extremely difficult given 
the deep uncertainty and direct relationship with human choice. However, it would help to appreciate certain projections (e.g., Ho 
et al. 2019). All in all, this means that high-end scenarios have become considerably less likely since AR5 but cannot be ruled out. It 
is important to realise that RCP8.5 and SSP5-8.5 do not represent a typical ‘business-as-usual’ projection but are only useful as high-
end, high-risk scenarios. Reference emission scenarios (without additional climate policy) typically end up in the C5–C7 categories 
included in this assessment.

limited overshoot (typically <0.1°C, C1) compared to those with high 
overshoot (C2): in emissions, the C1 category is characterised by steep 
early reductions and a relatively small contribution of net negative 
emissions (like IMP-LD and IMP-Ren) (Figure  3.10). In addition to 
the temperature caused by the range of scenarios in each category 
(main panel), climate uncertainties also contribute to a  range of 
temperature outcomes (including uncertainties regarding the carbon 
cycle, climate sensitivity, and the rate of change, see AR6 WGI). The 
bars on the right of Figure 3.11 show the uncertainty range for each category (combining scenario and climate uncertainty). While the C1 
category more likely than not limits warming to 1.5°C (>50%) by the 
end of the century, even with such a scenario, warming above 2°C 
cannot be excluded (95th percentile). The uncertainty range for the 
highest emission categories (C7) implies that these scenarios could 
lead to a warming above 6°C.

emissions in the 2020–2100 period. Panels (c) and (d) show the development of CH 4 and N 2O emissions over time. Energy emissions include the contribution of BECCS. For both

percentile, the average value and the highest 5–15th percentile. These illustrate the range of scenarios in each category. The definition of C1–C7 can be found in Table 3.1.
The trajectory of future CO 2 emissions plays a critical role in mitigation, 
given CO 2 long-term impact and dominance in total greenhouse gas 
forcing. As shown in Figure 3.12, CO 2 dominates total greenhouse 
gas emissions in the high-emissions scenarios but is also reduced 
most, going from scenarios in the highest to lower categories. In C4 
and below, most scenarios exhibit net negative CO 2 emissions in the 
second half of the century compensating for some of the residual 
emissions of non-CO 2 gases as well as reducing overall warming 
from an intermediate peak. Still, early emission reductions and further 
reductions in non-CO 2 emissions can also lead to scenarios without 
net negative emissions in 2100, even in C1 and C3 (shown for the 
85–95th percentile). In C1, avoidance of significant overshoot implies 
that immediate gross reductions are more relevant than long-term 
net negative emissions (explaining the lower number than in C2) but 
carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is still playing a role in compensating 
for remaining positive emissions in hard-to-abate sectors.
CH4 and N 2O emissions are also reduced from C7 to C1, but this mostly 
occurs between C7 and C5. The main reason is the characteristics 
of abatement potential: technical measures can significantly reduce 
CH4 and N 2O emissions at relatively low costs to about 50% of the 
current levels (e.g., by reducing CH 4 leaks from fossil fuel production 
and transport, reducing landfill emissions gazing, land management 
and introducing measures related to manure management, see also 
Chapter 7 and 11). However, technical potential estimates become 
exhausted even if the stringency of mitigation is increased (Harmsen 
et al. 2019a,b; Höglund-Isaksson et al. 2020). Therefore, further 
reduction may come from changes in activity levels, such as switching 
to a less meat-intensive diet, therefore reducing livestock (Stehfest 
et al. 2009; Willett et al. 2019; Ivanova et al. 2020) (Chapter 7). Other 
non-CO 2 GHG emissions (halogenated gases) are reduced to low 
levels for scenarios below 2.5°C.
Short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs) also play an important role in climate 
change, certainly for short-term changes (AR6 WGI, Figure  SPM.2) 
(Shindell et al. 2012). These forcers consist of (i) substances contributing 
to warming, such as methane, black carbon and tropospheric ozone, 
and (ii) substances contributing to cooling (other aerosols, such as 
related to sulphur emissions). Most SLCFs are also air pollutants, and 
reducing their emissions provides additional co-benefits (Shindell et al. 
2017a,b; Hanaoka and Masui 2020). In the case of the first group, 
emission reduction thus leads to both air pollution and climate benefits. 
For the second, group there is a possible trade-off (Shindell and Smith 
2019; Lund et al. 2020). As aerosol emissions are mostly associated 
with fossil fuel combustion, the benefits of reducing CO 2 could, in 
the short term, be reduced as a result of lower aerosol cooling. There 
has been an active discussion on the exact climate contribution of 
SLCF-focused policies in the literature. This discussion partly emerged 
from different assumptions on possible reductions in the absence of 
ambitious climate policy and the uncertain global climate benefit from 
aerosol (black carbon) (Rogelj et al. 2014). The latter is now assessed to 
be smaller than originally thought (Takemura and Suzuki 2019; Smith 
et al. 2020b) (see also AR6 WGI Section 6.4). Reducing SLCF emissions 
is critical to meet long-term climate goals and might help reduce 
the rate of climate change in the short term. Deep SLCF emission 
reductions also increase the remaining carbon budget for a  specific 
temperature goal (Rogelj et al. 2015a; Reisinger et al. 2021) (Box 3.4). 
A more detailed discussion can be found in AR6 WGI Chapters 5 and 6.For accounting of emissions and the substitution of different gases as 
part of a  mitigation strategy, typically, emission metrics are used to 
compare the climate impact of different gases. Most policies currently 
use Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) with a  100-year time horizon 
as this is also mandated for emissions reporting in the Paris Rulebook 
(for a  wider discussion of GHG metrics, see Box 2.1 in Chapter  2 of 
this report, and AR6 WGI, Chapter 7, Section 7.6). Alternative metrics 
have also been proposed, such as those using a shorter or longer time 
horizon, or those that focus directly on the consequences of reaching 
a certain temperature target (Global Temperature Change Potential – 
GTP), allowing a more direct comparison with cumulative CO 2 emissions 
(Allen et al. 2016; Lynch et al. 2020) or focusing on damages (Global 
Damage Potential) (an overview is given in Chapter 2, and Cross-Chapter 
Box 3 in Chapter 3). Depending on the metric, the value attributed to 
reducing short-lived forcers such as methane can be lower in the near 
term (e.g., in the case of GTP) or higher (GWP with a short reference 
period). For most metrics, however, the impact on mitigation strategies is 
relatively small, among others, due to the marginal abatement cost curve 
of methane (low costs for low-to-medium mitigation levels; expensive 
for high levels). The timing of reductions across different gases impacts 
warming and the co-benefits (Harmsen et al. 2016; Cain et al. 2019). 
Nearly all scenarios in the literature use GWP-100 in cost-optimisation, 
reflecting the existing policy approach; the use of GWP-100 deviates 
from cost-optimal mitigation pathways by at most a  few percent for 
temperature goals that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower (Box 2.1).
Cumulative CO 2 emissions and temperature goals
The dominating role of CO 2 and its long lifetime in the atmosphere 
and some critical characteristics of the Earth System implies that 
there is a  strong relationship between cumulative CO 2 emissions 
and temperature outcomes (Allen et al. 2009; Matthews et al. 2009; 
Meinshausen et al. 2009; MacDougall and Friedlingstein 2015). This 
is illustrated in Figure 3.13, which plots the cumulative CO 2 emissions 
against the projected outcome for global mean temperature, both until 
peak temperature and through to end of century (or 2100). The deviations 
from a linear relationship in Figure 3.13 are mostly caused by different 
non-CO 2 emission and forcing levels (see also Rogelj et al. 2015b). This 
means that  reducing non-CO 2 emissions can play an important role 
in limiting peak warming: the smaller the residual non-CO 2 warming, 
the larger the carbon budget. This impact on carbon budgets can be 
substantial for stringent warming limits. For 1.5°C pathways, variations 
in non-CO 2 warming across different emission scenarios have been 
found to vary the remaining carbon budget by approximately 220 GtCO 2 
(AR6 WGI Chapter 5, Section 5.5.2.2). In addition to reaching net zero 
CO2 emissions, a strong reduction in methane emissions is the most 
critical component in non-CO 2 mitigation to keep the Paris climate goals 
in reach (Collins et al. 2018; van Vuuren et al. 2018) (see also AR6 WGI, 
Chapters 5, 6 and 7). It should be noted that the temperature categories 
(C1–C7) generally aligned with the horizontal axis, except for the end-
of-century values for C1 and C2 that coincide.
Box 3.4 | Consistency of Remaining Carbon Budgets in the WGI Assessment and Cumulative 
CO2 Emissions in WGIII Mitigation Pathways
Introduction
The WGI assessment has shown that the increase in global mean temperature has a  near-linear relationship with cumulative 
CO2 emissions (Chapter 5, Section 5.5, Box 5.3 of AR6 WGI report). Consistently, WGI has confirmed that net zero CO 2 emissions are 
required to halt CO 2-induced warming. This permits the estimation of carbon budgets consistent with specific temperature goals. In 
Chapter 3, we present the temperature outcomes and cumulative CO 2 emissions associated with different warming levels for around 

II.3.2). In this box, we discuss the consistency of the assessments presented here and in IPCC AR6 WGI. The box summarises how 
the remaining carbon budgets assessed by AR6 WGI relate to the remaining cumulative CO 2 emissions until the time of net zero CO 2 
emissions in mitigation pathways (Tables 3.2 and SPM.1) assessed by AR6 WGIII.
In its assessment, AR6 WGI uses a framework in which the various components of the remaining carbon budget are informed by 
various lines of evidence and assessed climate system characteristics. The AR6 WGIII, instead, uses around 1200 emission scenarios 
with estimated warming levels that cover the scenario range presented in AR6 WGI but also contain many more intermediate 
projections with varying emission profiles and a combination of CO 2 emissions and other greenhouse gases. In order to assess their 
climate outcomes, climate model emulators are used. The emulators are reduced complexity climate models that are provided by AR6 
WGI, and which are calibrated to the AR6 WGI assessment of future warming for various purposes (a detailed description of the use of 
climate model emulators in the AR6 WGI and WGIII assessments can be found in Cross-Chapter Box 7.1 in the AR6 WGI report, with 
the connection of WGI and WGIII discussed in Annex III.2.5.1).
Remaining carbon budgets estimated by AR6 WGI
The AR6 WGI estimated the remaining carbon budgets from their assessment of (i) the transient climate response to cumulative 
emissions of carbon dioxide (TCRE), and estimates of (ii) the historical human-induced warming, (iii) the temperature change after 
reaching net zero CO 2 emissions, (iv) the contribution of future non-CO 2 warming (derived from the emissions scenarios assessed in 
the Special Report on 1.5°C Warming using WGI-calibrated emulators), and (v) the Earth System feedbacks (AR6 WGI Chapter 5.5, 
Box 5.2).  For a given warming level, AR6 WGI assessed the remaining carbon budget from the beginning of 2020 onwards. These are 
650/500/400 GtCO 2 for limiting warming to 1.5°C with 33%/50%/ 67% chance and 1350/1150 GtCO 2 for limiting warming to 2°C 
with 50%/67% chance. The estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty related to historical warming, future non-CO 2 forcing, 
and poorly quantified climate feedbacks. For instance, variation in non-CO 2 emissions across scenarios are estimated to either increase 
or decrease the remaining carbon budget estimates by 220 GtCO 2. The estimates of the remaining carbon budget assume that non-
CO2 emissions are reduced consistently with the tight temperature targets for which the budgets are estimated.
Cumulative CO 2 emissions until net zero estimated by AR6 WGIII
The AR6 WGIII provides estimates of cumulative net CO 2 emissions (from 2020 inclusive) until the time of reaching net zero CO 2 emissions 
(henceforth called ‘peak cumulative CO 2 emissions’) and until the end of the century for eight temperature classes that span a range of 
warming levels. The numbers can be found in Table 3.2 (330–710 GtCO 2 for C1; 530–930 for C2; and 640–1160 for C3).
Comparing the AR6 WGI remaining carbon budgets and remaining cumulative CO 2 emissions of the AR6 WGIII scenarios
A comparison between AR6 WGI and WGIII findings requires recognising that, unlike in WGI, cumulative emissions in WGIII are not 
provided for a specific peak-warming threshold or level but are instead provided for a set of scenarios in a category, representing 
a  specific range of peak-temperature outcomes (for instance the C4 category contains scenarios with a  median peak warming 
anywhere between approximately 1.8°C and up to 2°C). When accounting for this difference, the AR6 WGI and WGIII findings are 
very consistent for temperature levels below 2°C. Figure 1 compares the peak temperatures and associated cumulative CO 2 emissions 
(i.e., peak cumulative CO 2 emissions) for the WGIII scenarios to the remaining carbon budgets assessed by WGI. This shows only minor 
differences between the WGI and WGIII approaches.
After correcting for the categorisation, some (small) differences between the AR6 WGI and WGIII numbers arise from remaining 
differences between the outcomes of the climate emulators and their set-up (IPCC AR6 WGI Cross-Chapter Box 7.1) and the differences 
in the underlying scenarios. Moreover, the WGI assessment estimated the non-CO 2 warming at the time of net zero CO 2 emissions 
based on a relationship derived from the SR1.5 scenario database with historical emission estimates as in Meinshausen et al. (2020) 
(AR6 WGI Chapter 5). The WGIII assessment uses the same climate emulator with improved historical emissions estimates (Nicholls 
et al. 2021) (AR6 WGI Cross-Chapter Box  7.1). Annex III.II.2.5.1 further explores the effects of these factors on the relationship 
between non-CO 2 warming at peak cumulative CO 2 and peak surface temperature.
Estimates of the remaining carbon budgets thus vary with the assumed level of non-CO 2 emissions, which are a function of policies 
and technology development. The linear relationship used in the AR6 WGI assessment between peak temperature and the warming 
as a result of non-CO 2 emissions (based on the SR1.5 data) is shown in the right panel of Figure 2 (dashed line). In the AR6 WGIII 
approach, the non-CO 2 warming for each single scenario is based on the individual scenario characteristics. This is shown in the same 
figure by plotting the outcomes of scenario outcomes of a range of models (dots). The lines show the fitted data for individual models, 
emphasising the clear differences across models and the relationship with peak warming (policy level). In some scenarios, stringent 
non-CO 2 emission reductions provide an option to reach more stringent climate goals with the same carbon budget. This is especially 
the case for scenarios with a very low non-CO 2 warming, for instance, as a result of methane reductions through diet change. The 
left panel shows how these differences impact estimates of the remaining carbon budget. While the AR6 scenarios database includes 
a broad range of non-CO 2 emission projections the overall range is still very consistent with the WGI relationship and the estimated 
uncertainty with a ±220 GtCO 2 range (see also Figure 5 in Annex III.II.2.5.1).
Overall, the slight differences between the cumulative emissions in AR6 WGIII and the carbon budget in AR6 WGI are because the 
non-CO 2 warming in the WGIII scenarios is slightly lower than in the SR1.5 scenarios that are used for the budget estimates in WGI 
(Annex III.2.5.1). In addition, improved consistency with Cross-Chapter Box 7.1 in Chapter 7, AR6 WGI results in a non-CO 2-induced 
temperature difference of about about 0.05K between the assessments. Recalculating the remaining carbon budget using the WGI 
methodology combined with the full AR6 WGIII scenario database results in a reduction of the estimated remaining 1.5°C carbon 
budget by about 100 GtCO 2 (–20%), and a reduction of about 40 GtCO 2 (–3%) for 2°C. Accounting also for the categorisation effect, 
the difference between the WGI and WGIII estimates is found to be small and well within the uncertainty range (Figure 1). This means 
that the cumulative CO 2 emissions presented in WGIII and the WGI carbon budgets are highly consistent.
A detailed comparison of the impact of different assessment steps (i.e., the new emulators, scenarios, and harmonisation methods), 
has been made and is presented in Figure 6 in Annex III.II.3.2 .Box 3.4 (continued)

Box 3.4, Figure 1 | Cumulative CO 2 emissions from AR6 scenario categories (coloured dots), adjusted for distinct 0.1°C warming levels (black 
bars) in comparison to the WGI remaining carbon budgets (grey bars).  The cumulative carbon emissions for the AR6 scenarios are shown for the median 
peak warming (a), the 33rd-percentile peak warming (b) and the upper 67th-percentile peak warming (c) calculated with the WGI-calibrated emulator MAGICC7 
(IPCC AR6 WGI, Cross-Chapter Box 7.1). The adjustment to the nearest 0.1°C intervals is made using AR6 WGI TCRE (at the relevant percentile, e.g., the 67th-percentile 
TCRE is used to adjust the 67th-percentile peak warming), with the 5–95% range of adjusted scenarios provided by the black bar. The AR6 WGI remaining carbon 
budget is shown, including the WGI estimate of at least a ±220 GtCO 2 uncertainty due to non-CO 2 emissions variations across scenarios (grey bars). For median 
peak warming (panel  a) projections below 2°C relative to 1850–1900, the AR6 WGIII assessment of cumulative carbon emissions tends to be slightly smaller 
than the remaining carbon budgets provided by WGI but well within the uncertainties. Note that only a few scenarios in WGIII limit warming to below 1.5°C with 
a 50% chance, thus statistics for that specific threshold have low confidence.
Policy implications
The concept of a finite carbon budget means that the world needs to get to net zero CO 2, no matter whether global warming is 
limited to 1.5°C or well below 2°C (or any other level). Moreover, exceeding the remaining carbon budget will have consequences by 
overshooting temperature levels. Still, the relationship between the timing of net zero and temperature targets is a flexible one, as 
discussed further in Cross-Chapter Box 3 in this chapter. It should be noted that the national-level inventory as used by UNFCCC for 
the land use, land-use change and forestry sector is different from the overall concept of anthropogenic emissions employed by IPCC 
AR6 WGI. For emissions estimates based on these inventories, the remaining carbon budgets must be correspondingly reduced by 
approximately 15%, depending on the scenarios (Grassi et al., 2021) (Chapter 7). 
One of the uncertainties of the remaining carbon budget is the level of non-CO 2 emissions which is a function of policies and technology 
development. This represents a point of leverage for policies rather than an inherent geophysical uncertainty. Stringent non-CO 2 emission 
reductions hence can provide – to some degree – an option to reach more stringent climate goals with the same carbon budget.Box 3.4 (continued)

assessed in AR6 WGI Chapter 5.
The near-linear relationship implies that cumulative CO 2 emissions 
are critically important for climate outcomes (Collins et al. 2013). 
The maximum temperature increase is a  direct function of the 
cumulative emissions until net zero CO 2 emissions is reached 
(the emission budget) (Figure  3.13, left side). The end-of-century 
temperature correlates well with cumulative emissions across 
the century (right panel). For long-term climate goals, positive 
emissions in the first half of the century can be offset by net 
removal of CO 2 from the atmosphere (net negative emissions) at 
the cost of a  temporary overshoot of the target (Tokarska et al. 
2019). The bottom panels of Figure 3.13 show the contribution of 
net negative CO 2 emissions.
Focusing on cumulative emissions, the right-hand panel of 
Figure  3.12b shows that for high-end scenarios (C6–C7), most 
emissions originate from fossil fuels, with a  smaller contribution 
from net deforestation. For C5 and lower, there is also a  negative 
contribution to emissions from both AFOLU emissions and energy systems. For the energy systems, these negative emissions originate 
from bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), while 
for AFOLU, they originate from reforestation and afforestation. For 
C3–C5, reforestation has a  larger CDR contribution than BECCS, 
mostly due to considerably lower costs (Rochedo et al. 2018). For C1 
and C2, the tight carbon budgets imply in many scenarios more CDR 
use (Riahi et al. 2021). Please note that net negative emissions are not 
so relevant for peak-temperature targets, and thus the C1 category, 
but CDR can still be used to offset the remaining positive emissions 
(Riahi et al. 2021). While positive CO 2 emissions from fossil fuels are 
significantly reduced, inertia and hard-to-abate sectors imply that 
in many C1–C3 scenarios, around 800–1000 GtCO 2 of net positive 
cumulative CO 2 emissions remain. This is consistent with literature 
estimates that current infrastructure is associated with 650 GtCO 2 
(best estimate) if operated until the end of its lifetime (Tong et al. 
2019). These numbers are considerably above the estimated carbon 
budgets for  1.5°C estimated in AR6 WGI, hence explaining CDR 
reliance (either to offset emissions immediately or later in time).

Figure 3.13 | The near-linear relationship between cumulative CO 2 emissions and temperature.  The left panel shows cumulative emissions until net zero emission 
is reached. The right panel shows cumulative emissions until the end of the century, plotted against peak and end-of-century temperature, respectively. Both are shown as 
a function of non-CO 2 forcing and cumulative net negative CO 2 emissions. Position temperature categories (circles) and IPs are also indicated, including two 2°C sensitivity 
cases for Neg (Neg-2.0) and Ren (Ren-2.0).
Creating net negative emissions can thus be an important part of 
a mitigation strategy to offset remaining emissions or compensate 
for emissions earlier in time. As indicated above, there are different 
ways to potentially achieve this, including reforestation and 
afforestation and BECCS (as often covered in IAMs) but also soil 
carbon enhancement, direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS) 
and ocean alkalinisation (Chapter 12). Except for reforestation, these 
options have not been tested at large scale and often require more  R&D. 
Moreover, the reliance on CDR in scenarios has been discussed given 
possible consequences of land use related to biodiversity loss and 
food security (BECCS and afforestation), the reliance on uncertain 
storage potentials (BECCS and DACCS), water use (BECCS), energy 
use (DACCS), the risks of possible temperature overshoot and the 
consequences for meeting Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
(Anderson and Peters 2016; Smith et al. 2016; Venton 2016; Peters 
and Geden 2017; van Vuuren et al. 2017; Honegger et al. 2021). In 
the case of BECCS, it should be noted that bioenergy typically is 
associated with early-on positive CO 2 emissions and net negative 
effects are only achieved in time (carbon debt), and its potential is 
limited (Cherubini et al. 2013; Hanssen et al. 2020); most IAMs have 
only a very limited representation of these time dynamics. Several 
scenarios have therefore explored how reliance on net negative CO 2 
emissions can be reduced or even avoided by alternative emission 
strategies (Grubler et al. 2018; van Vuuren et al. 2018) or early 
reductions by more stringent emission reduction in the short term 
(Rogelj et al. 2019b; Riahi et al. 2021). A more in-depth discussion 
of land-based mitigation options can be found in Chapter 7. It needs 
to be emphasised that even in strategies with net negative CO 2 
emissions, the emission reduction via more conventional mitigation 
measures (efficiency improvement, decarbonisation of energy supply) 
is much larger than the CDR contribution (Tsutsui et al. 2020).
3.3.2.3 The Timing of Net Zero Emissions
In addition to the constraints on change in global mean temperature, 
the Paris Agreement also calls for reaching a  balance of sources 
and sinks of GHG emissions (Art. 4). Different interpretations of the 
concept related to balance have been published (Rogelj et al. 2015c; 
Fuglestvedt et al. 2018). Key concepts include that of net zero CO 2 
emissions (anthropogenic CO 2 sources and sinks equal zero) and net 
zero greenhouse gas emissions (see Annex I: Glossary, and Box 3.3). 
The same notion can be used for all GHG emissions, but here 
ranges also depend on the use of equivalence metrics (Box  2.1). 
Moreover, it should be noted that while reaching net zero CO 2 
emissions typically coincides with the peak in temperature increase; 
net zero GHG emissions (based on GWP-100) imply a  decrease in 
global temperature (Riahi et al. 2021) and net zero GHG emissions 
typically require negative CO 2 emissions to compensate for the 
remaining emissions from other GHGs. Many countries have started 
to formulate climate policy in the year that net zero emissions (either 
CO2 or all greenhouse gases) are reached – although, at the moment, 
formulations are often still vague (Rogelj et al. 2021). There has 
been increased attention on the timing of net zero emissions in the 
scientific literature and ways to achieve it.Figure  3.14 shows that there is a  relationship between the 
temperature target, the cumulative CO 2 emissions budget, and the net 
zero year for CO 2 emissions (panel a) and the sum of greenhouse 
gases (panel b) for the scenarios published in the literature. In other 
words, the temperature targets from the Paris Agreement can, to 
some degree, be translated into a  net-zero emission year (Tanaka 
and  O’Neill 2018). There is, however, a  considerable spread. In 
addition to the factors influencing the emission budget (AR6 WGI 
and Section  3.3.2.2), this is influenced by the emission trajectory 
until net zero is reached, decisions related to temperature overshoot 
and non-CO 2 emissions (especially for the moment CO 2 reaches net 
zero emissions). Scenarios with limited or no net negative emissions 
and rapid near-term emission reductions can allow small positive 
emissions (e.g., in hard-to-abate-sectors). They may therefore have 
a later year that net zero CO 2 emissions are achieved. High emissions 
in the short term, in contrast, require an early net zero year.
For the scenarios in the C1 category (limit warming to 1.5°C (>50% 
with no or limited overshoot, the net zero year for CO 2 emissions 
is typically around 2035–2070. For scenarios in C3 (limiting 
warming to 2°C (>67%)), CO 2 emissions reach net zero around 
after 2050. Similarly, also the years for net zero GHG emissions 
can be calculated (see Fig 3.14b. The GHG net zero emissions year 
is typically around 10–40 years later than the carbon neutrality. 
Residual non-CO 2 emissions at the time of reaching net zero CO 2 
range between 5–11 GtCO 2-eq in pathways that limit warming to 
2°C (>67%) or lower. In pathways limiting warming to 2°C (>67%), 
methane is reduced by around 19% (3–46%) in 2030 and 46% (29–
64%) in 2050, and in pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C (>50%) 
with no or limited overshoot by around 34% (21–57%) in 2030 and 
a  similar 51% (35–70%) in 2050. Emissions-reduction potentials 
assumed in the pathways become largely exhausted when limiting 
warming to 2°C (>50%). N 2O emissions are reduced too, but similar 
to CH 4, emission reductions saturate for stringent climate goals. 
In the mitigation pathways, the emissions of cooling aerosols are 
reduced due to reduced use of fossil fuels. The overall impact on non-
CO2-related warming combines these factors.
In cost-optimal scenarios, regions will mostly achieve net zero 
emissions as a function of options for emission reduction, CDR, and 
expected baseline emission growth (van Soest et al. 2021b). This 
typically implies relatively early net zero emission years in scenarios 
for the Latin America region and relatively late net zero years for 
Asia and Africa (and average values for OECD countries). However, an 
allocation based on equity principles (such as responsibility, capability 
and equality) might result in different net zero years, based on the 
principles applied – with often earlier net zero years for the OECD 
(Fyson et al. 2020; van Soest et al. 2021b). Therefore, the emission 
trajectory until net zero emissions is a critical determinant of future 
warming (Section 3.5). The more CO 2 is emitted until 2030, the less 
CO2 can be emitted after that to stay below a warming limit (Riahi 
et al. 2015). As discussed before, also non-CO 2 forcing plays a key 
role in the short term.

This Cross-Chapter Box surveys scientific, technical and policy aspects of net zero carbon dioxide (CO 2) and net zero greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions, with a focus on timing, the relationship with warming levels, and sectoral and regional characteristics of net zero 
emissions. Assessment of net zero GHG emissions additionally requires consideration of non-CO 2 gases and choice of GHG emission 
metrics used to aggregate emissions and removals of different GHGs (Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 2 and Cross-Chapter Box 7 in 
Chapter 10). The following considers net zero CO 2 and GHG emissions globally, followed by regional and sectoral dimensions.
Net zero CO 2 emissions
Reaching net zero CO 2 emissions globally is necessary for limiting global warming to any level. At the point of net zero 
CO2, the amount of CO 2 human activity is putting into the atmosphere equals the amount of CO 2 human activity is removing from 
the atmosphere (see Annex I: Glossary). Reaching and sustaining net zero CO 2 emissions globally stabilizes CO 2-induced warming. 
Reaching net zero CO 2 emissions and then moving to net negative CO 2 emissions globally leads to a peak and decline in CO 2-induced 
warming (AR6 WGI Sections 5.5 and 5.6).
Limiting warming to 1.5°C (>50%) or to 2°C (>67%) requires deep, rapid, and sustained reductions of other greenhouse 
gases including methane alongside rapid reductions of CO 2 emissions to net zero. This ensures that the warming contributions 
from non-CO 2 forcing agents as well as from CO 2 emissions are both limited at low levels. The AR6 WGI estimated remaining carbon 
budgets until the time of reaching net zero CO 2 emissions for a range of warming limits, taking into account historical CO 2 emissions 
and projections of the warming from non-CO 2 forcing agents (Box 3.4 in Section 3.3, AR6 WGI Section 5.5).
The earlier global net zero CO 2 emissions are reached, the lower the cumulative net amount of CO 2 emissions and 
human-induced global warming, all else being equal (Figure 1a in this Cross-Chapter Box). For a given net zero date, a variation 
in the shape of the CO 2 emissions profile can lead to a variation in the cumulative net amount of CO 2 emissions until the time of net 
zero CO 2 and as a result to different peak-warming levels. For example, cumulative net CO 2 emissions until the time of reaching 
net zero CO 2 will be smaller, and peak warming lower, if emissions are reduced steeply and then more slowly compared to reducing 
emissions slowly and then more steeply (Figure 1b in this Cross-Chapter Box).0 1000 2000204020502060207020802090≥2100

to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot (light blue) and limiting warming to 2°C (>67%) (beige). Historic CO 2 emissions from Section 2.2 (EDGAR v6).
Net zero CO 2 emissions are reached between 2050–2055 (2035–2070) in global emissions pathways limiting warming 
to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot, and between 2070–2075 (2055–…) in pathways limiting warming to 2°C 
(>67%) as reported in the AR6 scenarios database (median five-year interval and 5–95th percentile ranges).5 The variation of 
non-CO 2 emissions in 1.5°C–2°C pathways varies the available remaining carbon budget which can move the time of reaching net 
zero CO 2 in these pathways forward or backward.6 The shape of the CO 2 emissions reduction profile also affects the time of reaching 
net zero CO 2 (Figure 1c in this Cross-Chapter Box). Global emission pathways that more than halve CO 2 emissions from 2020 to 2030 
can follow this rapid reduction by a more gradual decline towards net zero CO 2 and still limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited 
overshoot, reaching the point of net zero after 2050. The literature since SR1.5 included a larger fraction of such pathways than were 
available at the time of SR1.5. This is the primary reason for the small backward shift in the median estimate of reaching global net 
zero CO 2 emissions in 1.5°C pathways collected in the AR6 scenario database compared to SR1.5. This does not mean that the world 
is assessed to have more time to rapidly reduce current emissions levels compared to SR1.5. The assessment of emissions reductions 
by 2030 and 2040 in pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot has not changed substantially. It only 
means that the exact timing of reaching net zero CO 2 after a steep decline of CO 2 emissions until 2030 and 2040 can show some 
variation, and the SR1.5 median value of 2050 is still close to the middle of the current range (Figure 1c in this Cross-Chapter Box).
Pathways following emissions levels projected from the implementation of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) 
announced prior to COP26 until 2030 would result in substantially (>0.1°C) exceeding 1.5°C. They would have to reach 
net zero CO 2 around 5–10 years later7 than in pathways with no or limited overshoot in order to reach the net negative emissions 
that would then be required to return warming to 1.5°C (>50%) after a high overshoot by 2100. Those high overshoot pathways 
have higher transient warming and higher reliance on net negative CO 2 emissions towards the end of the 21st century. As they need 
to reach net zero CO 2 emissions in only limited amount of time but from much higher 2030 emissions levels, their post-2030 CO 2 
emissions reduction rates are substantially higher (by around 30%) than in pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited 
overshoot. (Section 3.5).
Pathways following emissions levels projected from the implementation of NDCs announced prior to COP26 until 

(>67%). While cost-effective pathways take around 50–55 years to reach net zero CO 2 emissions, those pathways would only have 
35–40 years left for transitioning to net zero CO 2 from 2030 onwards, close to the transition times that 1.5°C pathways are faced with 
today. Current CO 2 emissions and 2030 emission levels projected under the NDCs announced prior to COP26 are in a similar range 
(Sections 3.5 and 4.2).
Net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
The amount of CO 2-equivalent emissions and the point when net zero GHG emissions are reached in multi-GHG emissions 
pathways depends on the choice of GHG emissions metric. Various GHG emission metrics are available for this purpose.9 
GWP-100 is the most commonly used metric for reporting CO 2-equivalent emissions and is required for emissions reporting under the 
Rulebook of the Paris Agreement. (Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 2, Annex I and Annex II.9)

century. This is not inconsistent with the fundamental scientific requirement to reach net zero CO 2 emissions for a stable climate, but reflects that in some pathways, 
concurrent reductions in non-CO 2 emissions temporarily compensate for ongoing warming from CO 2 emissions. These would have to reach net zero CO 2 emissions 
eventually after 2100 to maintain these warming limits. For the two classes of pathways, the 95th percentile cannot be deduced from the scenario database as more 
than 5% of them do not reach net zero CO 2 by 2100.

pathways. This translates to a shift of the timing of net zero CO 2 by about ±10 years, assuming global CO 2 emissions decrease linearly from current levels of around 


zero during 2055–2060 (2045–2070) (median five-year interval and 5–95th percentile range).

net zero CO 2 emissions during 2065–2070 (2055–2090) compared with 2070–2075 (2055–…) in cost-effective pathways acting immediately to likely limit warming to

fluorinated gases (F-gases), and potentially other gases, to CO 2-equivalent emissions. The choice of metric ranges from global warming potentials (GWPs) and global 
temperature change potentials (GTP) to economically oriented metrics. All metrics have advantages and disadvantages depending on the context in which they are used 
(Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 2).Cross-Chapter Box 3 (continued)
For most choices of GHG emissions metric, reaching net zero GHG emissions requires net negative CO 2 emissions in order 
to balance residual CH 4, N2O and F-gas emissions. Under foreseen technology developments, some CH 4, N2O and F-gas emissions 
from, for example, agriculture and industry, will remain over the course of this century. Net negative CO 2 emissions will therefore be 
needed to balance these remaining non-CO 2 GHG emissions to obtain net zero GHG emissions at a point in time after net zero CO 2 
has been reached in emissions pathways. Both the amount of net negative CO 2 emissions and the time lag to reaching net zero GHG 
depend on the choice of GHG emission metric.
Reaching net zero GHG emissions globally in terms of GWP-100 leads to a reduction in global warming from an earlier 
peak. This is due to net negative CO 2 emissions balancing the GWP-100-equivalent emissions of short-lived GHG emissions, which by 
themselves do not contribute to further warming if sufficiently declining (Fuglestvedt et al. 2018; Rogelj et al. 2021). Hence, 1.5°C–2°C 
emissions pathways in the AR6 scenario database that reach global net zero GHG emissions in the second half of the century show 
warming being halted at some peak value followed by a gradual decline towards the end of the century (AR6 WGI Chapter 1, Box 1.4).
Global net zero GHG emissions measured in terms of GWP-100 are reached between 2095 and 2100 (2050–…)10 in 
emission pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot (median and 5–95th percentile). 
Around 50% of pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot and 70% of pathways limiting warming 
to 2°C (>67%) do not reach net zero GHG emissions in terms of GWP-100 before 2100. These pathways tend to show less reduction 
in warming after the peak than pathways that reach net zero GHG emissions. For the subset of pathways that reach net zero GHG 
emissions before 2100, including around 90% of pathways that return warming to 1.5°C after a high overshoot (>0.1°C) by 2100, 
the time lag between reaching net zero CO 2 and net zero GHG is 12–14 (7–39) years and the amount of net negative CO 2 emissions 
deployed to balance non-CO 2 emissions at the time of net zero GHG is around -7 (–10 to –4) GtCO 2 (range of medians and lowest 
5th to highest 95 percentile across the four scenario classes that limit median warming to 2°C or lower) (Section 3.3 and Table 3.2).
Sectoral and regional aspects of net zero
The timing of net zero CO 2 or GHG emissions may differ across regions and sectors. Achieving net zero emissions globally 
implies that some sectors and regions must reach net zero CO 2 or GHG ahead of the time of global net zero CO 2 or GHG if 
others reach it later. Similarly, some sectors and regions would need to achieve net negative CO 2 or GHG emissions to compensate 
for continued emissions by other sectors and regions after the global net zero year. Differences in the timing to reach net zero 
emissions between sectors and regions depend on multiple factors, including the potential of countries and sectors to reduce GHG 
emissions and undertake carbon dioxide removal (CDR), the associated costs, and the availability of policy mechanisms to balance 
emissions and removals between sectors and countries (Fyson et al. 2020; Strefler et al. 2021a; van Soest et al. 2021b). A lack of such 
mechanisms could lead to higher global costs to reach net zero emissions globally, but less interdependencies and institutional needs 
(Fajardy and Mac Dowell 2020). Sectors will reach net zero CO 2 and GHG emissions at different times if they are aiming for such 
targets with sector-specific policies or as part of an economy-wide net zero emissions strategy integrating emissions reductions and 
removals across sectors. In the latter case, sectors with large potential for achieving net negative emissions would go beyond net zero 
to balance residual emissions from sectors with low potential, which in turn would take more time compared to the case of sector-
specific action. Global pathways project global AFOLU emissions to reach global net zero CO 2 the earliest, around 2030 to 2035 in 
pathways to limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower, by rapid reduction of deforestation and enhancing carbon sinks on land, although 
net zero GHG emissions from global AFOLU are typically reached 30 years later, if at all. The ability of global AFOLU CO 2 emissions to 
reach net zero as early as in the 2030s in modelled pathways hinges on optimistic assumptions about the ability to establish global 
cost-effective mechanisms to balance emissions reductions and removals across regions and sectors. These assumptions have been 
challenged in the literature and the Special Report on Climate Change and Land (IPCC SRCCL).
The adoption and implementation of net zero CO 2 or GHG emission targets by countries and regions also depends on 
equity and capacity criteria. The Paris Agreement recognises that peaking of emissions will occur later in developing countries 
(Art. 4.1). Just transitions to net zero CO 2 or GHG could be expected to follow multiple pathways, in different contexts. Regions may 
decide about net zero pathways based on their consideration of potential for rapid transition to low-carbon development pathways, 
the capacity to design and implement those changes, and perceptions of equity within and across countries. Cost-effective pathways 
from global models have been shown to distribute the mitigation effort unevenly and inequitably in the absence of financial support 
mechanisms and capacity building (Budolfson et al. 2021), and hence would require additional measures to become aligned with 

denoted by -….Cross-Chapter Box 3 (continued)
equity considerations (Fyson et al. 2020; van Soest et al. 2021b). Formulation of net zero pathways by countries will benefit from clarity 
on scope, roadmaps and fairness (Rogelj et al. 2021; Smith 2021). Achieving net zero emission targets relies on policies, institutions 
and milestones against which to track progress. Milestones can include emissions levels, as well as markers of technological diffusion.
The accounting of anthropogenic carbon dioxide removal on land matters for the evaluation of net zero CO 2 and net zero 
GHG strategies. Due to the use of different approaches between national inventories and global models, the current net CO 2 emissions 
are lower by 5.5 GtCO 2, and cumulative net CO 2 emissions in modelled 1.5°C–2°C pathways would be lower by 104–170 GtCO 2, if carbon 
dioxide removals on land are accounted based on national GHG inventories. National GHG inventories typically consider a much larger 
area of managed forest than global models, and on this area additionally consider the fluxes due to human-induced global environmental 
change (indirect effects) to be anthropogenic, while global models consider these fluxes to be natural. Both approaches capture the same 
land fluxes, only the accounting of anthropogenic vs natural emissions is different. Methods to convert estimates from global models 
to the accounting scheme of national GHG inventories will improve the use of emission pathways from global models as benchmarks 
against which collective progress is assessed. (Section 7.2.2.5).
Net zero CO 2 and carbon neutrality have different meanings in this assessment, as is the case for net zero GHG and 
GHG neutrality. They apply to different boundaries in the emissions and removals being considered. Net zero (GHG or CO 2) refers 
to emissions and removals under the direct control or territorial responsibility of the reporting entity. In contrast, (GHG or carbon) 
neutrality includes anthropogenic emissions and anthropogenic removals within and also those beyond the direct control or territorial 
responsibility of the reporting entity. At the global scale, net zero CO 2 and carbon neutrality are equivalent, as is the case for net zero 
GHG and GHG neutrality. The term ‘climate neutrality’ is not used in this assessment because the concept of climate neutrality is 
diffuse, used differently by different communities, and not readily quantified.Cross-Chapter Box 3 (continued)
Table  3.2 summarises the key characteristics for all temperature 
categories in terms of cumulative CO 2 emissions, near-term 
emission reductions, and the years of peak emission and net 
zero CO 2 and GHG emissions. The table shows again that many 
pathways in the literature limit global warming to 2° C (>67%) 
or limit warming to  1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot 
compared to pre-industrial levels. Cumulative net CO 2 emissions 
from the year 2020 until the time of net zero CO 2 in pathways 
that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot 
are 510 (330–710) GtCO 2 and in pathways that limit warming 
to 2°C (>67%), 890 (640–1160) GtCO 2 (see also Cross-Chapter 
Box 3 in this chapter). Mitigation pathways that limit warming to 
2°C (>67%) compared to pre-industrial levels are associated with 
net global GHG emissions of 44 (32–55) GtCO 2-eq yr–1 by 2030 
and 20 (13–26) GtCO 2-eq yr–1 in 2050. These correspond to GHG 
emissions reductions of 21% (1–42%) by 2030, and 64% (53–77%) 
by 2050 relative to 2019 emission levels. Pathways that limit 
global warming to  1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot 
require a  further acceleration in the pace of the transformation, 
with GHG emissions reductions of 43% (34–60%) by 2030 and 
84% (73–98%) in 2050 relative to modelled 2019 emission levels. 
The likelihood of limiting warming to below  1.5°C (>50%) with 
no or limited overshoot of the most stringent mitigation pathways 
in the literature (C1) has declined since SR1.5. This is because 
emissions have risen since 2010 by about 9 GtCO 2 yr–1, resulting 
in relatively higher near-term emissions of the AR6 pathways by 

compared to SR1.5.Given the larger contribution of scenarios in the literature that aim 
to reduce net negative emissions, emission reductions are somewhat 
larger in the short term compared to similar categories in the IPCC 
SR1.5. At the same time, the year of net zero emissions is somewhat 
later (but only if these rapid, short-term emission reductions are 
achieved). The scenarios in the literature in C1–C3 show a peak in 
global emissions before 2025. Not achieving this requires a  more 
rapid reduction after 2025 to still meet the Paris goals (Section 3.5).

Table 3.2 (continued):
a Values in the table refer to the 50th and [5th–95th] percentile values across the pathways falling within a given category as defined in Box SPM.1. For emissions-related 
columns these values relate to the distribution of all the pathways in that category. Harmonised emissions values are given for consistency with projected global warming 
outcomes using climate emulators. Based on the assessment of climate emulators in AR6 WGI (WG1 Chapter 7, Box 7.1), two climate emulators are used for the probabilistic 
assessment of the resulting warming of the pathways. For the ‘Temperature change’ and ‘Likelihood’ columns, the single upper-row values represent the 50th percentile 
across the pathways in that category and the median [50th percentile] across the warming estimates of the probabilistic MAGICC climate model emulator. For the bracketed 
ranges, the median warming for every pathway in that category is calculated for each of the two climate model emulators (MAGICC and FaIR). Subsequently, the 5th and 
95th percentile values across all pathways for each emulator are calculated. The coolest and warmest outcomes (i.e., the lowest p5 of two emulators, and the highest p95, 
respectively) are shown in square brackets. These ranges therefore cover both the uncertainty of the emissions pathways as well as the climate emulators’ uncertainty.
b For a description of pathways categories see Box SPM.1 and Table 3.1.
c All global warming levels are relative to 1850–1900. (See footnote n below and Box SPM.145 for more details.)
d C3 pathways are sub-categorised according to the timing of policy action to match the emissions pathways in Figure SPM.4. Two pathways derived from a cost-benefit 
analysis have been added to C3a, whilst 10 pathways with specifically designed near-term action until 2030, whose emissions fall below those implied by NDCs announced 
prior to COP26, are not included in either of the two subsets.
e Alignment with the categories of the illustrative SSP scenarios considered in AR6 WGI, and the Illustrative (Mitigation) Pathways (IPs/IMPs) of WGIII. The IMPs have 
common features such as deep and rapid emissions reductions, but also different combinations of sectoral mitigation strategies. See Box SPM.1 for an introduction of the 
IPs and IMPs, and Chapter 3 for full descriptions. {3.2, 3.3, Annex III.II.2.4}
f The Illustrative Mitigation Pathway ‘Neg’ has extensive use of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) in the AFOLU, energy and the industry sectors to achieve net negative 
emissions. Warming peaks around 2060 and declines to below 1.5°C (50% likelihood) shortly after 2100. Whilst technically classified as C3, it strongly exhibits the 
characteristics of C2 high-overshoot pathways, hence it has been placed in the C2 category. See Box SPM.1 for an introduction of the IPs and IMPs.
g The 2019 range of harmonised GHG emissions across the pathways [53–58 GtCO 2-eq] is within the uncertainty ranges of 2019 emissions assessed in Chapter 2 
[53–66 GtCO 2-eq].49 (Figure SPM.1, Figure SPM.2, Box SPM.1) 
h Rates of global emission reduction in mitigation pathways are reported on a pathway-by-pathway basis relative to harmonised modelled global emissions in 2019 
rather than the global emissions reported in SPM Section B and Chapter 2; this ensures internal consistency in assumptions about emission sources and activities, as well 
as consistency with temperature projections based on the physical climate science assessment by WGI.49 {Annex III.II.2.5}. Negative values (e.g., in C7, C8) represent an 
increase in emissions.
i Emissions milestones are provided for five-year intervals in order to be consistent with the underlying five-year time-step data of the modelled pathways. Peak emissions 
(CO 2 and GHGs) are assessed for five-year reporting intervals starting in 2020. The interval 2020–2025 signifies that projected emissions peak as soon as possible between 

underneath refer to the range across the pathways, comprising the lower bound of the 5th percentile five-year interval and the upper bound of the 95th percentile five-year 
interval. Numbers in round brackets signify the fraction of pathways that reach specific milestones.
j Percentiles reported across all pathways in that category include those that do not reach net zero before 2100 (fraction of pathways reaching net zero is given in round 
brackets). If the fraction of pathways that reach net zero before 2100 is lower than the fraction of pathways covered by a percentile (e.g., 0.95 for the 95th percentile), 
the percentile is not defined and denoted with ‘…’. The fraction of pathways reaching net zero includes all with reported non-harmonised, and/or harmonised emissions 
profiles that reach net zero. Pathways were counted when at least one of the two profiles fell below 100 MtCO 2 yr–1 until 2100.
k The timing of net zero is further discussed in SPM C2.4 and Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 3 on net zero CO 2 and net zero GHG emissions.
l For cases where models do not report all GHGs, missing GHG species are infilled and aggregated into a Kyoto basket of GHG emissions in CO 2-eq defined by the 100-year 
global warming potential. For each pathway, reporting of CO 2, CH 4, and N 2O emissions was the minimum required for the assessment of the climate response and the 
assignment to a climate category. Emissions pathways without climate assessment are not included in the ranges presented here. {See Annex III.II.2.5 }
m Cumulative emissions are calculated from the start of 2020 to the time of net zero and 2100, respectively. They are based on harmonised net CO 2 emissions, ensuring 
consistency with the WGI assessment of the remaining carbon budget.50 {Box 3.4}
n Global mean temperature change for category (at peak, if peak temperature occurs before 2100, and in 2100) relative to 1850–1900, based on the median global 
warming for each pathway assessed using the probabilistic climate model emulators calibrated to the AR6 WGI assessment.12 (See also Box SPM.1) {Annex III.II.2.5; 
WGI Cross-Chapter Box 7.1} 
o Probability of staying below the temperature thresholds for the pathways in each category, taking into consideration the range of uncertainty from the climate model 
emulators consistent with the AR6 WGI assessment. The probabilities refer to the probability at peak temperature. Note that in the case of temperature overshoot 
(e.g., category C2 and some pathways in C1), the probabilities of staying below at the end of the century are higher than the probabilities at peak temperature.
3.3.2.4 Mitigation Strategies
Detailed sectoral implications are discussed in Section  3.4 and 
Chapters 5–11 (see also Table 3.3). The stringency of climate policy 
has clear implications for mitigation action (Figure 3.15). There are 
a number of important commonalities of pathways limiting warming 
to 2°C (>67%) or lower: for instance, they all rely on significant 
improvement of energy efficiency, rapid decarbonisation of supply 
and, many of them, CDR (in energy supply or AFOLU), either in terms 
of net negative emissions or to compensate residual emissions. 
Still, there are also important differences and the (IMPs) show how 
different choices can steer the system into alternative directions with 
different combinations of response options. For decarbonisation of 
energy supply many options exist, including CCS, nuclear power, and 
renewables (Chapter 6). In the majority of the scenarios reaching low 
GHG targets, a considerable amount of CCS is applied (Figure 3.15d). The share of renewables is around 30–70% in the scenarios that 
limit warming to 2°C (>67%) and clearly above 40% for scenarios 
that limit warming   1.5°C (>50%) (panel  c). Scenarios have been 
published with 100% renewable energy systems even at a  global 
scale, partly reflecting the rapid progress made for these technologies 
in the last decade (Creutzig et al. 2017; Jacobson et al. 2018; Breyer 
and Jefferson 2020). These scenarios do not show in the graph due to 
a lack of information from non-energy sources. There is a debate in 
the literature on whether it is possible to achieve a 100% renewable 
energy system by 2050 (Brook et al. 2018). This critically depends on 
assumptions made on future system integration, system flexibility, 
storage options, consequences for material demand and the ability 
to supply high-temperature functions and specific mobility functions 
with renewable energy. The range of studies published showing 
100% renewable energy systems show that it is possible to design 
such systems in the context of energy system models (Hong et al. 
2014a,b; Lehtveer and Hedenus 2015a,b; Pfenninger and Keirstead 
2015; Sepulveda et al. 2018; Zappa et al. 2019; IEA 2021b) (see also 
Box  6.6 on 100% renewables in net zero CO 2 systems). Panels e 
and f, finally, show the contribution of CDR – both in terms of net 
negative emissions and gross CDR. The contribution of total CDR 
obviously exceeds the net negative emissions. It should be noted that 
while a majority of scenarios rely on net negative emissions to reach 
stringent mitigation goals – this is not the case for all of them.
The spread shown in Figure  3.15 implies different mitigation 
strategies that could all lead to emissions levels consistent with the 
Paris Agreement (and reach zero emissions). The IMPs illustrate some options for different decarbonisation pathways with heavy reliance 
on renewables (IMP-Ren), strong emphasis on energy-demand 
reductions (IMP-LD), widespread deployment of CDR methods 
coupled with CCS (BECCS and DACCS) (IMP-Neg), mitigation in 
the context of sustainable development (IMP-SP) (Figure 3.16). For 
example, in some scenarios, a small part of the energy system is still 
based on fossil fuels in 2100 (IMP-Neg), while in others, fossil fuels 
are almost or completely phased out (IMP-Ren). Nevertheless, in all 
scenarios, fossil fuel use is greatly reduced and unabated coal use 
is completely phased out by 2050. Also, nuclear power can be part 
of a mitigation strategy (however, the literature only includes some 
scenarios with high-nuclear contributions, such as Berger et al. 2017). 0 2000 4000 6000 8000−0.200.20.40.60.811.2

This is explored further in Section 3.5. The different strategies are also 
clearly apparent in the way they scenarios reach net zero emissions. 
While IMP-GS and IMP-Neg rely significantly on BECCS and DACCS, 
their use is far more restricted in the other IMPs. Consistently, in these 
IMPs residual emissions are also significantly lower.Mitigation pathways also have a regional dimension. In 2010, about 
40% of emissions originated from the Developed Countries and Eastern 
Europe and West Central Asia regions. According to the projections 
shown in Figure 3.17, the share of the latter regions will further increase 
to about 70% by 2050. In the scenarios in the literature, emissions are 
typically almost equally reduced across the regions.
3.3.3 Climate Impacts on Mitigation Potential
At the moment, climate change impact on mitigation potential is hardly 
considered in model-based scenarios. While a detailed overview of 
climate impacts is provided in IPCC AR6 WGII and Section 3.6 discusses 
the economic consequences, here we concentrate on the implications 
for mitigation potential. Climate change directly impacts the carbon 
budget via all kinds of feedbacks – which is included in the ranges 
provided for the carbon budget (e.g., 300–900 GtCO 2 for 17th–83rd 
percentile for not exceeding 1.5°C; see AR6 WGI Chapter 5, 2021). 
Climate change, however, alters the production and consumption 
of energy (Section 6.5). An overview of the literature is provided by 
Yalew et al. (2020). In terms of supply, impacts could influence the 
cooling capacity of thermal plants, the potential and predictability of 
renewable energy, and energy infrastructure (van Vliet et al. 2016; 
Turner et al. 2017; Cronin et al. 2018a; Lucena et al. 2018; Yalew 
et al. 2020; Gernaat et al. 2021). Although the outcomes of these 
studies differ, they seem to suggest that although impacts might be 
relatively small at the global scale, they could be substantial at the 
regional scale (increasing or decreasing potential). Climate change 
can also impact energy demand, with rising temperatures resulting 
in decreases in heating demand and increases in cooling demand 
(Isaac and van Vuuren 2009; Zhou et al. 2014; Labriet et al. 2015; 
McFarland et al. 2015; Auffhammer et al. 2017; Clarke et al. 2018; 
van Ruijven et al. 2019; Yalew et al. 2020). As expected, the increase 
in cooling demand dominates the impact in warm regions and 
decreases in heating demand in cold regions (Isaac and van Vuuren 
2009; Zhou et al. 2014; Clarke et al. 2018). Globally, most studies 
show a net increase in energy demand at the end of the century due 
to climate impacts (Isaac and van Vuuren 2009; Clarke et al. 2018; 
van Ruijven et al. 2019); however, one study shows a net decrease 
(Labriet et al. 2015). Only a  few studies quantify the combined 
impacts of climate change on energy supply and energy demand 
(McFarland et al. 2015; Mima and Criqui 2015; Emodi et al. 2019; 

generation in the USA (McFarland et al. 2015; Steinberg et al. 2020) 
and increases in CO 2 emissions in Australia (Emodi et al. 2019) or the 
USA (McFarland et al. 2015).
Climate change can impact the potential for AFOLU mitigation 
action by altering terrestrial carbon uptake, crop yields and 
bioenergy potential (Chapter  7). Carbon sequestration in forests 
may be positively or adversely affected by climate change 
and  CO 2 fertilisation. On the one hand, elevated CO 2 levels and 
higher temperatures could enhance tree growth rates, carbon 
sequestration, and timber and biomass production (Beach et al. 
2015; Kim et al. 2017; Anderegg et al. 2020). On the other hand, 
climate change could lead to greater frequency and intensity of 
disturbance events in forests, such as fires, prolonged droughts, 
storms, pests and diseases (Kim et al. 2017; Anderegg et al. 2020). 
The impact of climate change on crop yields could also indirectly 
impact the availability of land for mitigation and AFOLU emissions 
(Calvin et al. 2013; Bajželj and Richards 2014; Kyle et al. 2014; Beach 
et al. 2015; Meijl et al. 2018). The impact is, however, uncertain, as 
discussed in AR6 WGII Chapter 5. A few studies estimate the effect 
of climate impacts on AFOLU on mitigation, finding increases in 
carbon prices or mitigation costs by 1–6% in most scenarios (Calvin 
et al. 2013; Kyle et al. 2014).
In summary, a  limited number of studies quantify the impact of 
climate on emissions pathways. The most important impact in 
energy systems might be through the impact on demand, although 
climate change could also impact renewable mitigation potential – 
certainly at the local and regional scale. Climate change might be 
more important for land-use related mitigation measures, including 
afforestation, bioenergy and nature-based solutions. The net effect of 
changes in climate and CO 2 fertilisation are uncertain but could be 
substantial (Chapter 7).Africa and

3.4 Integrating Sectoral Analysis 
Into Systems Transformations
This section describes the role of sectors in long-term emissions 
pathways (Table  3.3). We discuss both sectoral aspects of IAM 
pathways and some insights from sectoral studies. Sectoral studies 
typically include more detail and additional mitigation options 
compared to IAMs. However, sectoral studies miss potential 
feedbacks and cross-sectoral linkages that are captured by IAMs. 
Additionally, since IAMs include all emissions sources, these models 
can be used to identify pathways to particular climate goals. In such 
pathways, emissions are balanced across sectors typically based 
on relative marginal abatement costs; as a result, some sectors are 
sources and some are sinks at the time of net zero CO 2 emissions. 
For these reasons, the mitigation observed in each sector in an IAM 
may differ from the potential in sectoral studies. Given the strengths 
and limitations of each type of model, IAMs and sectoral models are 
complementary, providing different perspectives.3.4.1 Cross-sector Linkages
3.4.1.1 Demand and Supply Strategies
Most IAM pathways rely heavily on supply-side mitigation 
strategies, including fuel switching, decarbonisation of fuels, and 
CDR (Creutzig et al. 2016; Bertram et al. 2018; Rogelj et al. 2018b; 
Mundaca et al. 2019). For demand-side mitigation, IAMs incorporate 
changes in energy efficiency, but many other demand-side options 
(e.g.,  behaviour and lifestyle changes) are often excluded from 
models (van Sluisveld et al. 2015; Creutzig et al. 2016; van den Berg 
et al. 2019; Wilson et al. 2019). In addition, this mitigation is typically 
price-driven and limited in magnitude (Yeh et al. 2017; Luderer 
et al. 2018; Wachsmuth and Duscha 2019; Sharmina et al. 2020). In 
contrast, bottom-up modelling studies show considerable potential 
for demand-side mitigation (Creutzig et al. 2016; Yeh et al. 2017; 
Mundaca et al. 2019; Wachsmuth and Duscha 2019) (Chapter  5), 
which can slow emissions growth and/or reduce emissions (Creutzig 
et al. 2016; Samadi et al. 2017).
A small number of mitigation pathways include stringent demand-
side mitigation, including changes in thermostat set points 
(van Sluisveld et al. 2016; van Vuuren et al. 2018), more efficient or 
smarter  appliances (van Sluisveld et al. 2016; Grubler et al. 2018; 
Napp  et al. 2019), increased recycling or reduced industrial goods 
(Liu  et al. 2018; van  Sluisveld et al. 2016; Grubler et al. 2018; 
van  de  Ven et al. 2018; Napp et al. 2019), telework and travel 
avoidance (Grubler et al. 2018; van de Ven et al. 2018), shifts to public 
transit (van  Sluisveld et al. 2016; Grubler et al. 2018; van Vuuren 
et al. 2018), reductions in food waste (van de Ven et al. 2018) and 
less meat-intensive diets (Liu et al. 2018; van de Ven et al. 2018; 
van Vuuren et al. 2018). These pathways show reduced dependence 
on CDR and reduced pressure on land (Grubler et al. 2018; Rogelj et al. 
2018a; van de Ven et al. 2018; van Vuuren et al. 2018) (Section 5.3.3). 
However, the representation of these demand-side mitigation 
options in IAMs is limited, with most models excluding the costs of 
such changes (van Sluisveld et al. 2016), using stylised assumptions 
to represent them (van den Berg et al. 2019), and excluding rebound 
effects (Krey et al. 2019; Brockway et al. 2021). Furthermore, there 
are questions about the achievability of such pathways, including 
whether the behavioural changes included are feasible (Azevedo 
et al. 2021) and the extent to which development and demand can 
be decoupled (Steckel et al. 2013; Brockway et al. 2021; Keyßer and 
Lenzen 2021; Semieniuk et al. 2021).
Figure 3.18 shows indicators of supply- and demand-side mitigation 
in the IMPs, as well as the range across the database. Two of these 
IMPs (IMP-SP, IMP-LD) show strong reductions in energy demand, 
resulting in less reliance on bioenergy and limited CDR from 
energy supply. In contrast, IMP-Neg has higher energy demand, 
depending more on bioenergy and net negative CO 2 emissions from 
energy supply.Table 3.3 | Section 3.4 structure, definitions, and relevant chapters.

3.4.1.2 Sectoral Emissions Strategies and the Timing  
of Net Zero
Mitigation pathways show differences in the timing of decarbonisation 
(Figure 3.20) and the timing of net zero (Figure 3.19) across sectors 
and regions (high confidence); the timing in a given sector depends 
on the cost of abatement in it, the availability of CDR options, the 
scenario design, near-term emissions levels, and the amount of non-
CO2 abatement (Yeh et al. 2017; Emmerling et al. 2019; Rogelj et al. 
2019a,b; Johansson et al. 2020; Azevedo et al. 2021; Ou et al. 2021; 
van Soest et al. 2021b) (Cross-Chapter Box 3 in this chapter). However, 
delaying emissions reductions, or more limited emissions reductions 
in one sector or region, involves compensating reductions in other 
sectors or regions if warming is to be limited (high confidence) (Price 
and Keppo 2017; Grubler et al. 2018; Rochedo et al. 2018; van Soest 
et al. 2021b).
At the time of net zero global CO 2 emissions, emissions in some 
sectors are positive and some negative. In cost-effective mitigation 
pathways, the energy supply sector typically reaches net zero CO 2 
before the economy as a whole, while the demand sectors reach net 
zero CO 2 later, if at all (Pietzcker et al. 2014; Price and Keppo 2017; 
Luderer et al. 2018; Rogelj et al. 2018a,b; Méjean et al. 2019; Azevedo 

buildings are positive, and non-CO 2 GHG emissions are also positive 
at the time of global net zero CO 2 emissions (Figure 3.20).
So, while pathways indicate some flexibility in emissions 
reductions across sectors, all pathways involve substantial CO 2 
emissions reductions in all sectors and regions (high confidence) 
(Luderer et al. 2018; Rogelj et al. 2018a,b; Méjean et al. 2019; 
Azevedo et al. 2021). Projected CO 2 emissions reductions between 

overshoot are around 77% for energy demand, with a  5–95% 
range of 31–96%,12 115% for energy supply (90–167%), and 
148% for AFOLU (94–387%). In pathways that limit warming to 
2°C (>67%), projected CO 2 emissions are reduced between 2019 
and 2050 by around 49% for energy demand, 97% for energy 
supply, and 136% for AFOLU (Sections 3.4.2–3.4.6). Almost 75% 
of GHG reductions at the time of net zero GHG are from the 
energy system, 13% are from AFOLU CO 2, and 13% from non-CO 2 
(Figure 3.21). These reductions are achieved through a variety of 
sectoral strategies, illustrated in Figure 3.21 (Figure 3.21b), and 
described in Sections 3.4.2 to 3.4.7; the primary strategies include 
declines in fossil energy, increases in low-carbon energy use, and 
CDR to address residual emissions.

global net zero CO 2 (top right), cumulative CO 2 emissions from 2020–2100 (bottom left), and cumulative CO 2 emissions from 2020 until the year of net

energy use only; sectors shown in this figure do not necessarily sum to total CO 2. In this, and other figures in Section 3.4, unless stated otherwise, only scenarios that pass the 
vetting criteria are included (Section 3.2). Boxes indicate the interquartile range, the median is shown with a horizontal black line, while vertical lines show the 5–95% interval.
In the context of mitigation pathways, only a  few studies have 
examined solar radiation modification (SRM), typically focusing on 
Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (Arinoa et al. 2016; Emmerling and 
Tavoni 2018a,b; Heutel et al. 2018; Helwegen et al. 2019; Rickels 
et al. 2020; Belaia et al. 2021). These studies find that substantial 
mitigation is required to limit warming to a given level, even if SRM 
is available (Moreno-Cruz and Smulders 2017; Emmerling and Tavoni 
2018b; Belaia et al. 2021). SRM may reduce some climate impacts, 
reduce peak temperatures, lower mitigation costs, and extend the 
time available to achieve mitigation; however, SRM does not address 
ocean acidification and may involve risks to crop yields, economies, 
human health, or ecosystems (AR6 WGII Chapter 16; AR6 WGI TS and 
Chapter 5; SR1.5 SPM; and Cross-Working Group Box 4 in Chapter 14 
of this report). There are also significant uncertainties surrounding 
SRM, including uncertainties on the costs and risks, which can 
substantially alter the amount of SRM used in modelled pathways 
(Tavoni et al. 2017; Heutel et al. 2018; IPCC 2018; Helwegen 
et al. 2019; NASEM 2021). Furthermore, the degree of international 
cooperation can influence the amount of SRM deployed in scenarios, 
with uncoordinated action resulting in larger SRM deployment and 
consequently larger risks/impacts from SRM (Emmerling and Tavoni 
2018a). Bridging research and governance involves consideration 
of the full range of societal choices and ramifications (Sugiyama 
et al. 2018). More information on SRM, including the caveats, risks, 
uncertainties, and governance issues is found in AR6 WGI Chapter 4; 
AR6 WGIII Chapter 14; and Cross-Working Group Box 4 in Chapter 14 
of this report.3.4.1.3 Linkages Among Sectors
Mitigation in one sector can be dependent upon mitigation in 
another sector, or may involve trade-offs between sectors. Mitigation 
in energy demand often includes electrification (Pietzcker et al. 2014; 
Luderer et al. 2018; Sharmina et al. 2020; DeAngelo et al. 2021), 
however such pathways only result in reduced emissions if  the 
electricity sector is decarbonised (Zhang and Fujimori 2020) 
(Chapter  12). Relatedly, the mitigation potential of some sectors 
(e.g., transportation) depends on the decarbonisation of liquid fuels, 
for example, through biofuels (Pietzcker et al. 2014; Wise et al. 2017; 
Sharmina et al. 2020) (Chapter 12). In other cases, mitigation in one 
sector results in reduced emissions in another sector. For example, 
increased recycling can reduce primary resource extraction; planting 
trees or green roofs in urban areas can reduce the energy demand 
associated with space cooling (Chapter 12).
Mitigation in one sector can also result in additional emissions 
in  another. One example is electrification of end use which can 
result in increased emissions from energy supply. However, one 
comparitively well-researched example of this linkage is bioenergy. 
An increase in demand for bioenergy within the energy system has 
the potential to influence emissions in the AFOLU sector through the 
intensification of land and forest management and/or via land-use 
change (Daioglou et al. 2019; Smith et al. 2019; Smith et al. 2020a; 
IPCC 2019a). The effect of bioenergy and BECCS on mitigation 
depends on a variety of factors in modelled pathways. In the energy 
system, the emissions mitigation depends on the scale of deployment, 
the conversion technology, and the fuel displaced (Calvin et al. 2021). 0%  20%  40%  60%  80%  100%  % of modelled 2019 emissionsContributions to r eaching net zer o GHG emissions (for all scenarios r eaching net-zer o GHGs)

GHG.  Emissions reductions by sector for direct (demand) and indirect (upstream supply) are shown as the percent of total GHG reductions. Right panel: key indicators in 2050 
for the IMPs. Definitions of significant and very significant are defined relative to 2019 and vary between indicators, as follows: fossil energy (significant >10%, very significant 
>50%), renewables (>150 EJ yr–1, >200 EJ yr–1), bioenergy (>100%, >200%), BECCS (>2.0 GtCO 2 yr–1, >3.5 GtCO 2 yr–1), AFOLU (>100% decline, >130% decline), energy 
crops (>150 million ha, >400 million ha), forest (>5% increase, >15% increase). Source: AR6 Scenarios Database.

Limiting or excluding bioenergy and/or BECCS increases mitigation 
cost and may limit the ability of a model to reach a low warming 
level (Edmonds et al. 2013; Calvin et al. 2014b; Luderer et al. 2018; 
Muratori et al. 2020). In AFOLU, bioenergy can increase or decrease 
terrestrial carbon stocks and carbon sequestration, depending on the 
scale, biomass feedstock, land management practices, and prior land 
use (Calvin et al. 2014c; Wise et al. 2015; IPCC 2019a; Smith et al. 
2019, 2020a; Calvin et al. 2021).
Pathways with very high biomass production for energy use typically 
include very high carbon prices in the energy system (Popp et al. 
2017; Rogelj et al. 2018b), little or no land policy (Calvin et al. 2014b), 
a high discount rate (Emmerling et al. 2019), and limited non-BECCS 
CDR options (e.g.,  afforestation, DACCS) (Chen and Tavoni 2013; 
Calvin et al. 2014b; Marcucci et al. 2017; Realmonte et al. 2019; 
Fuhrman et al. 2020). Higher levels of bioenergy consumption are 
likely to involve trade-offs with mitigation in other sectors, notably 
in construction (i.e., wood for material and structural products) and 
AFOLU (carbon stocks and future carbon sequestration), as well as 
trade-offs with sustainability (Section  3.7) and feasibility concerns 
(Section 3.8). Not all of these trade-offs are fully represented in all 
IAMs. Based on sectoral studies, the technical potential for bioenergy, 
when constraints for food security and environmental considerations 
are included, are 5–50 EJ yr–1 and 50–250 EJ yr–1 in 2050 for residues 
and dedicated biomass production systems, respectively (Chapter 7). 
Bioenergy deployment in IAMs is within the range of these potentials, with between 75 and 248 EJ yr–1 in 2050 in pathways that limit 
warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot. Finally, IAMs do not 
include all potential feedstock and management practices, and have 
limited representation of institutions, governance, and local context 
(Brown et al. 2019; Butnar et al. 2020; Calvin et al. 2021).
The inclusion of CDR options, like BECCS, can affect the timing of 
emissions mitigation in IAM scenarios, that is, delays in mitigations 
actions are compensated by net negative emissions in the second half 
of the century. However, studies with limited net negative emissions 
in the long term require very rapid declines in emissions in the near 
term (van Vuuren et al. 2017). Especially in forest-based systems, 
increased harvesting of forests can perturb the carbon balance of 
forestry systems, increasing emissions for some period; the duration 
of this period of increased emissions, preceding net emissions 
reductions, can be very variable (Mitchell et al. 2012; Lamers and 
Junginger 2013; Röder et al. 2019; Hanssen et al. 2020; Cowie et al. 
2021). However, the factors contributing to differences in recovery 
time are known (Mitchell et al. 2012; Zanchi et al. 2012; Lamers and 
Junginger 2013; Laganière et al. 2017; Röder et al. 2019). Some studies 
that consider market-mediated effects find that an increased demand 
for biomass from forests can provide incentives to maintain existing 
forests and potentially to expand forest areas, providing additional 
carbon sequestration as well as additional biomass (Dwivedi et al. 
2014; Kim et al. 2018; Baker et al. 2019; Favero et al. 2020). However, 
these responses are uncertain and likely to vary geographically.

Figure 3.22 | Primary energy consumption across scenarios: total primary energy (a), fossil fuels (b), coal without CCS (c), non-biomass renewables (d), 
and biomass (e).  Scenarios are grouped by their temperature category. Primary energy is reported in direct equivalent, where one unit of nuclear or non-biomass renewable 
energy output is reported as one unit of primary energy. Not all subcategories of primary energy are shown.
3.4.2 Energy Supply
Without mitigation, energy consumption and supply emissions 
continue to rise (high confidence) (Kriegler et al. 2016; Bauer et al. 
2017; Riahi et al. 2017; Mcjeon et al. 2021) (Section 6.7). While the 
share of renewable energy continues to grow in reference scenarios, 
fossil fuel accounts for the largest share of primary energy (Bauer 
et al. 2017; Price and Keppo 2017; Riahi et al. 2017). In scenarios 
that limit warming to 2°C or lower, transition of the energy-supply 
sector to a  low- or no-carbon system is rapid (Rogelj et al. 2016, 
2018b; Grubler et al. 2018; Luderer et al. 2018; van Vuuren et al. 
2018). CO 2 emissions from energy supply reach net zero around 

with no or limited overshoot and around 2053 (2040–2066) in 
pathways  that limit warming to 2°C (>67%). Emissions reductions 
continue, with emissions reaching –7.1 GtCO 2 yr–1  (–15 to 
–2.3 GtCO 2 yr–1) in 2100 in all pathways that  limit warming to 2°C 
(>67%) or lower.
All pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower show 
substantial reductions in fossil fuel consumption and a near elimination 
of the use of coal without CCS (high confidence) (Bauer et al. 2017; 
van Vuuren et al. 2018; Grubler et al. 2018; Luderer et al. 2018; Rogelj 
et al. 2018a,b;  Azevedo et al. 2021; Mcjeon et al. 2021; Welsby et al. 
2021) (Figure 3.22). In these pathways, the use of coal, gas and oil is 
reduced by 90%, 25%, and 41%, respectively, between 2019 and 2050 
and 91%, 39%, and 78% between 2019 and 2100; coal without CCS is further reduced to 99% below its 2019 levels in 2100. These pathways 
show an increase in low-carbon energy, with 88% (69–97%) of primary 
energy from low-carbon sources in 2100, with different combinations 
of low-carbon fuels (e.g., non-biomass renewables, biomass, nuclear, 
and CCS) (Rogelj et al. 2018a,b; van Vuuren et al. 2018) (Sections 3.4.1 
and 6.7). Across all pathways that limit warming to 2°C and below, 
non-biomass renewables account for 52% (24–77%) of primary 
energy in 2100 (Creutzig et al. 2017; Pietzcker et al. 2017; Rogelj et al. 
2018b) (Chapter 6 and Figure 3.22). There are some studies analysing 
the potential for 100% renewable energy systems (Hansen et al. 2019); 
however, there are a range of issues around such systems (Box 6.6).
Stringent emissions reductions at the level required to limit warming 
to 2°C (>67%) or 1.5°C are achieved through increased electrification 
of end use, resulting in increased electricity generation in all 
pathways (high confidence) (Rogelj et al. 2018a; Azevedo et al. 2021) 
(Figure 3.23). Nearly all electricity in pathways likely to limit warming 
to 2°C and below is from low- or no-carbon fuels (Rogelj et al. 2018a; 
Azevedo et al. 2021), with different shares of nuclear, biomass, non-
biomass renewables, and fossil CCS across pathways. Low-emissions 
scenarios also show increases in hydrogen use (Figure 3.23).

(Figure 3.24). There is very little difference in final energy intensity 
for the buildings sector across scenarios. Direct CO 2 emissions 
from the buildings sector vary more widely across temperature 
stabilisation levels than energy consumption. In 2100, scenarios 
above 3°C [C7–C8] still show an increase of CO 2 emissions from 
buildings around 29% above 2019, while all scenarios likely to limit 
warming to 2°C and below have emission reductions of around 
85% (8–100%). Carbon intensity declines in all scenarios, but much 
more sharply as the warming level is reduced.
In all scenarios, the share of electricity in final energy use increases, 
a trend that is accelerated by 2050 for the scenarios likely to limit 
warming to 2°C and below (Figure 3.23). By 2100, the low-warming 
scenarios show large shares of electricity in final energy consumption 
for buildings. The opposite is observed for gases.
While several global IAM models have developed their buildings 
modules considerably over the past decade (Daioglou et al. 2012; 
Knobloch et al. 2017; Clarke et al. 2018; Edelenbosch et al. 2021; 
Mastrucci et al. 2021), the extremely limited availability of key 
sectoral variables in the AR6 scenarios database (such as floor space 
and energy use for individual services) prohibit a detailed analysis 
of sectoral dynamics. Individual studies in the literature often 
focus on single aspects of the buildings sector, though collectively 
providing a  more comprehensive overview (Edelenbosch et al. 

driven by economic development that fulfills basic needs (Mastrucci 
et al. 2019; Rao et al. 2019a), but also drives up floor space in 
general (Daioglou et al. 2012; Levesque et al. 2018; Mastrucci et al. 
2021) and ownership of energy-intensive appliances such as air 
conditioners (Isaac and van Vuuren 2009; Colelli and Cian 2020; 
Poblete-Cazenave et al. 2021). These dynamics are heterogeneous 
and lead to differences in energy demand and emission mitigation 
potential across urban/rural buildings and income levels (Krey et al. 
2012; Poblete-Cazenave et al. 2021). Mitigation scenarios rely on 
fuel switching and technology (Knobloch et al. 2017; Dagnachew 
et al. 2020), efficiency improvement in building envelopes 
(Levesque et al. 2018; Edelenbosch et al. 2021) and behavioural 
changes (van  Sluisveld et al. 2016; Niamir et al. 2018, 2020). 
The in-depth dynamics of mitigation in the building sector are 
explored in Chapter 9.
3.4.4 Transport
Reference scenarios show growth in transport demand, particularly 
in aviation and freight (Yeh et al. 2017; Sharmina et al. 2020; 
Müller-Casseres et al. 2021b). Energy consumption continues to be 
dominated by fossil fuels in reference scenarios, with some increases 
in electrification (Yeh et al. 2017; Edelenbosch et al. 2020; Yeh et al. 0123

2017). CO 2 emissions from transport increase for most models in 
reference scenarios (Yeh et al. 2017; Edelenbosch et al. 2020).
The relative contribution of demand-side reduction, energy- efficiency 
improvements, fuel switching, and decarbonisation of fuels, varyies 
by model, level of mitigation, mitigation options available, and 
underlying socio-economic pathway (Longden 2014; Wise et al. 2017; 
Yeh et al. 2017;  Luderer et al. 2018; Yeh et al. 2017; Edelenbosch 
et al. 2020; Müller-Casseres et al. 2021a,b). IAMs typically rely on 
technology-focused measures like energy- efficiency improvements 
and fuel switching to reduce carbon emissions (Pietzcker et al. 2014; 
Edelenbosch et al. 2017a; Yeh et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2018a,b; Rogelj 
et al. 2018b; Zhang et al. 2018a,b;  Sharmina et al. 2020). Many 
mitigation pathways show electrification of the transport system 
(Luderer et al. 2018; Pietzcker et al. 2014; Longden 2014; Luderer 
et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2018a); however, without decarboniszation 
of the electricity system, transport electrification can increase 
total energy system emissions (Zhang and Fujimori 2020). A small 
number of pathways include demand-side mitigation measures in 
the transport sector; these studies show reduced carbon prices and 
reduced dependence on CDR (Grubler et al. 2018; Méjean et al. 
2019; van de Ven et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2018c; Méjean et al. 2019) 
(Section 3.4.1).


continues to grow, including in many stringent mitigation pathways 
(Figure  3.25). The carbon intensity of energy declines substantially 
by 2100 in likely 2°C (>67%) and below scenarios, leading to 
substantial declines in transport  sector CO 2 emissions with increased 
electrification of the transport system (Figure 3.23).
The transport sector has more detail than other sectors in many 
IAMs (Edelenbosch et al. 2020); however, there is considerable 
variation across models. Some models (e.g.,  GCAM, IMAGE, 
MESSAGE-GLOBIOM) represent different transport modes with 
endogenous shifts across modes as a  function of income, price, 
and modal speed (Edelenbosch et al. 2020).15 However, IAMs, 
including those with detailed transport, exclude several supply-side 
(e.g.,  synthetic fuels) and demand-side (e.g.,  behaviour change, 
reduced shipping, telework and automation) mitigation options 
(Pietzcker et al. 2014; Creutzig et al. 2016; Mittal et al. 2017; Davis 
et al. 2018; Köhler et al. 2020; Mittal et al. 2017; Gota et al. 2019;

See Chapter 10 for a discussion of energy intensity. Carbon intensity is CO 2 emissions per EJ of final energy. The first three indicators are indexed to 2019,13, where values less 
than 1 indicate a reduction.
As a result of these missing options and differences in how mitigation 
is implemented, IAMs tend to show less mitigation than the potential 
from national transport/energy models (Wachsmuth and Duscha 
2019; Gota et al. 2019; Yeh et al. 2017; Gota et al. 2019; Wachsmuth 
and Duscha 2019; Edelenbosch et al. 2020). For the transport sector 
as a whole, studies suggest a mitigation potential of 4–-5 GtCO 2 per 
year in 2030 (Edelenbosch et al. 2020) with complete decarbonization 
decarbonisation possible by 2050 (Gota et al. 2019; Wachsmuth and 
Duscha 2019). However, in the  scenarios assessed in this chapter that 
limit warming to below 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot, 
transport sector CO 2 emissions are reduced by only 59% (28–% 
to 81%) in 2050 compared to 2015. IAM pathways also show less 
electrification than the potential from other studies; pathways that 
limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot show a median 
of 25% (7– to 43%) of final energy from electricity in 2050, while the 
IEA NZE scenario includes 45% (IEA 2021a).

Reference scenarios show declines in energy intensity, but increases 
in final energy use in the industrial sector (Edelenbosch et al. 
2017b). These scenarios show increases in CO 2 emissions both for 
the total industrial sector (Edelenbosch et al. 2017b, 2020; Luderer 
et al. 2018) and individual subsectors such as cement and iron and 
steel (van Ruijven et al. 2016; van Sluisveld et al. 2021) or chemicals 
(Daioglou et al. 2014; van Sluisveld et al. 2021).
In mitigation pathways, CO 2 emissions reductions are achieved 
through a  combination of energy savings (via energy-efficiency 
improvements and energy conservation), structural change, fuel 
switching, and decarbonisation of fuels (Edelenbosch et al. 2017b, 
2020; Grubler et al. 2018; Luderer et al. 2018). Mitigation pathways 
show reductions in final energy for industry compared to the baseline 
(Edelenbosch et al. 2017b; Luderer et al. 2018; Edelenbosch et al. 
2020) and reductions in the carbon intensity of the industrial sector 
through both fuel switching and the use of CCS (van Ruijven et al. 
2016; Edelenbosch et al. 2017b, 2020; Luderer et al. 2018; Paltsev 
et al. 2021; van Sluisveld et al. 2021). The mitigation potential differs 
depending on the industrial subsector and the availability of CCS, 
with larger potential reductions in the steel sector (van Ruijven 
et al. 2016) and cement industry (Sanjuán et al. 2020) than in the

chemicals sector (Daioglou et al. 2014). Many scenarios, including 
stringent mitigation scenarios, show continued growth in final 
energy; however, the carbon intensity of energy declines in all 
mitigation scenarios (Figure 3.26).
The representation of the industry sector is very aggregated in most 
IAMs, with only a small subset of models disaggregating key sectors 
such as cement, fertiliser, chemicals, and iron and steel (Daioglou 
et al. 2014; Edelenbosch et al. 2017b;  Pauliuk et al. 2017; Napp 
et al. 2019; van Sluisveld et al. 2021). IAMs often account for both 
energy combustion and feedstocks (Edelenbosch et al. 2017b), but 
IAMs typically ignore material flows and miss linkages between 
sectors (Pauliuk et al. 2017; Kermeli et al. 2019). By excluding 
these processes, IAMs misrepresent the mitigation potential of the 
industry sector, for example by overlooking mitigation from material 
efficiency and circular economies (Sharmina et al. 2020), which can 
have substantial mitigation potential (Sections 5.3.4 and 11.3).
Sectoral studies indicate a large mitigation potential in the industrial 
sector by 2050, including the potential for net zero CO 2 emissions 
for steel, plastics, ammonia, and cement (Section  11.4.1). Detailed 
industry sector pathways show emissions reductions between 
39% and 94% by mid-century compared to the present day17 
(Section  11.4.2) and a  substantial increase in direct electrification 
(IEA 2021a). IAMs show comparable mitigation potential to sectoral 


and below and a maximum reduction of 96% (Figure 3.26). Some 
differences between IAMs and sectoral models can be attributed to 
differences in technology availability, with IAMs sometimes including 
more technologies (van Ruijven et al. 2016) and sometimes less 
(Sharmina et al. 2020).
3.4.6 Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU)
Mitigation pathways show substantial reductions in CO 2 emissions, 
but more modest reductions in AFOLU CH 4 and N 2O emissions 
(high confidence) (Popp et al. 2017; Roe et al. 2019; Reisinger et al. 
2021) (Figure  3.27). Pathways limiting warming to likely 2°C or 
lower are projected to reach net zero CO 2 emissions in the AFOLU 
sector around 2033 (2024–2060); however, AFOLU CH 4 and N 2O 
emissions remain positive in all pathways (Figure  3.27). While 
IAMs include many land-based mitigation options, these models 
exclude several options with large mitigation potential, such as 
biochar, agroforestry, restoration/avoided conversion of coastal 
wetlands, and restoration/avoided conversion of peatland (IPCC 
2019a; Smith et al. 2019) (Chapter  7 and Section  3.4). Sectoral 
studies show higher mitigation potential than IAM pathways, as

these studies include more mitigation options than IAMs (medium 
confidence) (Chapter 7).
Limiting warming to likely 2°C (>67%) or lower can result in 
large-scale transformation of the land surface (high confidence) 
(Popp et al. 2017; Rogelj et al. 2018a,b; Brown et al. 2019; Roe 
et al. 2019). The scale of land transformation depends, inter alia, 
on the temperature goal and the mitigation options included (Popp 
et al. 2017; Rogelj et al. 2018a; IPCC 2019a). Pathways with more 
demand-side mitigation options show less land transformation 
than those with more limited options (Grubler et al. 2018; van 
Vuuren et al. 2018; IPCC 2019a). Most of these pathways show 
increases in forest cover, with an increase of 322 million ha   
(–67 to 890 million ha) in 2050 in pathways that limit warming 
to  1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot, whereas bottom-
up models portray an economic potential of 300–500 million ha of 
additional forest (Chapter 7). Many IAM pathways also include large 
amounts of energy cropland area, to supply biomass for bioenergy and 
BECCS, with 199 (56–482) million ha in 2050 in pathways that limit 
warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot. Large land 
transformations, such as afforestation/reforestation and widespread 
planting of energy crops, can have implications for biodiversity and 
sustainable development (Sections 3.7, 7.7.4 and 12.5).
Delayed mitigation has implications for land-use transitions 
(Hasegawa et al. 2021a). Delaying mitigation action can result in 
a temporary overshoot of temperature and large-scale deployment 
of CDR in the second half of the century to reduce temperatures from their peak to a given level (Smith et al. 2019; Hasegawa et al. 2021a). 
IAM pathways rely on afforestation and BECCS as CDR measures, 
so delayed mitigation action results in substantial land-use change 
in the second half of the century with implications for sustainable 
development (Hasegawa et al. 2021a) (Section  3.7). Shifting to 
earlier mitigation action reduces the amount of land required for 
this, though at the cost of larger land-use transitions earlier in the 
century (Hasegawa et al. 2021a). Earlier action could also reduce 
climate impacts on agriculture and land-based mitigation options 
(Smith et al. 2019).
Some AFOLU mitigation options can enhance vegetation and 
soil carbon stocks such as reforestation, restoration of degraded 
ecosystems, protection of ecosystems with high carbon stocks and 
changes to agricultural land management to increase soil carbon 
(high confidence) (Griscom et al. 2017; de Coninck et al. 2018; Fuss 
et al. 2018; Smith et al. 2019) (AR6 WGIII Chapter 7). The time scales 
associated with these options indicate that carbon sinks in terrestrial 
vegetation and soil systems can be maintained or enhanced so as to 
contribute towards long-term mitigation (high confidence); however, 
many AFOLU mitigation options do not continue to sequester 
carbon indefinitely (Fuss et al. 2018; de Coninck et al. 2018; IPCC 
2019a) (AR6 WGIII Chapter  7). In the very long term (the latter 
part of the century and beyond), it will become more challenging 
to continue to enhance vegetation and soil carbon stocks, so that 
the associated carbon sinks could diminish or even become sources 
(high confidence) (de  Coninck et al. 2018; IPCC 2019a) (AR6 WGI 
Chapter 5). Sustainable forest management, including harvest and –50005001000Change in land from 2019 (million ha)

forest regeneration, can help to remediate and slow any decline in the 
forest carbon sink, for example by restoring degraded forest areas, 
and so go some way towards addressing the issue of sink saturation 
(IPCC 2019) (AR6 WGI Chapter 5; and Chapter 7 in this report). The 
accumulated carbon resulting from mitigation options that enhance 
carbon sequestration (e.g., reforestation, soil carbon sequestration) is 
also at risk of future loss due to disturbances (e.g., fire, pests) (Boysen 
et al. 2017; de Coninck et al. 2018; Fuss et al. 2018; Smith et al. 2019; 
IPCC 2019a;  Anderegg et al. 2020) (AR6 WGI Chapter 5). Maintaining 
the resultant high vegetation and soil carbon stocks could limit future 
land-use options, as maintaining these carbon stocks would require 
retaining the land use and land-cover configuration implemented to 
achieve the increased stocks.
Anthropogenic land CO 2 emissions and removals in IAM pathways 
cannot be directly compared with those reported in national 
GHG inventories (high confidence)  (Grassi et al. 2018, 2021) 
(Section  7.2).   Due to differences in  definitions  for the area  of 
managed forests and which emissions and removals are considered 
anthropogenic, the reported anthropogenic land CO 2  emissions 
and removals differ by about  5.5 GtCO 2  yr–1 between IAMs, 
which rely on bookkeeping approaches  (e.g.,  Houghton and 
Nassikas 2017), and national GHG inventories (Grassi et al. 
2021). Such  differences  in  definitions  can alter the  reported  time 
at which  anthropogenic  net zero  CO 2 emissions  are  reached  for 
a  given emission scenario. Using national inventories would lead 
to an earlier reported time of net zero (van Soest et al. 2021b) or 
to lower calculated cumulative emissions until the time of net zero 
(Grassi et al. 2021) as compared to IAM pathways. The numerical 
differences are purely due to differences in the conventions applied 
for reporting  the  anthropogenic  emissions and do not have any 
implications for the underlying land-use changes or mitigation 
measures in the pathways. Grassi et al. (Grassi et al. 2021) 
offer a  methodology for adjusting to reconcile these differences 
and enable a more accurate assessment of the collective progress 
achieved under the Paris Agreement (Chapter 7 and Cross-Chapter 
Box 6 in Chapter 7).
3.4.7 Other Carbon Dioxide Removal Options
This subsection includes other CDR options not discussed in the 
previous subsections, including direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), enhanced weathering (EW), and ocean-based approaches, 
focusing on the role of these options in long-term mitigation 
pathways, using both IAMs (Chen and Tavoni 2013; Marcucci 
et al. 2017; Rickels et al. 2018; Fuhrman et al. 2019, 2020, 2021; 
Realmonte et al. 2019; Akimoto et al. 2021; Strefler et al. 2021a) and 
non-IAMs (Fuss et al. 2013; González and Ilyina 2016; Bednar et al. 
2021; Shayegh et al. 2021). There are other options discussed in the 
literature, such as methane capture (Jackson et al. 2019), however, 
the role of these options in long-term mitigation pathways has not 
been quantified and is thus excluded here. Chapter 12 includes a more 
detailed description of the individual technologies, including their 
costs, potentials, financing, risks, impacts, maturity and upscaling.
Very few studies and pathways include other CDR options (Table 3.5). 
Pathways with DACCS include potentially large removal from DACCS 
(up to 37 GtCO 2 yr–1 in 2100) in the second half of the century 
(Chen and Tavoni 2013; Marcucci et al. 2017; Realmonte et al. 2019; 
Fuhrman et al. 2020, 2021; Shayegh et al. 2021; Akimoto et al. 2021) 
and reduced cost of mitigation (Bistline and Blanford 2021; Strefler 
et al. 2021a). At large scales, the use of DACCS has substantial 
implications for energy use, emissions, land, and water; substituting 
DACCS for BECCS results in increased energy usage, but reduced 
land-use change and water withdrawals (Fuhrman et al., 2020, 
2021) (Chapter 12.3.2; AR6 WGI Chapter 5). The level of deployment 
of DACCS is sensitive to the rate at which it can be scaled up, the 
climate goal or carbon budget, the underlying socio-economic 
scenario, the availability of other decarbonisation options, the cost 
of DACCS and other mitigation options, and the strength of carbon-
cycle feedbacks (Chen and Tavoni 2013; Fuss et al. 2013; Honegger 
and Reiner 2018; Realmonte et al. 2019; Fuhrman et al. 2020; Bistline 
and Blanford 2021; Fuhrman et al. 2021; Strefler et al. 2021a) (AR6 
WGI Chapter  5). Since DACCS consumes energy, its effectiveness 
depends on the type of energy used; the use of fossil fuels would 
reduce its sequestration efficiency (Creutzig et al. 2019; NASEM 2019; 
Babacan et al. 2020). Studies with additional CDR options in addition 
to DACCS (e.g., enhanced weathering, BECCS, afforestation, biochar, 
and soil carbon sequestration) find that CO 2 removal is spread across 
available options (Holz et al. 2018; Strefler et al. 2021a). Similar to 
DACCS, the deployment of deep-ocean storage depends on cost and 
the strength of carbon-cycle feedbacks (Rickels et al. 2018).Table 3.5 | Carbon dioxide removal in assessed pathways.  Scenarios are grouped by temperature categories, as defined in Section 3.2.4. Quantity indicates the median

3.5 Interaction Between Near-, Medium- and 
Long-term Action in Mitigation Pathways
This section assesses the relationship between long-term climate 
goals and short- to medium-term emissions reduction strategies 
based on the mitigation pathway literature. After an overview of 
this relationship (Section 3.5.1), it provides an assessment of what 
currently planned near-term action implies for limiting warming 
to  1.5°C–2°C (Section  3.5.2), and to what extent pathways with 
accelerated action beyond current NDCs can improve the ability to 
keep long-term targets in reach (Section 3.5.3).
The assessment in this section shows that if mitigation ambitions 
in NDCs announced prior to COP262,18 are followed until 2030, 
leading to estimated emissions of 47–57 GtCO 2-eq in 203019 
(Section  4.2.2), it is no longer possible to limit warming to  1.5°C 
(>50%) with no or limited overshoot (high confidence). Instead, it 
would entail high overshoot (typically >0.1°C) and reliance on net 
negative CO 2 emissions with uncertain potential to return warming 
to 1.5°C (>50%) by the end of the century. It would also strongly 
increase mitigation challenges to limit warming to 2°C (>67%) 
(high confidence). GHG emissions reductions would need to abruptly 
increase after 2030 to an annual average rate of  1.4–2.0 GtCO 2-
eq during the period 2030–2050, around 70% higher than in 
mitigation pathways assuming immediate action1 to limit warming 
to 2°C (>67%). The higher post-2030 reduction rates would have 
to be obtained in an environment of continued buildup of fossil fuel 
infrastructure and less development of low-carbon alternatives until 
2030. A  lock-in to fossil fuel-intensive production systems (carbon 
lock-in) will increase the societal, economic and political strain of 
a rapid low-carbon transition after 2030 (high confidence).
The section builds on previous assessments in the IPCC’s Fifth 
Assessment Report (Clarke et al. 2014) and the IPCC Special Report 
on 1.5°C Warming (Rogelj et al. 2018a). The literature assessed in these 
two reports has focused on delayed action until 2030 in the context of 
limiting warming to 2°C (den Elzen et al. 2010; van Vuuren and Riahi 
2011; Luderer et al. 2013, 2016; Rogelj et al. 2013a; Kriegler et al. 2015; 
Riahi et al. 2015) and 1.5°C (Rogelj et al. 2013b; Luderer et al. 2018; 
Strefler et al. 2018). Here we provide an update of these assessments 
drawing on the most recent literature on global mitigation pathways. 
New studies have focused, inter alia, on  constraining near-term 
developments by peak warming limits (Rogelj et al. 2019b; Riahi et al. 
2021; Strefler et al. 2021b) and updating assumptions about near- and  
medium-term emissions developments based on national plans 
and long-term strategies (Roelfsema et al. 2020) (Section 4.2). Several 
studies have explored new types of pathways with accelerated action 
bridging between current policy plans and the goal of limiting warming 
below 2°C (Kriegler et al. 2018a; van Soest et al. 2021a) and looked at 
hybrid international policy regimes to phase in global collective action 
(Bauer et al. 2020).


cases of implementing only the unconditional elements of NDCs announced prior to COP26 (50–57 GtCO 2-eq) and implementing both unconditional and conditional 
elements of NDCs announced prior to COP26 (47–55 GtCO 2-eq), if not specified otherwise.3.5.1 Relationship Between Long-term Climate Goals 
and Near- to Medium-term Emissions Reductions
The close link between cumulative CO 2 emissions and warming has 
strong implications for the relationship between near-, medium-, 
and long-term climate action to limit global warming. The AR6 
WGI Assessment has estimated a  remaining carbon budget of 

below  1.5°C with 50% (67%) likelihood, subject to additional 
uncertainties about historic warming and the climate response, 
and variations in warming from non-CO 2 climate forcers (Canadell and 
Monteiro 2019) (AR6 WGI Chapter 5, Section 5.5). For comparison, if 
current CO 2 emissions of more than 40 GtCO 2 are keeping up until 
2030, more than 400 GtCO 2 will be emitted during 2021–2030, 
already exhausting the remaining carbon budget for 1.5°C by 2030.
The relationship between warming limits and near-term action is 
illustrated in Figure 3.29, using a set of 1.5°C–2°C scenarios with 
different levels of near-term action, overshoot and non-CO 2 warming 
contribution from a recent study (Riahi et al. 2021). In general, the 
more CO 2 is emitted until 2030, the less CO 2 can be emitted thereafter 
to stay within a remaining carbon budget and below a warming limit. 
Scenarios with immediate action to observe the warming limit give 
the longest time to exhaust the associated remaining carbon budget 
and reach net zero CO 2 emissions (see light blue lines in Figure 3.29 
and Cross-Chapter Box 3 in this chapter). In comparison, following 
projected NDC emissions until 2030 would imply a more pronounced 
drop in emissions from 2030 levels to net zero to make up for the 
additional near-term emissions (see orange lines in Figure  3.29). 
If  such a  drop does not occur, the remaining carbon budget is 
exceeded and net negative CO 2 emissions are required to return 
global mean temperature below the warming limit (see black lines in 
Figure 3.29) (Clarke et al. 2014; Fuss et al. 2014; Rogelj et al. 2018a).
The relationship between warming limits and near-term action is 
also affected by the warming contribution of non-CO 2 greenhouse 
gases and other short-lived climate forcers (Section  3.3; AR6 WGI 
Section  6.7). The estimated budget values for limiting warming 
to  1.5°C–2°C already assume stringent reductions in non-CO 2 
greenhouse gases and non-CO 2 climate forcing as found in 1.5°C–2°C 
pathways (Section 3.3 and Cross-Working Group Box 1 in this chapter; 
AR6 WGI Section  5.5 and Box  5.2 in Chapter  5). Further variations 
in non-CO 2 warming observed across  1.5°C–2°C pathways can vary 
the median estimate for the remaining carbon budget by 220 GtCO 2 
(AR6 WGI Section 5.5). In 1.5°C–2°C pathways, the non-CO 2 warming 
contribution differs strongly between the near, medium and long term. 
Changes to the atmospheric composition of short-lived climate forcers 
(SLCFs) dominate the warming response in the near term (AR6 WGI 
Section 6.7). CO 2 reductions are combined with strong reductions in air 
pollutant emissions due to rapid reduction in fossil fuel combustion and 
in some cases the assumption of stringent air quality policies (Rao et al. 
2017b; Smith et al. 2020c). As air pollutants exert a net-cooling effect, 
their reduction drives up non-CO 2 warming in the near term, which 
can be attenuated by the simultaneous reduction of methane and 
black carbon (Shindell and Smith 2019; Smith et al. 2020b) (AR6 WGI 
Section 6.7). After 2030, the reduction in methane concentrations and 
associated reductions in tropospheric ozone levels tend to dominate 
so that a peak and decline in non-CO 2 forcing and non-CO 2-induced 
warming can occur before net zero CO 2 is reached (Figure 3.29) (Rogelj 
et al. 2018a). The more stringent the reductions in methane and other 
short-lived warming agents such as black carbon, the lower this peak 
and the earlier the decline of non-CO 2 warming, leading to a reduction 
of warming rates and overall warming in the near to medium term 
(Harmsen et al. 2020; Smith et al. 2020b). This is important for keeping 
warming below a tight warming limit that is already reached around 
mid-century as is the case in  1.5°C pathways (Xu and Ramanathan 2017). Early and deep reductions of methane emissions, and other 
short-lived warming agents such as black carbon, provide space for 
residual CO 2-induced warming until the point of net zero CO 2 emissions 
is reached (see purple lines in Figure 3.29). Such emissions reductions 
have also been advocated due to co-benefits for, for example, reducing 
air pollution (Rao et al. 2016; Shindell et al. 2017a, 2018; Shindell and 
Smith 2019; Rauner et al. 2020a; Vandyck et al. 2020).
The relationship between long-term climate goals and near-term 
action is further constrained by social, technological, economic and 
political factors (Cherp et al. 2018; van Sluisveld et al. 2018b; Aghion 
et al. 2019; Mercure et al. 2019; Trutnevyte et al. 2019b; Jewell and 
Cherp 2020). These factors influence path dependency and transition 
speed (Pahle et al. 2018; Vogt-Schilb et al. 2018). While detailed 2000 2020 2040 2060 2080 2100-20-1001020304050[GtCO2 yr–1]

(c) effective non-CO 2 radiative forcing, and (d) the resulting estimate of the 67th percentile of global mean temperature response relative to 1850–1900. Light blue lines 
show a scenario that acts immediately on a remaining carbon budget of 900 GtCO 2 from 2020 without allowing net negative CO 2 emissions (i.e., temporary budget overshoot) 
(COFFEE 1.1, Scenario EN_NPi2020_900). Orange and black lines show scenarios drawn from the same model that follow the NDCs until 2030 and thereafter introduce action 
to stay within the same budget – in one case excluding net negative CO 2 emissions like before (orange lines; COFFEE 1.1., Scenario EN-INDCi2030_900) and in the other 
allowing for a temporary overshoot of the carbon budget until 2100 (black lines; COFFEE 1.1., Scenario EN-INDCi2030_900f). Light blue lines describe a scenario following the 
NDCs until 2030, and then aiming for a higher budget of 2300 GtCO 2 without overshoot (AIM/CGE 2.2, Scenario EN-INDCi2030_1200). It is drawn from another model which 
projects a lower anthropogenic non-CO 2 forcing contribution and therefore achieves about the same temperature outcome as the other two non-overshoot scenarios despite 
the higher CO 2 budget. Grey funnels include the trajectories from all scenarios that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) (category C3). Historical CO 2 emissions until 2019 are from

integrated assessment modelling of global mitigation pathways 
accounts for technology inertia (Bertram et al. 2015a; Mercure et al. 
2018) and technology innovation and diffusion (Wilson et al. 2013; 
van Sluisveld et al. 2018a; Luderer et al. 2021), there are limitations 
in capturing socio-technical and political drivers of innovation, 
diffusion and transition processes (Gambhir et al. 2019; Köhler et al. 
2019; Hirt et al. 2020; Keppo et al. 2021). Mitigation pathways show 
a  wide range of transition speeds that have been interrogated in 
the context of socio-technical inertia (Gambhir et al. 2017; Kefford 
et al. 2018; Kriegler et al. 2018a; Brutschin et al. 2021) vs accelerating 
technological change and self-enforcing socio-economic developments 
(Creutzig et al. 2017; Zenghelis 2019) (Section 3.8). Diagnostic analysis 
of detailed IAMs found a lag of 8–20 years between the convergence 
of emissions pricing and the convergence of emissions response after 
a period of differentiated emission prices (Harmsen et al. 2021). This 
provides a  measure of the inertia to changing policy signals in the 
model response. It is about half the time scale of 20–40 years observed 
for major energy transitions (Grubb et al. 2021). Hence, the mitigation 
pathways assessed here capture socio-technical inertia in reducing 
emissions, but the limited modelling of socio-political factors may alter 
the extent and persistence of this inertia.
3.5.2 Implications of Near-term Emission Levels for 
Keeping Long-term Climate Goals Within Reach
The implications of near-term climate action for long-term climate 
outcomes can be explored by comparing mitigation pathways with 
different near-term emissions developments aiming for the same 
climate target (Riahi et al. 2015; Vrontisi et al. 2018; Roelfsema 
et al. 2020). A particular example is the comparison of cost-effective 
pathways with immediate action to limit warming to 1.5°C–2°C with 
mitigation pathways pursuing more moderate mitigation action 
until 2030. After the adoption of the Paris Agreement, near-term 
action was often modelled to reflect conditional and unconditional 
elements of originally submitted NDCs (2015–2019) (Fawcett et al. 
2015; Fujimori et al. 2016a; Kriegler et al. 2018a; Vrontisi et al. 
2018; Roelfsema et al. 2020). The most recent modelling studies 
also include submission of updated NDCs or announcements of 
planned updates in the first half of 2021 (Network for Greening 
the Financial System 2021; Riahi et al. 2021). Emissions levels 
under NDCs announced prior to COP26 are assessed to range 
between 47–57 GtCO 2-eq in 2030 (Section  4.2.2). This assessed 
range corresponds well to 2030 emissions levels in 2°C mitigation 
pathways in the literature that are designed to follow the original 
or updated NDCs until 2030.20 For the 139 scenarios of this kind 
that are collected in the AR6 scenario database and that still 
limit warming to 2°C (>67%), the 2030 emissions range is 53 
(45–58) GtCO 2-eq (based on native model reporting) and 52.5 
(47–56.5) GtCO 2-eq, respectively (based on harmonised emissions 
data for climate assessment (Annex III.2.5.1); median and 5–95th 
percentile). This close match allows a  robust assessment of the 
implications of implementing NDCs announced prior to COP26 for 

of this assessment to establish a categorisation of policy assumptions underpinning the mitigation pathways collected in the AR6 scenario database (Section 3.2 and 
Annex III.II.3.2.2).post-2030 mitigation efforts and warming outcomes based on the 
literature and the AR6 scenarios database. 
Without a  strengthening of policies beyond those that are 
implemented by the end of 2020, GHG emissions are projected 
to rise beyond 2025, leading to a median global warming of 3.2 
[2.2 to  3.5] °C by 2100. Modelled pathways that are consistent 
with NDCs announced prior to COP26 until 2030 and assume no 
increase in ambition thereafter have lower emissions, leading to 
a median global warming of 2.8°C [2.1–3.4°C] by 2100.
The assessed emission ranges from implementing the unconditional 
(unconditional and conditional) elements of NDCs announced prior to 
COP26 implies an emissions gap to cost-effective mitigation pathways 
of 19–26 (16–23) GtCO 2-eq in 2030 for limiting warming to 1.5°C 
(>50%) with no or limited overshoot and 10–16 (6–14) GtCO 2-eq in 

Chapter 4). The emissions gap gives rise to a number of mitigation 
challenges (Kriegler et al. 2013a, 2018a,b; Luderer et al. 2013, 2018; 
Rogelj et al. 2013a; Fawcett et al. 2015; Riahi et al. 2015; Fujimori 
et al. 2016b; Strefler et al. 2018; Winning et al. 2019; SEI et al. 2020; 
UNEP 2020): (i) larger transitional challenges post-2030 to still 
remain under the warming limit, in particular higher CO 2 emissions 
reduction rates and technology transition rates required during 
2030–2050; (ii)  larger lock-in into carbon-intensive infrastructure 
and increased risk of stranded fossil fuel assets (Section  3.5.2.2); 
and (iii) larger reliance on CDR to reach net zero CO 2 more rapidly 
and compensate excess emissions in the second half of the century 
(Section  3.5.2.1). All these factors exacerbate the socio-economic 
strain of implementing the transition, leading to an increased risk 
of overshooting the warming and a  higher risk of climate change 
impacts (Drouet et al. 2021).
The challenges are illustrated in Table 3.6 and Figure 3.30, surveying 
global mitigation pathways in the literature that were collected in 
the AR6 scenarios database. There is a clear trend of increasing peak 
warming with increasing 2030 GHG emission levels (Figure 3.30a,b). 
In particular, there is no mitigation pathway designed to follow the 
NDCs until 2030 that can limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or 
limited overshoot. Our assessment confirms the finding of the IPCC  
Special Report on Global Warming of  1.5°C (Rogelj et al. 2018) for 
the case of NDCs announced prior to COP26 that pathways following 
the NDCs until 2030 ‘would not limit global warming to 1.5°C, even if 
supplemented by very challenging increases in the scale and ambition 
of emissions reductions after 2030’ (SR1.5 SPM). This assessment is now 
more robust than in SR1.5 as it is based on a larger set of 1.5°C–2°C 
pathways with better representation of current trends and plans 
covering a  wider range of post-2030 emissions developments. In 
particular, a  recent multi-model study limiting peak cumulative CO 2 
emissions for a wide range of carbon budgets and immediate vs NDC-
type action until 2030 established a feasibility frontier for the existence 
of such pathways across participating models (Riahi et al. 2021).

The 2030 emissions levels in the NDCS announced prior to COP26 
also tighten the remaining space to limit warming to 2°C (>67%). As 
shown in Figure 3.30b, the 67th percentile of peak warming reaches 
values above 1.7°C in pathways with 2030 emissions levels in this 
range. To still limit warming to 2°C (>67%), the global post-2030 GHG 
emission reduction rates would need to be abruptly raised in 2030 
from 0–0.7 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 to an average of 1.4–2.0 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 
during the period 2030–2050 (Figure  3.30c), around 70% higher 
than in immediate mitigation pathways confirming findings in 
the literature (Winning et al. 2019). Their average reduction rate 
of 0.6–1.4 GtCO 2 yr–1 would already be unprecedented at the global 
scale and, with a  few exceptions, national scale for an extended 
period of time (Riahi et al. 2015). For comparison, the impact of 
COVID-19 on the global economy is projected to have lead to 
a decline of around 2.5–3 GtCO 2 of global CO 2 emissions from fossil 
fuels and industry in 2020 (Friedlingstein et al. 2020) (Section 2.2).
The increased post-2030 transition challenge in mitigation pathways 
with moderate near-term action is also reflected in the timing of 
reaching net zero CO 2 emissions (Figure  3.30d and Cross-Chapter 
Box 3 in this chapter). As 2030 emission levels and the cumulated 
CO2 emissions until 2030 increase, the remaining time for dropping 
to net zero CO 2 and staying within the remaining carbon budget 
shortens (Figure  3.29). This gives rise to an inverted  v-shape of 
the lower bound on the year of reaching net zero as a function of 

reaching net zero early (left leg of the inverted v), but staying high 
until 2030 also requires reaching net zero CO 2 faster to compensate 
for higher emissions early on (right leg of the inverted v). Overall, 
there is a considerable spread of the timing of net zero CO 2 for any 

remaining carbon budget and the non-CO 2 warming contribution 
(Cross-Chapter Box 3 in this chapter).
There is also a  profound impact on the underlying transition of 
energy and land use (Figure  3.30f–h and Table  3.6). Scenarios 
following NDCs until 2030 show a much smaller reduction in fossil 
fuel use, a slower growth in renewable energy use, and a  smaller 
reduction in CO 2 and CH 4 land-use emissions in 2030 compared to 
immediate action scenarios. This is then followed by a much faster 
reduction of land-use emissions and fossil fuels, and a larger increase 
of nuclear energy, bioenergy and non-biomass renewable energy 
during the medium term in order to get close to the levels of the 
immediate action pathways in 2050. This is combined with a larger 
amount of net negative CO 2 emissions that are used to compensate 
the additional emissions before 2030. The faster transition during 
2030–2050 is taking place from a greater investment in fossil fuel 
infrastructure and lower deployment of low-carbon alternatives in 
2030, adding to the socio-economic challenges to realise the higher 
transition rates (Section 3.5.2.2). Therefore, these pathways also show 
higher mitigation costs, particularly during the period 2030–2050, 
than immediate action scenarios (Section  3.6.1 and Figure  3.34d) 
(Liu et al. 2016; Kriegler et al. 2018a; Vrontisi et al. 2018). Given 
these circumstances and the fact the modelling of socio-political and 
institutional constraints is limited in Integrated Assessment Models 
(IAMs) (Gambhir et al. 2019; Köhler et al. 2019; Hirt et al. 2020; Keppo 
et al. 2021), the feasibility of realising these scenarios is assessed to be lower (Gambhir et al. 2017; Napp et al. 2017; Brutschin et al. 2021) 
(cf. Section 3.8), increasing the risk of an overshoot of climate goals.
3.5.2.1 Overshoot and Net Negative CO 2 Emissions
If near- to medium-term emissions developments deplete the 
remaining carbon budget, the associated warming limit will be 
overshot. Some pathways that return warming to 1.5°C (>50%) by 
the end of the century show mid-century overshoots of up to 1.8°C 
median warming. The overshoot tends to be higher, the higher the 

the NDCS announced prior to COP26 consistently overshoot 1.5°C 
by  0.15°C–0.3°C. This leads to higher risks from climate change 
impacts during the time of overshoot compared to pathways that limit 
warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot (Schleussner 
et al. 2016a; Mengel et al. 2018; Hofmann et al. 2019; Lenton et al. 
2019; Tachiiri et al. 2019;  Drouet et al. 2021). Furthermore, even if 
warming is reversed by net negative emissions, other climate changes 
such as sea level rise would continue in their current direction for 
decades to millennia (AR6 WGI Sections 4.6 and 5.6).
Returning warming to lower levels requires net negative CO 2 
emissions in the second half of the century (Clarke et al. 2014; 
Fuss et al. 2014; Rogelj et al. 2018a). The amount of net negative 
CO2 emissions in pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C–2°C climate 
goals varies widely, with some pathways not deploying net negative 
CO2 emissions at all and others deploying up to –600 to –800 GtCO 2. 
The amount of net negative CO 2 emissions tends to increase with 

the ability of net negative CO 2 emissions to reduce warming, but 
pointed to path dependencies in the storage of carbon and heat 
in the Earth System and the need for further research particularly 
for cases of high overshoot (Zickfeld et al. 2016, 2021; Keller et al. 
2018a,b; Tokarska et al. 2019). The AR6 WGI assessed the reduction 
in global surface temperature to be approximately linearly related to 
cumulative CO 2 removal and, with lower confidence, that the amount 
of cooling per unit CO 2 removed is approximately independent of the 
rate and amount of removal (AR6 WGI TS.3.3.2). Still there remains 
large uncertainty about a potential asymmetry between the warming 
response to CO 2 emissions and the cooling response to net negative 
CO2 emissions (Zickfeld et al. 2021). It was also shown that warming 
can adversely affect the efficacy of carbon dioxide removal measures 
and hence the ability to achieve net negative CO 2 emissions 
(Boysen et al. 2016).
Obtaining net negative CO 2 emissions requires massive deployment 
of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) in the second half of the century, on 
the order of 220 (160–370) GtCO 2 for each 0.1°C degree of cooling 
(based on the assessment of the likely range of the transient response 
to cumulative CO 2 emissions in AR6 WGI Section 5.5 in Chapter 5, 
not taking into account potential asymmetries in the temperature 
response to CO 2 emissions and removals). CDR is assessed in detail 
in Section  12.3 of this report (see also Cross-Chapter Box  8 in 
Chapter 12). Here we only point to the finding that CDR ramp-up 
rates and absolute deployment levels are tightly limited by techno-
economic, social, political, institutional and sustainability constraints 
(Smith et al. 2016; Boysen et al. 2017; Fuss et al. 2018, 2020; Nemet 
et al. 2018; Hilaire et al. 2019; Jia et al. 2019) (Section 12.3). CDR 
therefore cannot be deployed arbitrarily to compensate any degree 
of overshoot. A fraction of models was not able to compute pathways 
that would follow the mitigation ambition in unconditional and 
conditional NDCs until 2030 and return warming to below 1.5°C by 

There exists a  three-way trade-off between near-term emissions 
developments until 2030, transitional challenges during 2030–50, 
and long-term CDR deployment post-2050 (Sanderson et al. 2016; 
Holz et al. 2018; Strefler et al. 2018). For example, Strefler et al. (2018) 
find that if CO 2 emission levels stay at around 40 GtCO 2 until 2030, 
within the range of what is projected for NDCs announced prior 
to COP26, rather than being halved to 20 GtCO 2 until 2030, CDR 
deployment in the second half of the century would have to increase 
by 50–100%, depending on whether the 2030–2050 CO 2 emissions 
reduction rate is doubled from 6% to 12% or kept at 6% yr–1. This 
three-way trade-off has also been identified at the national level 
(Pan et al. 2020).
In addition to enabling a  temporary budget overshoot by net 
negative CO 2 emissions in the second half of the century, CDR can 
also be used to compensate  – on an annual basis  – residual CO 2 
emissions from sources that are difficult to eliminate and to reach 
net zero CO 2 emissions more rapidly if deployed before this point 
(Kriegler et al. 2013b; Rogelj et al. 2018a). This explains its continued 
deployment in pathways that exclude overshoot and net negative 
CO2 emissions (Riahi et al. 2021). However, given the time scales that 
would likely be needed to ramp-up CDR to gigatonne scale (Nemet 
et al. 2018), it can be expected to only make a limited contribution to 
reaching net zero CO 2 as fast as possible. In the vast majority (95%) 
of 1.5°C–2°C mitigation pathways assessed in this report, cumulative 
CDR deployment did not exceed 100 GtCO 2 until mid-century. This 
adds to the risk of excessively relying on CDR to compensate for 
weak mitigation action until 2030 by either facilitating massive 
net CO 2 emissions reduction rates during 2030–2050 or allowing 
a high temporary overshoot of 1.5°C until the end of the century. If 
international burden-sharing considerations are taken into account, 
the CDR penalty for weak action could increase further, in particular 
for developed countries (Fyson et al. 2020). Further assessment 
of CDR deployment in  1.5°C–2°C mitigation pathways is found 
in Section 3.4.7.
3.5.2.2 Carbon Lock-in and Stranded Assets
There already exists a substantial and growing carbon lock-in today, 
as measured by committed emissions associated with existing long-
lived infrastructure (Section  2.7 and Figure  2.31). If existing fossil 
fuel infrastructure would continue to be operated as historically, it 
would entail CO 2 emissions exceeding the carbon budget for 1.5°C 
(Section  2.7.2 and Figure  2.32). However, owner-operators and 
societies may choose to retire existing infrastructure earlier than 
in the past, and committed emissions are thus contingent on the 
competitiveness of non-emitting alternative technologies and 
climate policy ambition. Therefore, in mitigation pathways, some 
infrastructure may become stranded assets. Stranded assets have 
been defined as ‘assets that have suffered from unanticipated or premature write-downs, devaluations or conversion to liabilities’ 
(Caldecott 2017).
A systematic map of the literature on carbon lock-in has synthesized 
quantification of stranded assets in the mitigation pathways 
literature, and showed that (i) coal power plants are the most 
exposed to risk of  becoming stranded, (ii) delayed mitigation 
action increases stranded assets, and (iii) sectoral distribution and 
the amount of  stranded assets differ between countries (Fisch-
Romito et al. 2021). There is high agreement that existing fossil fuel 
infrastructure would need to be retired earlier than historically, used 
less, or retrofitted with CCS, to stay within the remaining carbon 
budgets of limiting warming to 1.5°C or 2°C (Johnson et al. 2016; 
Kefford et al. 2018; Pfeiffer et al. 2018; Cui et al. 2019; Fofrich et al. 
2020; Rogelj et al. 2018a). Studies estimate that cumulative early 
retired power plant capacities by 2060 can be up to 600 GW for gas 
and 1700 GW for coal (Iyer et al. 2015a; Kefford et al. 2018), that 
only 42% of the total capital stock of both operating and planned 
coal-fired powers plants can be utilised to be compatible with the 
2°C target (Pfeiffer et al. 2018), and that coal-fired power plants in 
scenarios consistent with keeping global warming below 2°C or 1.5°C 
retire one to three decades earlier than historically has been the case 
(Cui et al. 2019; Fofrich et al. 2020). After coal, electricity production 
based on gas is also projected to be phased out, with some capacity 
remaining as back-up (van Soest et al. 2017a). Kefford et al. (2018) 
find USD541 billion worth of stranded fossil fuel power plants could 
be created by 2060, with China and India the most exposed.
Some publications have suggested that stranded long-lived assets 
may be even more important outside of the power sector. While 
stranded power sector assets by 2050 could reach up to USD1.8 trillion 
in scenarios consistent with a 2°C target, Saygin et al. (2019) found 
a range of USD5–11 trillion in the buildings sector. Muldoon-Smith 
and Greenhalgh (2019) have even estimated a potential value at risk 
for global real estate assets up to USD21 trillion. More broadly, the set 
of economic activities that are potentially affected by a low-carbon 
transition is wide and includes also energy-intensive industries, 
transport and housing, as reflected in the concept of climate policy 
relevant sectors introduced in Battiston et al. (2017). The sectoral 
distribution and amount of stranded assets differ across countries 
(Fisch-Romito et al. 2021). Capital for fossil fuel production and 
distribution represents a larger share of potentially stranded assets in 
fossil fuel-producing countries such as the United States and Russia. 
Electricity generation would be a larger share of total stranded assets 
in emerging countries because this capital is relatively new compared 
to its operational lifetime. Conversely, buildings could represent 
a  larger part of stranded capital in more developed countries and 
regions such as the USA, EU or even Russia because of high market 
value and low turnover rate.
Many quantitative estimates of stranded assets along mitigation 
pathways have focused on fossil fuel power plants in pathways 
characterised by mitigation ambition until 2030 corresponding to the 
NDCs followed by strengthened action afterwards to limit warming 
to 2°C (>67%) or lower (Bertram et al. 2015a; Iyer et al. 2015b; 
Lane  et al. 2016; Farfan and Breyer 2017; van Soest et al. 2017a; 
Kriegler et al. 2018a; Luderer et al. 2018; Cui et al. 2019; Saygin et al. 
2019; SEI et al. 2020). Pathways following NDCs announced prior 
to COP26 until 2030 do not show a significant reduction of coal, oil 
and gas use (Figure 3.30f–h and Table 3.6) compared to immediate 
action pathways. Stranded coal power assets are evaluated to be 
higher by a factor of two to three if action is strengthened after 2030 
rather than now (Iyer et al. 2015b; Cui et al. 2019). There is high 
agreement that the later climate policies are implemented, the higher 
the expected stranded assets and the societal, economic and political 
strain of strengthening action. Associated price increases for carbon-
intensive goods and transitional macro-economic costs have been 
found to scale with the emissions gap in 2030 (Kriegler et al. 2013a). 
At the aggregate level of the whole global economy, Rozenberg et al. 
(2015) showed that each year of delaying the start of mitigation 
decreases the required CO 2 intensity of new production by 20–50 
gCO 2 per USD. Carbon lock-in can have a long-lasting effect on future 
emissions trajectories after 2030. Luderer et al. (2018) compared 
cost-effective pathways with immediate action to limit warming 
to  1.5°C–2°C with pathways following the NDCs until 2030 and 
adopting the pricing policy of the cost-effective pathways thereafter, 
and found that the majority of additional CO 2 emissions from carbon 
lock-in occur after 2030, reaching a cumulative amount of 290 (160–
330) GtCO 2 by 2100 (Section 2.7.2). Early action and avoidance of 
investments in new carbon-intensive assets can minimise these risks.
The risk of stranded assets has implications for workers depending 
on those assets, asset owners, assets portfolio managers, financial 
institutions and the stability of the financial system. Chapter  6 
assesses the risks and implications of stranded assets for energy 
systems (Section 6.7.3 and Box 6.11) and fossil fuels (Section 6.7.4). 
The implications of stranded assets for inequality and Just Transition 
are assessed in Chapter 17 (Section 17.3.2.3). Chapter 15 assesses 
the literature on those implications for the financial system as well 
as on coping options (Sections 15.5.2 and 15.6.1).
On the other hand, mitigation, by limiting climate change, reduces 
the risk of destroyed or stranded assets from the physical impacts of 
climate change on natural and human systems, from more frequent, 
intense or extended extreme events and from sea level rise (O’Neill 
et al. 2020a). The literature on mitigation pathways rarely includes an 
evaluation of stranded assets from climate change impacts. Unruh 
(2019) suggest that these are the real stranded assets of carbon lock-
in and could prove much more costly.
3.5.3 Global Accelerated Action Towards Long-term 
Climate Goals
A growing literature explores long-term mitigation pathways with 
accelerated near-term action going beyond the NDCs (Graichen 
et al. 2017; Jiang et al. 2017; Kriegler et al. 2018a; Roelfsema et al. 
2018; Fekete et al. 2021; van Soest et al. 2021a). Global accelerated 
action pathways are designed to transition more gradually from 
implemented policies and planned implementation of NDCs onto 
a  1.5°C–2°C pathway and at the same time alleviate the abrupt 
transition in 2030 that would be caused by following the NDCs until 

(Section 3.5.2). Therefore, they have sometimes been called bridging scenarios/pathways in the literature (IEA 2011; Spencer et al. 
2015; van Soest et al. 2021a). They rely on regionally differentiated 
regulatory and pricing policies to gradually strengthening regional 
and sectoral action beyond the mitigation ambition in the NDCs. 
There are limitations to this approach. The tighter the warming 
limit, the more likely it is that disruptive action becomes inevitable 
to achieve the speed of transition that would be required (Kriegler 
et al. 2018a). Cost-effective pathways already have abrupt shifts in 
deployments, investments and prices at the time a stringent warming 
limit is imposed, reflecting the fact that the overall response to 
climate change has so far been misaligned with long-term climate 
goals (Fawcett et al. 2015; Rogelj et al. 2016; Schleussner et al. 2016b; 
Geiges et al. 2020). Disruptive action can help to break lock-ins and 
enable transformative change (Vogt-Schilb et al. 2018).
The large literature on accelerating climate action was assessed in 
the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of  1.5°C (de Coninck 
et al. 2018) and is taken up in this report primarily in Chapters 4, 13, 
and 14. Accelerating climate action and facilitating transformational 
change requires a perspective on socio-technical transitions (Geels 
et al. 2016a; Geels et al. 2016b; Geels 2020), a portfolio of policy 
instruments to manage technological and environmental change 
(Fischer and Newell 2008; Goulder and Parry 2008; Acemoglu et al. 
2012, 2016), a  notion of path dependency and policy sequencing 
(Pierson 2000; Meckling et al. 2017; Pahle et al. 2018) and the 
evolvement of polycentric governance layers of institutions and 
norms in support of the transformation (Dietz et al. 2003; Leach et al. 
2007; Messner 2015). This subsection is focused on an assessment 
of the emerging quantitative literature on global accelerated action 
pathways towards 1.5°C–2°C, which to a large extent abstracts from 
the underlying processes and uses a number of stylised approaches 
to generate these pathways. A representative of accelerated action 
pathways has been identified as one of the Illustrative Mitigation 
Pathways (IMPs) in this assessment (IMP-GS, Figure 3.31).
One approach relies on augmenting initially moderate emissions-
pricing policies with robust anticipation of ratcheting up climate 
action in the future (Spencer et al. 2015). If announcements of 
strong future climate policies are perceived to be credible, they 
can help to prevent carbon lock-in as investors anticipating high 
future costs of GHG emissions would reduce investment into fossil 
fuel infrastructure, such as coal power plants (Bauer et al. 2018b). 
However, the effectiveness of such announcements strongly 
hinges on their credibility. If investors believe that policymakers 
could drop them if anticipatory action did not occur, they may not 
undertake such action.
Another approach relies on international cooperation to strengthen 
near-term climate action. These studies build on international climate 
policy architectures that could incentivise a coalition of like-minded 
countries to raise their mitigation ambition beyond what is stated in 
their NDC (Graichen et al. 2017). Examples are the idea of climate 
clubs characterised by harmonised carbon and technology markets 
(Nordhaus 2015; Keohane et al. 2017; Paroussos et al. 2019; Pihl 
2020) and the Powering Past Coal Alliance (PPCA) (Jewell et al. 2019). 
Paroussos et al. (2019) find economic benefits of joining a climate 
club despite the associated higher mitigation effort, in particular due

Soest et al. (2021a) with only seven models reporting emissions and climate results and eight models reporting carbon prices. The purple dot denotes the Illustrative Mitigation

to access to technology and climate finance. Graichen et al. (2017) 
find an additional reduction of  5–11 GtCO 2-eq compared to the 
mitigation ambition in the NDCs from the successful implementation 
of international climate initiatives. Other studies assess benefits from 
international transfers of mitigation outcomes (Stua 2017; Edmonds 
et al. 2021). Edmonds et al. (2021) find economic gains from sharing 
NDC emissions-reduction commitments compared to purely domestic 
implementation of NDCs. If reinvested in mitigation efforts, the study 
projects an additional reduction of 9 billion tonnes of CO 2 in 2030.
The most common approach relies on strengthening regulatory policies 
beyond current policy trends, also motivated by the finding that such 
policies have so far been employed more often than comprehensive 
carbon pricing (Kriegler et al. 2018a; Roelfsema et al. 2018; Fekete et al. 
2021; IEA 2021a; van Soest et al. 2021a). Some studies have focused 
on generic regulatory policies such as low-carbon support policies, 
fossil fuel-sunset policies, and resource-efficiency policies (Bertram 
et al. 2015b; Hatfield-Dodds et al. 2017). Bertram et al. (2015b) found 
that a moderate carbon price combined with a coal moratorium and 
ambitious low-carbon support policies can limit efficiency losses until 

They also showed that all three components are needed to achieve this 
outcome. Hatfield-Dodds et al. (2017) found that resource efficiency 
can lower 2050 emissions by an additional 15–20% while boosting 
near-term economic growth. The International Energy Agency (IEA 
2021a) developed a detailed net zero scenario for the global energy 
sector characterised by a  rapid phase-out of fossil fuels, a  massive 
clean energy and electrification push, and the stabilisation of energy 
demand, leading to 10 GtCO 2 lower emissions from energy use in 2030 
than in a scenario following the announced pledges.
The Paris Agreement has spurred the formulation of NDCs for 2030 
and mid-century strategies around the world (cf. Chapter 4). This is 
giving researchers a  rich empirical basis to formulate accelerated 
policy packages taking national decarbonisation pathways as 
a starting point (Graichen et al. 2017; Jiang et al. 2017; van Soest 
et al. 2017b; Waisman et al. 2019). The concept is to identify good 
practice policies that had demonstrable impact on pushing low-
carbon options or reducing emissions in a  country or region and 
then consider a wider roll out of these policies taking into account 
regional specificities (den Elzen et al. 2015; Fekete et al. 2015, 2021; 
Kriegler et al. 2018a; Kuramochi et al. 2018; Roelfsema et al. 2018). 
A challenge for this approach is to account for the fact that policy 
effectiveness varies with different political environments in different 
geographies. As a result, a global roll out of good practice policies to 
close the emissions gap will still be an idealised benchmark, but it is 
useful to understand how much could be gained from it.
Accelerated action pathways derived with this approach show 
considerable scope for narrowing the emissions gap between 
pathways reflecting the ambition level of the NDCs and cost-
effective mitigation pathways in 2030. Kriegler et al. (2018a) find 
around 10 GtCO 2-eq lower emissions compared to original NDCs 
from a global roll out of good practice plus net zero policies and 
a  moderate increase in regionally differentiated carbon pricing. 
Fekete et al. (2021) show that global replication of sector progress 
in five major economies would reduce GHG emissions in 2030 by about 20% compared to a  current policy scenario. These findings 
were found in good agreement with a  recent model comparison 
study based on results from nine integrated assessment models 
(IAMs) (van Soest et al. 2021a). Based on these three studies, 
implementing accelerated action in terms of a  global roll out of 
regulatory and moderate pricing policies is assessed to lead to 
global GHG emissions of 48 (38–52) GtCO 2-eq in 2030 (median 
and 5–95th percentile based on 10 distinct modelled pathways). This 
closes the implementation gap for the NDCs, and in addition falls 
below the emissions range implied by implementing unconditional 
and conditional elements of NDCs by  2–9 GtCO 2-eq. However, it 
does not close the emissions gap to immediate action pathways 
that limit warming to 2°C (>67%), and, based on our assessment in 
Section 3.5.2, emission levels above 40 GtCO 2-eq in 2030 still have 
a very low prospect for limiting warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no 
or limited overshoot.
Figure  3.31 shows the intermediate position of accelerated action 
pathways derived by van Soest et al. (2021a) between pathways 
that follow the NDCs until 2030 and immediate action pathways 
limiting warming to 2°C (>67%). Accelerated action is able to reduce 
the abrupt shifts in emissions, fossil fuel use and low-carbon power 
generation in 2030 and also limits peak warming more effectively 
than NDC pathways. But primarily due to the moderate carbon price 
assumptions (Figure 3.31b), the reductions in emissions and particular 
fossil fuel use are markedly smaller than what would be obtained in 
the case of immediate action. The assessment shows that accelerated 
action until 2030 can have significant benefits in terms of reducing the 
mitigation challenges from following the NDCs until 2030. But putting 
a significant value on GHG emissions reductions globally remains a key 
element of moving onto  1.5°C–2°C pathways. The vast majority of 
pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower, independently 
of their differences in near-term emission developments, converge to 
a global mitigation regime putting a significant value on GHG emission 
reductions in all regions and sectors.
3.6 Economics of Long-term Mitigation 
and Development Pathways, Including 
Mitigation Costs and Benefits
A complete appraisal of economic effects and welfare effects at 
different temperature levels would include the macroeconomic 
impacts of investments in low-carbon solutions and structural 
change away from emitting activities, co-benefits and adverse side 
effects of mitigation, (avoided) climate damages, as well as (reduced) 
adaptation costs, with high temporal, spatial and social heterogeneity 
using a  harmonised framework. If no such complete appraisal in 
a harmonised framework exists, key elements are emerging from the 
literature, and assessed in the following subsections: on aggregated 
economy-wide global mitigation costs (Section  3.6.1), on the 
economic benefits of avoiding climate impacts (Section  3.6.2), on 
economic benefits and costs associated with mitigation co-benefits 
and co-harms (Section  3.6.3) and on the distribution of economic 
implications between economic sectors and actors (Section 3.6.4).
Box 3.5 | Concepts and Modelling Frameworks Used for Quantifying Macroeconomic Effects 
of Mitigation
Most studies that have developed mitigation pathways have used a  cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) framework, which aim to 
compare the costs of different mitigation strategies designed to meet a given climate change mitigation goal (e.g., an emission-
reduction target or a temperature stabilisation target) but does not represent economic impacts from climate change itself, nor the 
associated economic benefits of avoided impacts. Other studies use modelling frameworks that represent the feedback of damages 
from climate change on the economy in a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) approach, which balances mitigation costs and benefits. This 
second type of study is represented in Section 3.6.2.
The marginal abatement cost of carbon, also called carbon price, is determined by the mitigation target under consideration: it 
describes the cost of reducing the last unit of emissions to reach the target at a given point in time. Total macroeconomic mitigation 
costs (or gains) aggregate the economy-wide impacts of investments in low-carbon solutions and structural changes away from 
emitting activities. The total macroeconomic effects of mitigation pathways are reported in terms of variations in economic output 
or consumption levels, measured against a  reference scenario, also called baseline, at various points in time or discounted over 
a given time period. Depending on the study, the reference scenario reflects specific assumptions about patterns of socio-economic 
development and assumes either no-climate policies or the climate policies in place or planned at the time the study was carried 
out. When available in the AR6 scenarios database, this second type of reference scenario, with trends from implemented policies 
until the end of 2020, has been chosen for computation of mitigation costs. In the vast majority of studies that have produced the 
body of work on the cost of mitigation assessed here, and in particular in all studies that have submitted global scenarios to the AR6 
scenarios database except (Schultes et al. 2021), the feedbacks of climate change impacts on the economic development pathways 
are not accounted for. This omission of climate impacts leads to overly optimistic economic projections in the reference scenarios, in 
particular in reference scenarios with no or limited mitigation action where the extent of global warming is the greatest. Mitigation 
cost estimates computed against no or limited policy reference scenarios therefore omit economic benefits brought by avoided climate 
change impact along mitigation pathways, and should be interpreted with care (Grant et al. 2020). When aggregate economic benefits 
from avoided climate change impacts are accounted for, mitigation is a welfare-enhancing strategy (Section 3.6.2).
If GDP or consumption in mitigation pathways are below the reference scenario levels, they are reported as losses or macroeconomic 
costs. Such cost estimates give an indication of how economic activity slows relative to the reference scenario; they do not necessarily 
describe, in absolute terms, a reduction of economic output or consumption levels relative to previous years along the pathway. Aggregate 
mitigation costs depend strongly on the modelling framework used and the assumptions about the reference scenario against which 
mitigation costs are measured, in particular whether the reference scenario is, or not, on the efficiency frontier of the economy. If the 
economy is assumed to be at the efficiency frontier in the reference scenario, mitigation inevitably leads to actual costs, at least in 
the short-run until the production frontier evolves with technical and structural change. Starting from a reference scenario that is not 
on the efficiency frontier opens the possibility to simultaneously reduce emissions and obtain macroeconomic gains, depending on the 
design and implementation of mitigation policies. A number of factors can result in reference scenarios below the efficiency frontier, for 
instance distorting labour taxes and/or fossil fuel subsidies, misallocation or under-utilisation of production factors such as involuntary 
unemployment, imperfect information or non-rational behaviours. Although these factors are pervasive, the modelling frameworks used 
to construct mitigation pathways are often limited in their ability to represent them (Köberle et al. 2021).
The absolute level of economic activity and welfare also strongly depends on the socio-economic pathway assumptions regarding, 
inter alia, evolutions in demography, productivity, education levels, inequality, and technical change and innovation. The GDP or 
consumption indicators reported in the database of scenarios, and synthesized below, represent the absolute level of aggregate 
economic activity or consumption but do not reflect welfare and well-being (Roberts et al. 2020), that notably depend on human-
needs satisfaction, distribution within society and inequality (Section 3.6.4).
Chapter 1 and  Annex III.I give further details of the economic concepts and modelling frameworks, including their limitations, used 
in this report, respectively.3.6.1 Economy-wide Implications of Mitigation
3.6.1.1 Global Economic Effects of Mitigation and Carbon 
Values in Mitigation Pathways
Estimates for the marginal abatement cost of carbon in mitigation 
pathways vary widely, depending on the modelling framework used 
and socio-economic, technological and policy assumptions. However, 
it is robust across modelling frameworks that the marginal abatement 
cost of carbon increases for lower temperature categories, with 
a higher increase in the short term than in the longer term (Figure 3.32, 
left panel) (high confidence). The marginal abatement cost of carbon 
increases non-linearly with the decrease of CO 2 emissions level, but 
the uncertainty in the range of estimates also increases (Figure 3.33). 
Mitigation pathways with low-energy consumption patterns exhibit 
lower carbon values (Méjean et al. 2019; Meyer et al. 2021). In the 
context of the COVID-19 pandemic recovery, Kikstra et al. (2021a) also 
show that a  low-energy-demand recovery scenario reduces carbon 
prices for a 1.5°C-consistent pathway by 19% compared to a scenario 
with energy demand trends restored to pre-pandemic levels.For optimisation modelling frameworks, the time profile of marginal 
abatement costs of carbon depends on the discount rate, with lower 
discount rates implying higher carbon values in the short term but 
lower values in the long term (Emmerling et al. 2019) (see also 
‘Discounting’ in Annex I: Glossary, and Annex III.I.2). In that case, the 
discount rate also influences the shape of the emissions trajectory, 
with low discount rates implying more emissions reduction in the 
short term and, for low-temperature categories, limiting CDR and 
temperature overshoot.
Pathways that correspond to NDCs announced prior to COP26 
in 2030 and strengthen action after 2030 imply higher marginal 
abatement costs of carbon in the longer run than pathways 
with stronger immediate global mitigation action (Figure  3.32b) 
(high confidence).2030104

Aggregate economic activity and consumption levels in mitigation 
pathways are primarily determined by socio-economic development 
pathways but are also influenced by the stringency of the mitigation 
goal and the policy choices to reach the goal (high confidence). 
Mitigation pathways in temperature categories C1 and C2 entail 
losses in global consumption with respect to their baselines  – not 
including benefits of avoided climate change impacts nor co-benefits 
or co-harms of mitigation action – that correspond to an annualised 
reduction of consumption growth by 0.04 (median value) (interquartile 
range [0.02–0.06]) percentage points over the century. For pathways in 
temperature categories C3 and C4 this reduction in global consumption 
growth is  0.03 (median value) (interquartile range [0.01–0.05]) 
percentage points over the century. In the majority of studies that 
focus on the economic effects of mitigation without accounting for 
climate damages, global economic growth and consumption growth 
is reduced compared to baseline scenarios (that omit damages from 
climate change), but mitigation pathways do not represent an absolute 
decrease of economic activity level (Figure 3.34b,c).
However, the possibility for increased economic activity following 
mitigation action, and conversely the risk of large negative economic 
effects, are not excluded. Some studies find that mitigation increases 
the speed of economic growth compared to baseline scenarios (Pollitt 
and Mercure 2018; Mercure et al. 2019). These studies are based on 
a  macroeconomic modelling framework that represent baselines below the efficiency frontier, based on non-equilibrium economic 
theory, and assume that mitigation is undertaken in such a  way 
that green investments do not crowd out investment in other parts 
of the economy – and therefore offers an economic stimulus. In the 
context of the recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, it is estimated that 
a green investment push would initially boost the economy while also 
reducing GHG emissions (IMF 2020; Pollitt et al. 2021). Conversely, 
several studies find that only a  GDP non-growth/degrowth or post-
growth approach enable reaching climate stabilisation below 2°C 
(Hardt and  O’Neill 2017;  D’Alessandro et al. 2020; Hickel and Kallis 
2020; Nieto et al. 2020), or to minimise the risks of reliance on high 
energy-GDP decoupling, large-scale CDR and large-scale renewable 
energy deployment (Keyßer and Lenzen 2021). Similarly, feedbacks of 
financial system risk amplifying shocks induced by mitigation policy 
and lead to a higher impact on economic activity (Stolbova et al. 2018).
Mitigation costs increase with the stringency of mitigation (Hof 
et al. 2017; Vrontisi et al. 2018) (Figure 3.34b,c), but are reduced when 
energy demand is moderated through energy efficiency and lifestyle 
changes (Fujimori et al. 2014; Bibas et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2018; Méjean 
et al. 2019), when sustainable transport policies are implemented 
(Zhang et al. 2018c), and when international technology cooperation is 
fostered (Schultes et al. 2018; Paroussos et al. 2019). Mitigation costs 
also depend on assumptions on availability and costs of technologies 
(Clarke et al. 2014; Bosetti et al. 2015; Dessens et al. 2016; Creutzig et al. 3.0 10

of innovation dynamics in modelling frameworks (Hoekstra et al. 
2017; Rengs et al. 2020) (Chapter 16), as well as the representation 
of investment dynamics and financing mechanisms (Iyer et al. 2015c; 
Mercure et al. 2019; Battiston et al. 2021). In particular, endogenous 
and induced innovation reduce technology costs over time, create 
path dependencies and reduce the macroeconomic cost of reaching 
a mitigation target (Section 1.7.1.2). Mitigation costs also depend on 
socio-economic assumptions (Hof et al. 2017; van Vuuren et al. 2020).
Mitigation pathways with early emissions reductions represent higher 
mitigation costs in the short-run but bring long-term gains for the 
economy compared to delayed transition pathways (high confidence). 
Pathways with earlier mitigation action bring higher long-term GDP 
than pathways reaching the same end-of-century temperature with 
weaker early action (Figure 3.34d). Comparing counterfactual history 
scenarios, Sanderson and  O’Neill (2020) also find that delayed 
mitigation action leads to higher peak costs. Rogelj et al. (2019b) 
and Riahi et al. (2021) also show that pathways with earlier timing 
of net zero CO 2 lead to higher transition costs but lower long-term 
mitigation costs, due to dynamic effects arising from lock-in avoidance 
and learning effects. For example, Riahi et al.(2021) find that for a 2°C 
target, the GDP losses (compared to a  reference scenario without 
impacts from climate change) in 2100 are 5–70% lower in pathways 
that avoid net negative CO 2 emissions and temperature overshoot 
than in pathways with overshoot. Accounting also for climate change 
damage, van der Wijst et al. (2021a) show that avoiding net negative 
emissions leads to a small increase in total discounted mitigation costs 
over 2020–2100, between 5% and 14% in their medium assumptions, 
but does not increase mitigation costs when damages are high and 
when using a low discount rate, and becomes economically attractive 
if damages are not fully reversible. The modelled cost-optimal balance 
of mitigation action over time strongly depends on the discount rate 
used to compute or evaluate mitigation pathways: lower discount 
rates favour earlier mitigation, reducing both temperature overshoot 
and reliance on net negative carbon emissions (Emmerling et al. 2019; Riahi et al. 2021). Mitigation pathways with weak early action 
corresponding to NDCs announced prior to COP26 in 2030 and 
strengthening action after 2030 to reach end-of-century temperature 
targets imply limited mitigation costs in 2030, compared to immediate 
global action pathways, but faster increase in costs post-2030, with 
implications for intergenerational equity (Aldy et al. 2016; Liu et al. 
2016; Vrontisi et al. 2018). Emissions trading policies reduce global 
aggregate mitigation costs, in particular in the context of achieving 
NDCs (Fujimori et al. 2015, 2016a; Böhringer et al. 2021; Edmonds 
et al. 2021), and change the distribution of mitigation costs between 
regions and countries (Section 3.6.1.2).
3.6.1.2  Regional Mitigation Costs and Effort-sharing Regimes
The economic repercussions of mitigation policies vary across 
countries (Aldy et al. 2016; Hof et al. 2017): regional variations 
exist in institutions, economic and technological development, and 
mitigation opportunities. For a globally uniform carbon price, carbon-
intensive and energy-exporting countries bear the highest economic 
costs because of a  deeper transformation of their economies and 
of trade losses in the fossil markets (Stern et al. 2012; Tavoni et al. 
2015; Böhringer et al. 2021). This finding is confirmed in Figure 3.35. 
Since carbon-intensive countries are often poorer, uniform global 
carbon prices raise equity concerns (Tavoni et al. 2015). On the other 
hand, the climate economic benefits of mitigating climate change 
will be larger in poorer countries (Cross-Working Group Box 1 in this 
chapter). This reduces policy regressivity but does not eliminate it 
(Taconet et al. 2020; Gazzotti et al. 2021). Together with co-benefits, 
such as health benefits of improved air quality, the economic benefits 
of mitigating climate change are likely to outweigh mitigation costs 
in many regions (Li et al. 2018, 2019; Scovronick et al. 2021).
Regional policy costs depend on the evaluation framework (Budolfson 
et al. 2021), policy design, including revenue recycling, and on 
international coordination, especially among trade partners. By 
fostering technological change and finance, climate cooperation can

generate economic benefits, both in large developing economies such 
as China and India (Paroussos et al. 2019) and industrialised regions 
such as Europe (Vrontisi et al. 2020). International coordination is 
a major driver of regional policy costs. Delayed participation in global 
mitigation efforts raises participation costs, especially in carbon-
intensive economies (Figure 3.35a. Trading systems and transfers can 
deliver cost savings and improve equity (Rose et al. 2017a). On the 
other hand, measures that reduce imports of energy-intensive goods 
such as carbon-border tax adjustment may imply costs outside of 
the policy jurisdiction and have international equity repercussions, 
depending on how they are designed (Böhringer et al. 2012, 2017; 
Cosbey et al. 2019) (Section 13.6.6).
An equitable global emission-trading scheme would require very 
large international financial transfers, in the order of several 
hundred billion USD per year (Tavoni et al. 2015; Bauer et al. 2020; 
van den Berg et al. 2020). The magnitude of transfers depends on the 
stringency of the climate goals and on the burden-sharing principle. 
Some interpretations of equitable burden sharing compliant with 
the Paris Agreement leads to negative carbon allowances for 
developed countries and some developing countries by mid-century 
(van  den  Berg et al. 2020), more stringent than cost-optimal 
pathways. International transfers also depend on the underlying 
socio-economic development (Leimbach and Giannousakis 2019), 
as these drive the mitigation costs of meeting the Paris Agreement (Rogelj et al. 2018b). By contrast, achieving equity without 
international markets would result in a  large discrepancy in 
regional carbon prices, up to a factor of 100 (Bauer et al. 2020). The 
efficiency-sovereignty trade-off can be partly resolved by allowing 
for limited differentiation of regional carbon prices: moderate 
financial transfers substantially reduce inefficiencies by narrowing 
the carbon price spread (Bauer et al. 2020).
3.6.1.3 Investments in Mitigation Pathways
Figures  3.36 and  3.37 show increased investment needs in the 
energy sector in lower temperature categories, and a  major shift 
away from fossil fuel generation and extraction towards electricity, 
including for system enhancements for electricity transmission, 
distribution and storage, and low-carbon technologies. Investment 
needs in the electricity sector are  2.3 trillion USD2015 yr–1 
over 2023–2050 on average for C1 pathways, 2 trillion USD 
for C2 pathways,  1.7  trillion  USD for C3,  1.2 trillion USD for C4 
and  0.9–1.1 billion USD for C5/C6/C7 (mean values for pathways 
in each temperature category). The regional pattern of power 
sector investments broadly mirrors the global picture. However, the 
bulk of investment requirements are in medium- and low-income 
regions. These results from the AR6 scenarios database corroborate 
the findings from McCollum et al. (2018a), Zhou et al. (2019) and 
Bertram et al. (2021).

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic recovery, Kikstra et al. 
(2021a) show that a low-energy-demand recovery scenario reduces 
energy investments required until 2030 for a  1.5°C consistent 
pathway by  9% (corresponding to reducing total required energy 
investment by USD1.8 trillion) compared to a scenario with energy 
demand trends restored to pre-pandemic levels.
Few studies extend the scope of the investment needs quantification 
beyond the energy sector. Fisch-Romito and Guivarch (2019) 
and Ó  Broin and Guivarch (2017) assess investment needs for 
transportation infrastructures and find lower investment needs in 
low-carbon pathways, due to a  reduction in transport activity and 
a  shift towards less road construction, compared to high-carbon pathways. Rozenberg and Fay (2019) estimate the funding needs 
to close the service gaps in water and sanitation, transportation, 
electricity, irrigation, and flood protection in thousands of scenarios, 
showing that infrastructure investment paths compatible with full 
decarbonisation in the second half of the century need not cost more 
than more-polluting alternatives. Investment needs are estimated 
between 2% to 8% of GDP , depending on the quality and quantity of 
services targeted, the timing of investments, construction costs, and 
complementary policies.
Chapter 15 also reports investment requirements in global mitigation 
pathways in the near term, compares them to recent investment 
trends, and assesses financing issues.

Mitigation reduces the extent of climate change and its impacts on ecosystems, infrastructure, and livelihoods. This box summarises 
elements from the AR6 WGII report on aggregate climate change impacts and risks, putting them into the context of mitigation 
pathways. AR6 WGII provides an assessment of current lines of evidence regarding potential climate risks with future climate change, 
and therefore, the avoided risks from mitigating climate change. Regional and sectoral climate risks to physical and social systems are 
assessed (AR6 WGII Chapters 2–15). Over 100 of these are identified as Key Risks (KRs) and further synthesised by WGII Chapter 16 
into eight overarching Representative Key Risks (RKRs) relating to low-lying coastal systems; terrestrial and ocean ecosystems; critical 
physical infrastructure, networks and services; living standards; human health; food security; water security; and peace and mobility 
(AR6 WGII Section  16.5.2). The RKR assessment finds that risks increase with global warming level, and also depend on socio-
economic development conditions, which shape exposure and vulnerability, and adaptation opportunities and responses. ‘Reasons 
For Concern’, another WGII aggregate climate-impacts risk framing, are also assessed to increase with climate change, with increasing 
risk for unique and threatened systems, extreme weather events, distribution of impacts, global aggregate impacts, and large-scale 
singular events (AR6 WGII Chapter  16). For human systems, in general, the poor and disadvantaged are found to have greater 
exposure level and vulnerability for a given hazard. With some increase in global average warming from today expected regardless 
of mitigation efforts, human and natural systems will be exposed to new conditions and additional adaptation will be needed (AR6 
WGII Chapter 18). The range of dates for when a specific warming level could be reached depends on future global emissions, with 
significant overlap of ranges across emissions scenarios due to climate system response uncertainties (AR6 WGI Tables 4.2 and 4.5). 
The speed at which the climate changes is relevant to adaptation timing, possibilities, and net impacts.
The AR6 WGII also assesses the growing literature estimating the global aggregate economic impacts of climate change and the social 
cost of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (AR6 WGII Cross-Working Box ECONOMIC: Estimating Global Economic Impacts 
from Climate Change and the Social Cost of Carbon in AR6 WGII Chapter  16). The former represents aggregate estimates that 
inform assessment of the economic benefits of mitigation. This literature is characterised by significant variation in the estimates, 
including for today’s level of global warming, due primarily to fundamental differences in methods, but also differences in impacts 
included, representation of socio-economic exposure, consideration of adaptation, aggregation approach, and assumed persistence 
of damages. The AR6 WGII’s assessment identifies different approaches to quantification of aggregated economic impacts of climate 
change, including: physical modelling of impact processes, such as projected mortality rates from climate risks such as heat, vector- or 
waterborne diseases that are then monetised; structural economic modelling of impacts on production, consumption, and markets for 
economic sectors and regional economies; and statistical estimation of impacts based on observed historical responses to weather 
and climate. The AR6 WGII finds that variation in estimated global economic impacts increases with warming in all methodologies, 
indicating higher risk in terms of economic impacts at higher temperatures (high confidence). Many estimates are non-linear with 
marginal economic impacts increasing with temperature, although some show declining marginal economic impacts with temperature, 
and functional forms cannot be determined for all studies. The AR6 WGII’s assessment finds that the lack of comparability between 
methodologies does not allow for identification of robust ranges of global economic impact estimates (high confidence). Further, AR6 
WGII identifies evaluating and reconciling differences in methodologies as a research priority for facilitating use of the different lines 
of evidence (high confidence). However, there are estimates that are higher than AR5, indicating that global aggregate economic 
impacts could be higher than previously estimated (low confidence due to the lack of comparability across methodologies and lack of 
robustness of estimates) (AR6 WGII Cross-Working Box ECONOMIC).
Conceptually, the difference in aggregate economic impacts from climate change between two given temperature levels represents 
the aggregate economic benefits arising from avoided climate change impacts due to mitigation action. A subset of the studies whose 
estimates were evaluated by AR6 WGII (5 of 15) are used to derive illustrative estimates of aggregate economic benefits in 2100 arising 3.6.2 Economic Benefits of Avoiding Climate Change Impacts

Cross-Working Group Box  1, Figure  1 | Global aggregate economic benefits of mitigation from avoided climate change impacts in 2100 
corresponding to shifting from a higher temperature category (4°C (3.75°C–4.25°C), 3°C (2.75°C–3.25°C), or above 2°C (2°C–2.5°C), to below 
2°C (1.5°C–2°C), as well as from below 2°C to below 1.5°C (1°C–1.5°C)), from the five studies discussed in the text.  Panel (a) is adapted from AR6 
WGII Cross-Working Group Box ECONOMIC, Figure 1, showing global aggregate economic impact estimates (% global GDP loss relative to GDP without additional 
climate change) by temperature change level. All estimates are shown in grey. Estimates used for the computation of estimated benefits in 2100 in panel (b) are 
coloured for the selected studies, which provide results for different temperature change levels. See the AR6 WGII AR6 WGII Cross-Working Group Box ECONOMIC for

from avoided climate change (Howard and Sterner 2017; Burke et al. 2018; Pretis et al. 2018; Kahn et al. 2019; Takakura et al. 2019). 
Burke et al. (2018), Pretis et al. (2018) and Kahn et al. (2019) are examples of statistical estimations of historical relationships between 
temperature and economic growth, whereas Takakura et al. (2019) is an example of structural modelling, which evaluates selected 
impact channels (impacts on agriculture productivity, undernourishment, heat-related mortality, labour productivity, cooling/heating 
demand, hydro-electric and thermal power generation capacity and fluvial flooding) with a general equilibrium model. Howard and 
Sterner (2017) and Rose et al. (2017b) estimate damage functions that can be used to compute the economic benefits of mitigation 
from avoiding a given temperature level for a lower one. Howard and Sterner (2017) estimate a damage function from a meta-
analysis of aggregate economic impact studies, while Rose et al. (2017b) derive global functions by temperature and socio-economic 
drivers from stylised aggregate cost-benefit-analysis (CBA) integrated assessment models (IAMs) using diagnostic experiments. Cross-
Working Group Box 1, Figure 1 summarises the global aggregate economic benefits in 2100 of avoided climate change impacts from 
individual studies corresponding to shifting from a higher temperature category (above 3°C, below 3°C or below 2.5°C) to below 2°C, 
as well as from below 2°C to below 1.5°C. Benefits are positive and increase with the temperature gap for any given study, and this 
result is robust across socio-economic scenarios. The Figure provides evidence of a wide range of quantifications, and illustrates the 
important differences associated with methods. Panel a puts the studies used to calculate aggregate economic benefits arising from 
avoided impacts into the context of the broader set of studies assessed in WGII (Section 16.6.2 of this report, AR6 WGII Cross-Working 
Group Box ECONOMIC,). However, economic benefits in 2100 arising from avoided impacts cannot be directly computed from damage 
estimates across this broader set of studies, due to inconsistencies – different socio-economic assumptions, scenario designs, and 
counterfactual reference scenarios across studies. Furthermore, these types of estimates cannot be readily compared to mitigation 
cost estimates. The comparison would require a framework that ensures consistency in assumptions and dynamics and allows for 
consideration of benefits and costs along the entire pathway.
Aggregate benefits from avoided impacts expressed in GDP terms, as in Figure 1, do not encompass all avoided climate risks, adaptation 
possibilities, and do not represent their influence on well-being and welfare (AR6 WGII Cross-Working Group Box ECONOMIC). 
Methodological challenges for economic impact estimates include representing uncertainty and variability, capturing interactions and 
spillovers, considering distributional effects, representing micro- and macro-adaptation processes, specifying non-gradual damages 
and non-linearities, and improving understanding of potential long-run growth effects. In addition, the economic benefits aggregated 
Cost-benefit analyses (CBA) aim to balance all costs and benefits 
in a  unified framework (Nordhaus, 2008). Estimates of economic 
benefits from avoided climate change impacts depend on the types 
of damages accounted for, the assumed exposure and vulnerability 
to these damages as well as the adaptation capacity, which in 
turn are based on the development pathway assumed (Cross-
Working Group Box 1 in this chapter). CBA IAMs raised criticism, in 
particular for omitting elements of dynamic realism, such as inertia, 
induced innovation and path dependence, in their representation of 
mitigation (Grubb et al. 2021), and for underestimating damages 
from climate change, missing non-monetary damages, the uncertain 
and heterogeneous nature of damages and the risk of catastrophic 
damages (Stern 2013, 2016; Diaz and Moore 2017; NASEM 2017; 
Pindyck 2017; Stoerk et al. 2018; Stern and Stiglitz 2021). Emerging 
literature has started to address those gaps, and integrated into cost-
benefit frameworks the account of heterogeneity of climate damage 
and inequality (Dennig et al. 2015; Budolfson et al. 2017; Fleurbaey 
et al. 2019; Kornek et al. 2021), damages with higher persistence, 
including damages on capital and growth (Moyer et al. 2014; Dietz 
and Stern 2015; Moore and Diaz 2015; Guivarch and Pottier 2018; 
Ricke et al. 2018; Piontek et al. 2019), risks of tipping points (Cai et al. 
2015, 2016; Lontzek et al. 2015; Lemoine and Traeger 2016; van der 
Ploeg and de Zeeuw 2018; Cai and Lontzek 2019; Nordhaus 2019; 
Yumashev et al. 2019; Taconet et al. 2021) and damages to natural 
capital and non-market goods (Tol 1994; Sterner and Persson 2008; 
Bastien-Olvera and Moore 2020; Drupp and Hänsel 2021).
Each of these factors, when accounted for in a  CBA framework, 
tends to increase the welfare benefit of mitigation, thus leading 
to stabilisation at a  lower temperature in optimal mitigation 
pathways. The limitations in CBA modelling frameworks remain 
significant, their ability to represent all damages incomplete, and 
the uncertainty in estimates remains large. However, emerging 
evidence suggests that, even without accounting for co-benefits 
of mitigation on other sustainable development dimensions (see 
Section 3.6.3 for further details about on co-benefits), global benefits 
of pathways that limit warming to 2°C outweigh global mitigation 
costs over the 21st century: depending on the study, the reason for 
this result lies in assumptions of economic damages from climate 
change in the higher end of available estimates (Moore and Diaz 
2015; Ueckerdt et al. 2019; Brown and Saunders 2020; Glanemann 
et al. 2020), in the introduction of risks of tipping points (Cai and Lontzek 2019), in the consideration of damages to natural capital 
and non-market goods (Bastien-Olvera and Moore 2020) or in the 
combination of updated representations of carbon cycle and climate 
modules, updated damage estimates and/or updated representations 
of economic and mitigation dynamics (Dietz and Stern 2015; Hänsel 
et al. 2020; Wei et al. 2020; van der Wijst et al. 2021b). In the studies 
cited above that perform a sensitivity analysis, this result is found to 
be robust to a wide range of assumptions on social preferences (in 
particular, on inequality aversion and pure rate-of-time preference) 
and holds except if assumptions of economic damages from climate 
change are in the lower end of available estimates and the pure rate-
of-time preference is in the higher range of values usually considered 
(typically above 1.5%). However, although such pathways bring net 
benefits over time (in terms of aggregate discounted present value), 
they involve distributional consequences and transition costs (Brown 
et al. 2020; Brown and Saunders 2020) (Sections 3.6.1.2 and 3.6.4).
The standard discounted utilitarian framework dominates CBA, thus 
often limiting the analysis to the question of discounting. CBA can be 
expanded to accommodate a wider variety of ethical values to assess 
mitigation pathways (Fleurbaey et al. 2019). The role of ethical values 
with regard to inequality and the situation of the worse off (Adler 
et al. 2017), risk (van den Bergh and Botzen 2014; Drouet et al. 2015), 
and population size (Scovronick et al. 2017; Méjean et al. 2020) has 
been explored. In most of these studies, the optimal climate policy is 
found to be more stringent than the one obtained using a standard 
discounted utilitarian criterion.
Comparing economic costs and benefits of mitigation raises a number 
of methodological and fundamental difficulties. Monetising the full 
range of climate change impacts is extremely hard, if not impossible 
(AR6 WGII Chapter 16), as is aggregating costs and benefits over time 
and across individuals when values are heterogeneous (Chapter 1; 
AR5 WGIII Chapter 3). Other approaches should thus be considered 
in supplement for decision-making (Chapter 1 and Section 1.7), in 
particular cost-effectiveness approaches that analyse how to achieve 
a defined mitigation objective at least cost or while also reaching 
other societal goals (Koomey 2013; Kaufman et al. 2020; Köberle 
et al. 2021; Stern and Stiglitz 2021). In cost-effectiveness studies 
too, incorporating benefits from avoided climate damages influences 
the results and leads to more stringent mitigation in the short term 
(Drouet et al. 2021; Schultes et al. 2021).at the global scale provide limited insights into regional heterogeneity. Global economic impact studies with regional estimates 
find large differences across regions in absolute and percentage terms, with developing and transitional economies typically more 
vulnerable. Furthermore, (avoided) impacts for poorer households and poorer countries can represent a smaller share in aggregate 
quantifications expressed in GDP terms or monetary terms, compared to their influence on well-being and welfare (Hallegatte et al. 
2020; Markhvida et al. 2020). Finally, as noted by AR6 WGII, other lines of evidence regarding climate risks, beyond monetary estimates, 
should be considered in decision-making, including Key Risks and Reasons for Concern.Cross-Working Group Box 1 (continued)
3.6.3 Aggregate Economic Implication of Mitigation 
Co-benefits and Trade-offs
Mitigation actions have co-benefits and trade-offs with other 
sustainable development dimensions (Section  3.7) beyond climate 
change, which imply welfare effects and economic effects, as well 
as other implications beyond the economic dimension. The majority 
of quantifications of mitigation costs and benefits synthesized 
in Sections  3.6.1 and  3.6.2 do not account for these economic 
benefits and costs associated with co-benefits and trade-offs along 
mitigation pathways.
Systematic reviews of the literature on co-benefits and trade-offs 
from mitigation actions have shown that only a  small portion of 
articles provide economic quantifications (Deng et al. 2017; Karlsson 
et al. 2020). Most economic quantifications use monetary valuation 
approaches. Improved air quality, and associated health effects, 
are the co-benefit category dominating the literature (Markandya 
et al. 2018; Vandyck et al. 2018; Scovronick et al. 2019; Howard et al. 
2020; Karlsson et al. 2020b; Rauner et al. 2020a,b), but some studies 
cover other categories, including health effects from diet change 
(Springmann et al. 2016b) and biodiversity impacts (Rauner et al. 
2020a). Regarding health effects from air quality improvement and 
from diet change, co-benefits are shown to be of the same order of 
magnitude as mitigation costs (Thompson et al. 2014; Springmann 
et al. 2016a,b; Markandya et al. 2018; Scovronick et al. 2019b; 
Howard et al. 2020; Rauner et al. 2020a,b; Liu et al. 2021; Yang 
et al. 2021). Co-benefits from improved air quality are concentrated 
sooner in time than economic benefits from avoided climate change 
impacts (Karlsson et al. 2020), such that when accounting both 
for positive health impacts from reduced air pollution and for the 
negative climate effect of reduced cooling aerosols, optimal GHG 
mitigation pathways exhibit immediate and continual net economic 
benefits (Scovronick et al. 2019a). However, AR6 WGI Chapter  6 
(Section 6.7.3) shows a delay in air pollution reduction benefits when 
they come from climate change mitigation policies compared with air 
pollution reduction policies.
Achieving co-benefits is not automatic but results from coordinated 
policies and implementation strategies (Clarke et al. 2014; McCollum 
et al. 2018a). Similarly, avoiding trade-offs requires targeted policies 
(van Vuuren et al. 2015; Bertram et al. 2018). There is limited 
evidence of such pathways, but the evidence shows that mitigation 
pathways designed to reach multiple Sustainable Development 
Goals instead of focusing exclusively on emissions reductions, 
result in limited additional costs compared to the increased benefits 
(Cameron et al. 2016; McCollum et al. 2018b; Fujimori et al. 2020a; 
Sognnaes et al. 2021).
3.6.4 Structural Change, Employment and 
Distributional Issues Along Mitigation Pathways
Beyond aggregate effects at the economy-wide level, mitigation 
pathways have heterogeneous economic implications for different 
sectors and different actors. Climate-related factors are only one 
driver of the future structure of the economy, of the future of employment, and of future inequality trends, as overarching trends in 
demographics, technological change (innovation, automation, etc.), 
education and institutions will be prominent drivers. For instance, 
Rao et al. (2019b) and Benveniste et al. (2021) have shown that 
income inequality projections for the 21st century vary significantly, 
depending on socio-economic assumptions related to demography, 
education levels, social public spending and migrations. However, 
the sections below focus on climate-related factors, both climate-
mitigation actions themselves and the climate change impacts 
avoided along mitigation pathways, effects on structural change, 
including employment, and distributional effects.
3.6.4.1  Economic Structural Change and Employment 
in Long-term Mitigation Pathways
Mitigation pathways entail transformation of the energy sector, with 
structural change away from fossil energy and towards low-carbon 
energy (Section 3.3), as well as broader economic structural change, 
including industrial restructuring and reductions in carbon-intensive 
activities in parallel to extensions in low-carbon activities.
Mitigation affects work through multiple channels, which impacts 
geographies, sectors and skill categories differently (Fankhaeser 
et al. 2008; Bowen et al. 2018; Malerba and Wiebe 2021). Aggregate 
employment impacts of mitigation pathways mainly depend on 
the aggregate macroeconomic effect of mitigation (Sections  3.6.1 
and  3.6.2) and of mitigation policy design and implementation 
(Freire-González 2018) (Section 4.2.6.3). Most studies that quantify 
overall employment implications of mitigation policies are conducted 
at the national or regional scales (Section 4.2.6.3), or sectoral scales 
(e.g., see Chapter 6 for energy sector jobs). The evidence is limited 
at the multinational or global scale, but studies generally find 
small differences in aggregate employment in mitigation pathways 
compared to baselines: the sign of the difference depends on the 
assumptions and modelling frameworks used and the policy design 
tested, with some studies or policy design cases leading to small 
increases in employment (Chateau and Saint-Martin 2013; Pollitt 
et al. 2015; Barker et al. 2016; Garcia-Casals et al. 2019; Fujimori 
et al. 2020a; Vrontisi et al. 2020; Malerba and Wiebe 2021) and other 
studies or policy design cases leading to small decreases (Chateau 
and Saint-Martin 2013; Vandyck et al. 2016). The small variations in 
aggregate employment hide substantial reallocation of jobs across 
sectors, with jobs creation in some sectors and jobs destruction in 
others. Mitigation action through thermal renovation of buildings, 
installation and maintenance of low-carbon generation, and the 
expansion of public transit lead to job creation, while jobs are lost 
in fossil fuel extraction, energy supply and energy-intensive sectors 
in mitigation pathways (von Stechow et al. 2015, 2016; Barker et al. 
2016; Fuso Nerini et al. 2018; Perrier and Quirion 2018; Pollitt and 
Mercure 2018; Dominish et al. 2019; Garcia-Casals et al. 2019). In 
the energy sector, job losses in the fossil fuel sector are found to 
be compensated by gains in wind and solar jobs, leading to a net 
increase in energy sector jobs in 2050 in a  mitigation pathway 
compatible with stabilisation of the temperature increase below 
2°C (Pai et al. 2021). Employment effects also differ by geographies, 
with energy-importing regions benefiting from net job creations but 
energy-exporting regions experiencing very small gains or suffering 
from net job destruction (Barker et al. 2016; Pollitt and Mercure 2018; 
Garcia-Casals et al. 2019; Malerba and Wiebe 2021). Coal phase-out 
raises acute issues of just transition for the coal-dependent countries 
(Spencer et al. 2018; Jakob et al. 2020) (Section 4.5 and Box 6.2).
Mitigation action also affects employment through avoided climate 
change impacts. Mitigation reduces the risks to human health and 
associated impacts on labour and helps protect workers from the 
occupational health and safety hazards imposed by climate change 
(Kjellstrom et al. 2016, 2018, 2019; Levi et al. 2018; Day et al. 2019) 
(AR6 WGII Chapter 16).
3.6.4.2 Distributional Implications of Long-term 
Mitigation Pathways
Mitigation policies can have important distributive effects between 
and within countries, either reducing or increasing economic 
inequality and poverty, depending on policy instruments’ design 
and implementation (see Section  3.6.1.2 for an assessment of 
the distribution of mitigation costs across regions in mitigation 
pathways; Sections 3.7 and 4.2.2.6, and Box 3.6 for an assessment of 
the fairness and ambition of NDCs; and Section 4.5 for an assessment 
of national mitigation pathways along the criteria of equity, including 
Just Transition, as well as Section 17.4.5 for equity in a Just Transition). 
For instance, emissions taxation has important distributive effects, 
both between and within income groups (Cronin et al. 2018b; Klenert 
et al. 2018; Pizer and Sexton 2019; Douenne 2020; Steckel et al. 
2021). These effects are more significant in some sectors, such as 
transport, and depend on country-specific consumption structures 
(Dorband et al. 2019; Fullerton and Muehlegger 2019; Ohlendorf 
et al. 2021). However, revenues from emissions taxation can be used 
to lessen their regressive distributional impacts or even turn the 
policy into a  progressive policy reducing inequality and/or leading 
to gains for lower-income households (Cameron et al. 2016; Jakob 
and Steckel 2016; Fremstad and Paul 2019; Fujimori et al. 2020b; 
Böhringer et al. 2021; Budolfson et al. 2021; Soergel et al. 2021b; 
Steckel et al. 2021). Mitigation policies may affect the poorest 
through effects on energy and food prices (Hasegawa et al. 2015; 
Fujimori et al. 2019). Markkanen and Anger-Kraavi (2019) and Lamb 
et al. (2020) synthesize evidence from the existing literature on social 
co-impacts of climate change mitigation policy and their implications 
for inequality. They show that most policies can compound or 
lessen inequalities depending on contextual factors, policy design 
and policy implementation, but that negative inequality impacts of 
climate policies can be mitigated (and possibly even prevented), 
when distributive and procedural justice are taken into consideration 
in all stages of policymaking, including policy planning, development 
and implementation, and when focusing on the carbon intensity 
of lifestyles, sufficiency and equity, well-being and decent living 
standards for all (Section 13.6).
Mitigation pathways also affect economic inequalities between 
and within countries, and poverty, through the reduction of climate 
change impacts that fall more heavily on low-income countries, 
communities and households, and exacerbate poverty (AR6 WGII 
Chapters  8 and 16). Higher levels of warming are projected to 
generate higher inequality between countries as well as within them (AR6 WGII Chapter 16). Through avoiding impacts, mitigation thus 
reduces economic inequalities and poverty (high confidence).
A few studies consider both mitigation policies’ distributional impacts 
and avoided climate change impacts on inequalities along mitigation 
pathways. Rezai et al. (2018) find that unmitigated climate change 
impacts increase inequality, whereas mitigation has the potential 
to reverse this effect. Considering uncertainty in socio-economic 
assumptions, emission pathways, mitigation costs, temperature 
response, and climate damage, Taconet et al. (2020) show that the 
uncertainties associated with socio-economic assumptions and 
damage estimates are the main drivers of future inequalities between 
countries and that in most cases mitigation policies reduce future 
inequalities between countries. Gazzotti et al. (2021) show that 
inequality persists in 2°C-consistent pathways due to regressivity 
of residual climate damages. However, the evidence on mitigation 
pathways’ implications for global inequality and poverty remains 
limited, and the modelling frameworks used have limited ability to 
fully represent the different dimensions of inequality and poverty and 
all the mechanisms by which mitigation affects inequality and poverty 
(Rao et al. 2017a; Emmerling and Tavoni 2021; Jafino et al. 2021).
3.7 Sustainable Development, 
Mitigation and Avoided Impacts
3.7.1 Synthesis Findings on Mitigation 
and Sustainable Development
Rapid and effective climate mitigation is a  necessary part of sustainable 
development (high confidence) (Cross-Chapter Box 5 in Chapter 4), 
but the latter can only be realised if climate mitigation becomes 
integrated with sustainable development policies (high confidence). 
Targeted policy areas must include healthy nutrition, sustainable 
consumption and production, inequality and poverty alleviation, 
air quality and international collaboration (high confidence). 
Lower energy demand enables synergies between mitigation and 
sustainability, with lower reliance on CDR (high confidence).
This section covers the long-term interconnection of sustainable 
development and mitigation, taking forward the holistic vision of 
sustainable development described in the SDGs (Brandi 2015; Leal 
Filho et al. 2018). Recent studies have explored the aggregated 
impact of mitigation for multiple sustainable-development 
dimensions (Hasegawa et al. 2014; Bertram et al. 2018; Fuso Nerini 
et al. 2018; Grubler et al. 2018; McCollum et al. 2018b; Soergel et al. 
2021a; van Vuuren et al. 2019). For instance, Figure  3.38 shows 
selected mitigation co-benefits and trade-offs based on a subset 
of models and scenarios, since so far many IAMs do not have 
a comprehensive coverage of SDGs (Rao et al. 2017a; van Soest et al. 
2019). Figure 3.38 shows that mitigation likely leads to increased 
forest cover (SDG 15  – life on land) and reduced mortality from 
ambient PM2.5 pollution (SDG 3  – good health and well-being) 
compared to reference scenarios. However, mitigation policies 
can also cause higher food prices and an increased population at 
risk of hunger (SDG 2  – zero hunger) and relying on solid fuels 
(SDG 3 – good health and well-being; and SDG 7 – affordable and 
clean energy) as side effects. These trade-offs can be compensated 
through targeted support measures and/or additional sustainable 
development policies (Cameron et al. 2016; Bertram et al. 2018; 
Fujimori et al. 2019; Soergel et al. 2021a).
The synthesis of the interplay between climate mitigation and 
sustainable development is shown in Figure  3.39. Panel a  shows 
the reduction in population affected by climate impacts at  1.5°C 
compared to 3°C according to sustainability domains (Byers et al. 
2018). Reducing warming reduces the population impacted by all 
impact categories shown (high confidence). The left panel does not 
take into account any side effects of mitigation efforts or policies to 
reduce warming: only reductions in climate impacts. This underscores 
that mitigation is an integral basis for comprehensive sustainable 
development (Watts et al. 2015).
Panels b and c of Figure  3.39 show the effects of  1.5°C 
mitigation  policies compared to current national policies: narrow mitigation policies (averaged over several models, middle panel), 
and policies integrating sustainability considerations (right panel of 
Figure  3.39, based on the Illustrative Mitigation Pathway ‘Shifting 
Pathways’ (IMP-SP) (Soergel et al. 2021a)). Note that neither middle 
nor right panels include climate impacts.
Areas of co-benefits include human health, ambient air pollution 
and other specific kinds of pollution, while areas of trade-off include 
food access, habitat loss and mineral resources (medium confidence). 
For example, action consistent with 1.5°C in the absence of energy-
demand reduction measures require large quantities of CDR, which, 
depending on the type used, are likely to negatively impact both food 
availability and areas for biodiversity (Fujimori et al. 2018; Ohashi 
et al. 2019; Roelfsema et al. 2020).
Mitigation to 1.5°C reduces climate impacts on sustainability (left). 
Policies integrating sustainability and mitigation (right) have far 
fewer trade-offs than narrow mitigation policies (middle).

Figure 3.38 | Effect of climate change mitigation on different dimensions of sustainable development: shown are mitigation scenarios compatible with

Scenario sources for box plots: single scenarios from: (i) Fujimori et al. (2020a); (ii) Soergel et al. (2021a); multi-model scenario set from CD-LINKS (McCollum et al. 2018b; 
Fujimori et al. 2019; Roelfsema et al. 2020). For associated methods, see also Cameron et al. (2016) and Rafaj et al. (2021). The reference scenario for Fujimori et al. (2020a) 
is no-policy baseline; for all other studies, it includes current climate policies. In the ‘Food prices’ and ‘Risk of hunger’ panels, scenarios from CD-LINKS include a price cap of 
USD200 tCO 2-eq for land-use emissions (Fujimori et al. 2019). For the other indicators, CD-LINKS scenarios without price cap (Roelfsema et al. 2020) are used due to SDG 
indicator availability. In the ‘Premature deaths’ panel, a well-below 2°C scenario from Fujimori et al. (2020a) is used in place of a 1.5°C scenario due to data availability, and 
all scenarios are indexed to their 2015 values due to a spread in reported levels between models. SDG icons were created by the United Nations.

useful energy in buildings and transport. ‘Food prices’ and ‘Risk of hunger’ in the middle panel are the same as in Figure 3.38.
3.7.1.1 Policies Combining Mitigation  
and Sustainable Development
These findings indicate that holistic policymaking integrating 
sustainability objectives alongside mitigation will be important in 
attaining Sustainable Development Goals (van Vuuren et al. 2015, 
2018; Bertram et al. 2018; Fujimori et al. 2018; Hasegawa et al. 
2018; Liu et al. 2020a; Honegger et al. 2021; Soergel et al. 2021a). 
Mitigation policies which target direct sector-level regulation, early 
mitigation action, and lifestyle changes have beneficial sustainable 
development outcomes across air pollution, food, energy and water 
(Bertram et al. 2018).
These policies include ones around stringent air quality (Kinney 2018; 
Rafaj et al. 2018; Soergel et al. 2021a); efficient and safe demand-
side technologies, especially cook stoves (Cameron et al. 2016); 
lifestyle changes (Bertram et al. 2018; Grubler et al. 2018; Soergel 
et al. 2021a); industrial and sectoral policy (Bertram et al. 2018); 
agricultural and food policies (including food waste) (van Vuuren 
et al. 2019; Soergel et al. 2021a); international cooperation (Soergel 
et al. 2021a); as well as economic policies described in Section 3.6. 
Recent research shows that mitigation is compatible with reductions 
in inequality and poverty (Box 3.6).Lower demand  – for example, for energy and land-intensive 
consumption such as meat  – represents a  synergistic strategy for 
achieving ambitious climate mitigation without compromising 
Sustainable Development Goals (high confidence) (Bertram et al. 
2018; Grubler et al. 2018; van Vuuren et al. 2018; Kikstra et al. 2021b; 
Soergel et al. 2021a). This is especially true for reliance on BECCS 
(Hickel et al. 2021; Keyßer and Lenzen 2021). Options that reduce 
agricultural demand (e.g., dietary change, reduced food waste) can 
have co-benefits for adaptation through reductions in demand for 
land and water (Bertram et al. 2018; Grubler et al. 2018; IPCC 2019a; 
Soergel et al. 2021a).
While the impacts of climate change on agricultural output are 
expected to increase the population at risk of hunger, there is 
evidence suggesting population growth will be the dominant 
driver of hunger and undernourishment in Africa in 2050 (Hall et al. 
2017). Meeting SDG 5, relating to gender equality and reproductive 
rights, could substantially lower population growth, leading to 
a  global population lower than the 95% prediction range of the 
UN projections (Abel et al. 2016). Meeting SDG 5 (gender equality, 
including via voluntary family planning (O’Sullivan 2018)) could thus 
minimise the risks to SDG 2 (zero hunger) that are posed by meeting 
SDG 13 (climate action).
Box 3.6 | Poverty and Inequality
There is high confidence (medium evidence, high agreement) that the eradication of extreme poverty and universal access to energy 
can be achieved without resulting in significant GHG emissions (Tait and Winkler 2012; Chakravarty and Tavoni 2013; Pachauri et al. 
2013; Pachauri 2014; Rao 2014; Hubacek et al. 2017b; Poblete-Cazenave et al. 2021). There is also high agreement in the literature 
that a focus on well-being and decent living standards for all can reduce disparities in access to basic needs for services concurrently 
with climate mitigation (Section 5.2). Mitigation pathways in which national redistribution of carbon-pricing revenues is combined with 
international climate finance, achieve poverty reduction globally (Fujimori et al. 2020b; Soergel et al. 2021b). Carbon-pricing revenues 
in mitigation pathways consistent with limiting temperature increase to 2°C could also contribute to finance investment needs for 
basic infrastructure (Jakob et al. 2016) and the achievement of the SDGs (Franks et al. 2018).
Several studies conclude that reaching higher income levels globally, beyond exiting extreme poverty, and achieving more qualitative 
social objectives and well-being, are associated with higher emissions (Ribas et al. 2017, 2019; Hubacek et al. 2017b; Fischetti 2018; 
Scherer et al. 2018). Studies give divergent results on the effect of economic inequality reduction on emissions, with either an increase 
or a decrease in emissions (Berthe and Elie 2015; Lamb and Rao 2015; Grunewald et al. 2017; Hubacek et al. 2017a,b; Jorgenson et al. 
2017; Knight et al. 2017; Mader 2018; Rao and Min 2018; Liu et al. 2019; Sager 2019; Baležentis et al. 2020; Liobikienė 2020; Liobikienė 
and Rimkuvienė 2020; Liu et al. 2020b; Millward-Hopkins and Oswald 2021). However, the absolute effect of economic inequality 
reduction on emissions remains moderate, under the assumptions tested. For instance, Sager (2019) finds that a full redistribution 
of income leading to equality among US households in a counterfactual scenario for 2009 would raise emissions by 2.3%; and Rao 
and Min (2018) limit to 8% the maximum plausible increase in emissions that would accompany the reduction of the global Gini 
coefficient from its current level of 0.55 to a level of 0.3 by 2050. Similarly, reduced income inequality would lead to a global energy-
demand increase of 7% (Oswald et al. 2021). Reconciling mitigation and inequality reduction objectives requires policies that take into 
account both objectives at all stages of policymaking (Markkanen and Anger-Kraavi 2019), including focusing on the carbon intensity 
of lifestyles (Scherer et al. 2018), attention to sufficiency and equity (Fischetti 2018), and targeting the consumption of the richest and 
highest-emitting households (Otto et al. 2019).
In modelled mitigation pathways, inequality in per-capita emissions between regions are generally reduced over time, and the 
reduction is generally more pronounced in lower-temperature pathways (Box 3.6, Figure 1). Already in 2030, if NDCs from the Paris 
Agreement, announced prior to COP26, are fully achieved, inequalities in per-capita GHG emissions between countries would be 
reduced (Benveniste et al. 2018).
The remainder of this section covers specific domains of sustainable 
development: food (Section  3.7.2), water (Section  3.7.3), energy 
(Section  3.7.4), health (Section  3.7.5), biodiversity (Section  3.7.6) 
and multi-sector  – cities, infrastructure, industry, production and 
consumption (Section  3.7.7). These represent the areas with the 
strongest research connecting mitigation to sustainable development. 
The links to individual SDGs are given within these sections. Each 
domain covers the benefits of avoided climate impacts and the 
implications (synergies and trade-offs) of mitigation efforts.
3.7.2 Food
The goal of SDG 2 is to achieve ‘zero-hunger’ by 2030. According 
to the UN (2015), over 25% of the global population currently 
experience food insecurity and nearly 40% of these experience severe 
food insecurity, a  situation worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic 
(Paslakis et al. 2021).3.7.2.1 Benefits of Avoided Climate Impacts Along 
Mitigation Pathways
Climate change will reduce crop yields, increase food insecurity, and 
negatively influence nutrition and mortality (high confidence) (AR6 
WGII Chapter 5). Climate mitigation will thus reduce these impacts, 
and hence reduce food insecurity (high confidence). The yield 
reduction of global food production will increase food insecurity and 
influence nutrition and mortality (Hasegawa et al. 2014; Springmann 
et al. 2016a). For instance, Springmann et al. (2016a) estimate that 
climate change could lead to 315,000–736,000 additional deaths by 
2050, though these could mostly be averted by stringent mitigation 
efforts. Reducing warming reduces the impacts of climate change, 
including extreme climates, on food production and risk of hunger 
(Hasegawa et al. 2014, 2021b).
3.7.2.2 Implications of Mitigation Efforts Along Pathways
Recent studies explore the effect of climate change mitigation on 
agricultural markets and food security (Havlík et al. 2014; Hasegawa 
et al. 2018; Doelman et al. 2019; Fujimori et al. 2019). Mitigation 
policies aimed at achieving  1.5°C–2°C, if not managed properly, Box 3.6 (continued)

Through avoiding impacts of climate change, which fall more heavily on low-income countries, communities and households, and 
exacerbate poverty, mitigation reduces inequalities and poverty (Section 3.6.4.2).
could negatively affect food security through changes in land and 
food prices (high confidence), leading to increases in the population 
at risk of hunger by 80–280 million people compared to baseline 
scenarios. These studies assume uniform carbon prices on AFOLU 
sectors (with some sectoral caps) and do not account for climate 
impacts on food production.
Mitigating climate change while ensuring that food security is 
not adversely affected requires a range of different strategies and 
interventions (high confidence). Fujimori et al. (2018) explore possible 
economic solutions to these unintended impacts of mitigation 
(e.g.,  agricultural subsidies, food aid, and domestic reallocation of 
income) with an additional small (<0.1%) change in global GDP . 
Targeted food-security support is needed to shield impoverished and 
vulnerable people from the risk of hunger that could be caused by the 
economic effects of policies narrowly focussed on climate objectives. 
Introducing more biofuels and careful selection of bioenergy 
feedstocks could also reduce negative impacts (FAO, IFAD, UNICEF , 
WFP and WHO, 2017). Reconciling bioenergy demands with food and 
biodiversity, as well as competition for land and water, will require 
changes in food systems  – agricultural intensification, open trade, 
less consumption of animal products and reduced food losses – and 
advanced biotechnologies (Henry et al. 2018; Xu et al. 2019).
There are many other synergistic measures for climate mitigation and 
food security. Agricultural technological innovation can improve the 
efficiency of land use and food systems, thus reducing the pressure 
on land from increasing food demand (Foley et al. 2011; Popp et al. 
2014; Obersteiner et al. 2016; Humpenöder et al. 2018; Doelman 
et al. 2019). Furthermore, decreasing consumption of animal 
products could contribute to SDG 3.4 by reducing the risk of non-
communicable diseases (Garnett 2016).
Taken together, climate changes will reduce crop yields, increase food 
insecurity and influence nutrition and mortality (high confidence) 
(see 3.7.2.1). However, if measures are not properly designed, mitigating 
climate change will also negatively impact on food consumption and 
security. Additional solutions to negative impacts associated with 
climate mitigation on food production and consumption include 
a transition to a sustainable agriculture and food system that is less 
resource intensive, more resilient to a  changing climate, and in line 
with biodiversity and social targets (Kayal et al. 2019).
3.7.3 Water
Water is relevant to SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 15 (life 
on land ), and SDG Targets 12.4 and 3.9 (water pollution and health). 
This section discusses water quantity, water quality, and water-
related extremes. See Section 3.7.5 for water-related health effects.
3.7.3.1 Benefits of Avoided Climate Impacts Along 
Mitigation Pathways
Global precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff and water availability 
increase with warming (Hanasaki et al. 2013; Greve et al. 2018) 
(AR6 WGII Chapter 4). Climate change also affects the occurrence of and exposure to hydrological extremes (high confidence) (Arnell 
and Lloyd-Hughes 2014; Asadieh and Krakauer 2017; Dottori 
et al. 2018; Naumann et al. 2018; IPCC 2019a; Do et al. 2020) (AR6 
WGII Chapter 4). Climate models project increases in precipitation 
intensity (high confidence), local flooding (medium confidence), and 
drought risk (very high confidence) (Arnell and Lloyd-Hughes 2014; 
Asadieh and Krakauer 2017; Dottori et al. 2018; IPCC 2019a) (AR6 
WGII Chapter 4).
The effect of climate change on water availability and hydrological 
extremes varies by region (high confidence) due to differences in the 
spatial patterns of projected precipitation changes (Hanasaki et al. 
2013; Schewe et al. 2014; Schlosser et al. 2014; Asadieh and Krakauer 
2017; Dottori et al. 2018; Naumann et al. 2018; Koutroulis et al. 2019) 
(AR6 WGII Chapter 4). Global exposure to water stress is projected to 
increase with increased warming, but increases will not occur in all 
regions (Hanasaki et al. 2013; Schewe et al. 2014; Arnell and Lloyd-
Hughes 2014; Gosling and Arnell 2016; IPCC 2019a).
Limiting warming could reduce water-related risks (high confidence) 
(O’Neill et al. 2017b; Byers et al. 2018; Hurlbert et al. 2019) (AR6 WGII 
Chapter  4) and the population exposed to increased water stress 
(Hanasaki et al. 2013; Arnell and Lloyd-Hughes 2014; Schewe et al. 
2014; Gosling and Arnell 2016; IPCC 2019a).
The effect of climate change on water depends on the climate model, 
the hydrological model, and the metric (high confidence) stress 
Hanasaki et al. (2013); Arnell and Lloyd-Hughes (2014); Schewe 
et al. (2014); Schlosser et al. (2014); Gosling and Arnell (2016); 
IPCC (2019a).
However, the effect of socio-economic development could be larger 
than the effect of climate change (high confidence) (Arnell and Lloyd-
Hughes 2014; Schlosser et al. 2014; Graham et al. 2020).
Climate change can also affect water quality (both thermal and 
chemical) (Liu et al. 2017), leading to increases in stream temperature 
and nitrogen loading in rivers (Ballard et al. 2019).
3.7.3.2 Implications of Mitigation Efforts Along Pathways
The effects of mitigation on water demand depends on the mitigation 
technologies deployed (high confidence) (Chaturvedi et al. 2013a,b; 
Hanasaki et al. 2013; Kyle et al. 2013; Hejazi et al. 2014; Bonsch et al. 
2016; Jakob and Steckel 2016; Mouratiadou et al. 2016; Fujimori 
et al. 2017; Maïzi et al. 2017; Bijl et al. 2018; Cui et al. 2018; Graham 
et al. 2018; Parkinson et al. 2019). Some mitigation options could 
increase water consumption (volume removed and not returned) 
while decreasing withdrawals (total volume of water removed, 
some of which may be returned) (Kyle et al. 2013; Fricko et al. 2016; 
Mouratiadou et al. 2016; Parkinson et al. 2019). Bioenergy and 
BECCS can increase water withdrawals and water consumption (high 
confidence) (Chaturvedi et al. 2013a; Kyle et al. 2013; Hejazi et al. 
2014; Bonsch et al. 2016; Jakob and Steckel 2016; Mouratiadou et al. 
2016; Fujimori et al. 2017; Maïzi et al. 2017; Séférian et al. 2018; 
Yamagata et al. 2018; Parkinson et al. 2019) (AR6 WGII Chapter 4). 
DACCS (Fuhrman et al. 2020) and CCS (Kyle et al. 2013; Fujimori 
et al. 2017) could increase water demand; however, the implications 
of CCS depend on the cooling technology and when capture occurs 
(Magneschi et al. 2017; Maïzi et al. 2017; Giannaris et al. 2020). 
Demand-side mitigation (e.g., dietary change, reduced food waste, 
reduced energy demand) can reduce water demand (Bajželj et al. 
2014; Aleksandrowicz et al. 2016; Green et al. 2018; Springmann 
et al. 2018). Introducing specific measures (e.g., environmental flow 
requirements, improved efficiency, priority rules) can reduce water 
withdrawals (Bertram et al. 2018; Bijl et al. 2018; Parkinson et al. 2019).
The effect of mitigation on water quality depends on the mitigation 
option, its implementation, and the aspect of quality considered 
(high confidence) (Ng et al. 2010; Flörke et al. 2019; Sinha et al. 
2019; Smith et al. 2019; Fuhrman et al. 2020; Karlsson et al. 2020; 
McElwee et al. 2020).
3.7.4 Energy
Energy is relevant to SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy). Access 
to sufficient levels of reliable, affordable and renewable energy is 
essential for sustainable development. Currently, over 1 billion people 
still lack access to electricity (Ribas et al. 2019).
3.7.4.1 Benefits of Avoided Climate Impacts Along 
Mitigation Pathways
Climate change alters the production of energy through changes 
in temperature (hydropower, fossil fuel, nuclear, solar, bioenergy, 
transmission and pipelines), precipitation (hydropower, fossil fuel, 
nuclear and bioenergy), windiness (wind and wave), and cloudiness 
(solar) (high confidence). Increases in temperature reduce efficiencies 
of thermal power plants (e.g.,  fossil fuel and nuclear plants) with 
air-cooled condensers by  0.4–0.7% per °C increase in ambient 
temperature (Cronin et al. 2018a; Simioni and Schaeffer 2019; 
Yalew, S.G. et al. 2020). Potentials and costs for renewable energy 
technologies are also affected by climate change, though with 
considerable regional variation and uncertainty (Gernaat et al. 2021). 
Biofuel yields could increase or decrease depending on the level of 
warming, changes in precipitation, and the effect of CO 2 fertilisation 
(Calvin et al. 2013; Kyle et al. 2014; Gernaat et al. 2021). Coastal 
energy facilities could potentially be impacted by sea level rise 
(Brown et al. 2014).
The energy sector uses large volumes of water (Fricko 
et al. 2016), making it highly vulnerable to climate change (Tan and 
Zhi 2016) (high confidence). Thermoelectric and hydropower sources 
are the most vulnerable to water stress (van Vliet et al. 2016). 
Restricted water supply to these power sources can affect grid security 
and affordable energy access (Koch et al. 2014; Ranzani et al. 2018; 
Zhang et al. 2018d).The hydropower facilities from high mountain 
areas of Central Europe, Iceland, Western USA/Canada, and Latin 
America (Hock et al. 2019), as well as Africa and China (Bartos and 
Chester 2015; Gaupp et al. 2015; Tarroja et al. 2016; Conway et al. 
2017; Byers et al. 2018; Eyer and Wichman 2018; Ranzani et al. 2018; 
Savelsberg et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2018d; Zhou et al. 2018; Wang 
et al. 2019) have experienced changes in seasonality and availability.3.7.4.2 Implications of Mitigation Efforts Along Pathways
Extending energy access to all in line with SDG7 is compatible 
with strong mitigation consistent with the Paris Agreement (high 
confidence). The Low Energy Demand (LED) scenario projects that 
these twin goals can be achieved by relying heavily on energy 
efficiency and rapid social transformations (Grubler et al. 2018). 
The IEA’s Sustainable Development Scenario (IEA 2020a) achieves 
development outcomes but with higher average energy use, and 
bottom-up modelling suggests that decent living standards could be 
provided to all in 2040–2050 with roughly 150 EJ, or 40% of current 
final energy use (Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020; Kikstra et al. 2021b). 
The trade-offs between climate mitigation and increasing energy 
consumption of the world’s poorest are negligible (Rao and Min 
2018; Scherer et al. 2018).
The additional energy demand to meet the basic cooling requirement 
in the Global South is estimated to be much larger than the 
electricity needed to provide basic residential energy services 
universally via clean and affordable energy, as defined by SDG 7 (IEA 
2019; Mastrucci et al. 2019) (high confidence). If conventional air-
conditioning systems are widely deployed to provide cooling, energy 
use could rise significantly (van Ruijven et al. 2019; Bezerra et al. 
2021; Falchetta and Mistry 2021), thus creating a positive feedback 
further increasing cooling demand. However, the overall emissions 
are barely altered by the changing energy demand composition with 
reductions in heating demand occurring simultaneously (Isaac and 
van Vuuren 2009; Labriet et al. 2015; McFarland et al. 2015; Clarke 
et al. 2018). Some mitigation scenarios show price increases of clean 
cooking fuels, slowing the transition to clean cooking fuels (SDG 7.1) 
and leaving a billion people in 2050 still reliant on solid fuels in South 
Asia (Cameron et al. 2016).
In contrast, future energy infrastructure could improve reliability, thus 
lowering dependence on high-carbon, high-air pollution back-up diesel 
generators (Farquharson et al. 2018) that are often used to cope with 
unreliable power in developing countries (Maruyama Rentschler et al. 
2019). There can be significant reliability issues where mini-grids are 
used to electrify rural areas (Numminen and Lund 2019). A  stable, 
sustainable energy transition policy that considers national sustainable 
development in the short and long term is critical in driving a transition 
to an energy future that addresses the trilemma of energy security, 
equity, and sustainability (La Viña et al. 2018).
3.7.5 Health
SDG 3 (good health and well-being) aims to ensure healthy lives and 
promote well-being for all at all ages. Climate change is increasingly 
causing injuries, illnesses, malnutrition, threats to mental health 
and well-being, and deaths (AR6 WGII Chapter 7). Mitigation policies 
and technologies to reduce GHG emissions are often beneficial 
for human health on a  shorter time scale than benefits in terms 
of slowing climate change (Limaye et al. 2020). The financial value 
of health benefits from improved air quality alone is projected to 
exceed the costs of meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement 
(Markandya et al. 2018).
3.7.5.1 Benefits of Avoided Climate Impacts Along 
Mitigation Pathways
The human health chapter of the WGII contribution to the AR6 
concluded that climate change is increasingly affecting a  growing 
number of health outcomes, with negative net impacts at the global 
scale and positive impacts only in a few limited situations. There are 
few estimates of economic costs of increases in climate-sensitive 
health outcomes. In the USA in 2012, the financial burden in terms 
of deaths, hospitalisations, and emergency department visits for 
ten climate-sensitive events across 11 states were estimated to be 

3.7.5.2 Implications of Mitigation Efforts Along Pathways
Transitioning toward equitable, low-carbon societies has multiple 
co-benefits for health and well-being (AR6 WGII Chapter 7). Health 
benefits can be gained from improvements in air quality through 
transitioning to renewable energy and active transport (e.g., walking 
and cycling); shifting to affordable low-meat, plant-rich diets; and 
green buildings and nature-based solutions, such as green-and-blue 
urban infrastructure, as shown in Figure 3.40 (Iacobucci 2016).The avoided health impacts associated with climate change mitigation 
can substantially offset mitigation costs at the societal level (Ščasný 
et al. 2015; Schucht et al. 2015; Chang et al. 2017; Markandya et al. 
2018). Models of health co-benefits show that a 1.5°C pathway could 
result in 152 million ± 43 million fewer premature deaths worldwide 
between 2020 and 2100 in comparison to a  business-as-usual 
scenario, particularly due to reductions in exposure to PM2.5 (Shindell 
et al. 2018; Rauner et al. 2020a; Rafaj et al. 2021). Some of the most 
substantial health, well-being, and equity benefits associated with 
climate action derive from investing in basic infrastructure: sanitation, 
clean drinking water, clean energy, affordable healthy diets, clean 
public transport, and improved air quality from transformative 
solutions across economic sectors including agriculture, energy, 
transport and buildings (Chang et al. 2017).
The health co-benefits of the NDCs for 2040 were compared for 
two scenarios, one consistent with the goal of the Paris Agreement 
and the SDGs and the other also placing health as a  central focus 
of the policies (i.e., health in all climate policies scenario) (Hamilton 
et al. 2021), for Brazil, China, Germany, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, 
South Africa, the UK, and the USA. Modelling of the energy, food 
and agriculture, and transport sectors, and associated risk factors

related to mortality, suggested the sustainable pathways scenario 
could result in annual reductions of 1.18 million air pollution-related 
deaths, 5.86 million diet-related deaths, and 1.15 million deaths due to 
physical inactivity. Adopting the more ambitious health in all climate 
policies scenario could result in further reductions of 462,000 annual 
deaths attributable to air pollution, 572,000 annual deaths attributable 
to diet, and 943,000 annual deaths attributable to physical inactivity. 
These benefits were attributable to the mitigation of direct GHG 
emissions and the commensurate actions that reduce exposure to 
harmful pollutants, as well as improved diets and safe physical activity.
Cost-benefit analyses for climate mitigation in urban settings that do 
not account for health may underestimate the potential cost savings 
and benefits (Hess et al. 2020). The net health benefits of controlling 
air pollution as part of climate mitigation efforts could reach trillions 
of dollars annually, depending on the air quality policies adopted 
globally (Markandya et al. 2018; Scovronick et al. 2019b). Air pollution 
reductions resulting from meeting the Paris Agreement targets 
were estimated to provide health co-benefits-to-mitigation ratios 
of between 1.4 and 2.5 (Markandya et al. 2018). In Asia, the benefit of 
air pollution reduction through mitigation measures was estimated to 
reduce premature mortality by 0.79 million, with an associated health 
benefit of USD2.8 trillion versus mitigation costs of USD840 billion, 
equating to 6% and 2% of GDP , respectively (Xie et al. 2018). Similarly, 
stabilising radiative forcing to  3.4 W  m–2 in South Korea could 
cost USD1.3–8.5 billion in 2050 and could lead to a USD23.5 billion 
cost reduction from the combined benefits of avoided premature 
mortality, health expenditures, and lost work hours (Kim et al. 2020). 
The health co-benefits related to physical exercise and reduced air 
pollution largely offset the costs of implementing low-CO 2-emitting 
urban mobility strategies in three Austrian cities (Wolkinger et al. 2018).
Just in the USA, over the next 50 years, a  2°C pathway could 
prevent roughly  4.5 million premature deaths, about  3.5 million 
hospitalisations and emergency room visits, and approximately 

benefits of USD700 billion were more than the estimated cost of the 
energy transition.
3.7.6 Biodiversity (Land and Water)
Biodiversity covers life below water (SDG 14) and life on land 
(SDG  15). Ecosystem services are relevant to the goals of zero 
hunger (SDG 2), good health and well-being (SDG 3), clean water 
and sanitation (SDG 6) and responsible consumption and production 
(SDG 12), as well as being essential to human existence (IPBES 2019).
3.7.6.1 Benefits of Avoided Climate Impacts Along 
Mitigation Pathways
Terrestrial and freshwater aquatic ecosystems
Climate change is a major driver of species extinction and terrestrial 
and freshwater ecosystems destruction (high confidence) (AR6 WGII 
Chapter 2). Analysis shows that approximately half of all species with 
long-term records have shifted their ranges in elevation and about two thirds have advanced their timing of spring events (Parmesan and 
Hanley 2015). Under 3.2°C warming, 49% of insects, 44% of plants 
and 26% of vertebrates are projected to be at risk of extinction. At  
2°C, this falls to 18% of insects, 16% of plants  and  8%  of  vertebrates  and 
at 1.5°C, to 6% of insects, 8% of plants and 4% of vertebrates (Warren 
et al. 2018). Incidents of migration of invasive species, including pests 
and diseases, are also attributable to climate change, with negative 
impacts on food security and vector-borne diseases. Moreover, if 
climate change reduces crop yields, cropland may expand – a primary 
driver of biodiversity loss – in order to meet food demand (Molotoks 
et al. 2020). Land restoration and halting land degradation under all 
mitigation scenarios has the potential for synergy between mitigation 
and adaptation.
Marine and coastal ecosystems
Marine ecosystems are being affected by climate change and growing 
non-climate pressures including temperature change, acidification, 
land-sourced pollution, sedimentation, resource extraction and 
habitat destruction (high confidence) (Bindoff et al. 2019; IPCC 2019b). 
The impacts of climate drivers and their combinations vary across 
taxa (AR6 WGII Chapter 3). The danger or warming and acidification 
to coral reefs, rocky shores and kelp forests is well established 
(high confidence) (AR6 WGII Chapter 3). Migration towards optimal 
thermal and chemical conditions (Burrows et al. 2019) contributes to 
large-scale redistribution of fish and invertebrate populations, and 
major impacts on global marine biomass production and maximum 
sustainable yield (Bindoff et al. 2019).
3.7.6.2 Implications of Mitigation Efforts Along Pathways
Mitigation measures have the potential to reduce the progress 
of negative impacts on ecosystems, although it is unlikely that all 
impacts can be mitigated (high confidence) (Ohashi et al. 2019). 
The specifics of mitigation achievement are crucial, since large-
scale deployment of some climate mitigation and land-based CDR 
measures could have deleterious impacts on biodiversity (Santangeli 
et al. 2016; Hof et al. 2018).
Climate change mitigation actions to reduce or slow negative impacts 
on ecosystems are likely to support the achievement of SDGs 2, 3, 6, 
12, 14 and 15. Some studies show that stringent and constant GHG 
mitigation practices bring a net benefit to global biodiversity even 
if land-based mitigation measures are also adopted (Ohashi et al. 
2019), as opposed to delayed action which would require much more 
widespread use of BECCS. Scenarios based on demand reductions 
of energy and land-based production are expected to avoid many 
such consequences, due to their minimised reliance on BECCS (Conijn 
et al. 2018; Grubler et al. 2018;  Bowles et al. 2019; Soergel et al. 
2021a). Stringent mitigation that includes reductions in demand for 
animal-based foods and food waste could also relieve pressures on 
land use and biodiversity (high confidence), both directly by reducing 
agricultural land requirements (Leclère et al. 2020) and indirectly by 
reducing the need for land-based CDR (van Vuuren et al. 2018).
As environmental conservation and sustainable use of the Earth’s 
terrestrial species and ecosystems are strongly related, recent studies 
have evaluated interconnections among key aspects of land and show 
a pathway to the global sustainable future of land (Popp et al. 2014; 
Erb et al. 2016; Obersteiner et al. 2016; Humpenöder et al. 2018). Most 
studies agree that many biophysical options exist to achieve global 
climate mitigation and sustainable land use in future. Conserving 
local biodiversity requires careful policy design in conjunction with 
land-use regulations and societal transformation in order to minimise 
the conversion of natural habitats.
3.7.7 Cities and Infrastructure
This subsection focuses upon SDG 9 (industry, innovation and 
infrastructure) and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities).
3.7.7.1 Benefits of Avoided Climate Impacts Along 
Mitigation Pathways
By 2100, urban population will be almost double and more urban 
areas will be built (Jiang and O’Neill 2017), although COVID-19 may 
modify these trends (Kii 2021). Urbanisation will amplify projected air 
temperature changes in cities, including amplifying heatwaves (AR6 
WGI Chapter 10, Box 10.3). Benefits of climate mitigation in urban 
areas include reducing heat, air pollution and flooding. Industrial 
infrastructure and production-consumption supply networks also 
benefit from avoided impacts.
3.7.7.2 Implications of Mitigation Efforts Along Pathways
Many co-benefits to urban mitigation actions (Chapter  8, 
Section  8.2.1) improve the liveability of cities and contribute to 
achieving SDG 11. In particular, compact urban form, efficient 
technologies and infrastructure can play a valuable role in mitigation 
by reducing energy demand (Creutzig et al. 2016; Güneralp et al. 
2017), thus averting carbon lock-in, while reducing land sprawl and 
hence increasing carbon storage and biodiversity (D’Amour et al. 
2017). Benefits of mitigation include air quality improvements from 
decreased traffic and congestion when private vehicles are displaced 
by other modes; health benefits from increases in active travel; and 
lowered urban heat island effects from green-blue infrastructures 
(Section 8.2.1).
However, increasing urban density or enlarging urban green spaces 
can increase property prices and reduce affordability (Section 8.2.1). 
Raising living conditions for slum dwellers and people living in 
informal settlements will require significant materials and energy; 
however, regeneration can be conducted in ways that avoid carbon-
intense infrastructure lock-in (Chapters 8 and 9). Cities affect other 
regions through supply chains (Marinova et al. 2020).
Sustainable production, consumption and management of natural 
resources are consistent with, and necessary for, mitigation 
(Chapters 5 and 11). Demand-side measures can lower requirements 
for upstream material and energy use (Chapter  5). In terms of 
industrial production, transformational changes across sectors will 
be necessary for mitigation (Sections 11.3 and 11.4).Addressing multiple SDG arenas requires new systemic thinking 
in the areas of governance and policy, such as those proposed by 
Sachs et al. (2019).
3.8 Feasibility of Socio/Techno/Economic 
Transitions
The objective of this section is to discuss concepts of feasibility in 
the context of the low-carbon transition and pathways. We aim to 
identify drivers of low-carbon scenarios feasibility and to highlight 
enabling conditions which can ameliorate feasibility concerns.
3.8.1 Feasibility Frameworks for the Low-carbon 
Transition and Scenarios
Effectively responding to climate change and achieving sustainable 
development requires overcoming a series of challenges to transition 
away from fossil-based economies. Feasibility can be defined in many 
ways (Chapter 1). The political science literature (Majone 1975a,b; 
Gilabert and Lawford-Smith 2012) distinguishes the feasibility of 
‘what’ (i.e., emission reduction strategies), ‘when and where’ (i.e., in 
the year 2050, globally) and ‘whom’ (i.e.,  cities). It distinguishes 
desirability from political feasibility (von Stechow et al. 2015): the 
former represents a normative assessment of the compatibility with 
societal goals (i.e., SDGs), while the latter evaluates the plausibility of 
what can be attained given the prevailing context of transformation 
(Nielsen et al. 2020). Feasibility concerns are context and time 
dependent and malleable: enabling conditions can help overcome 
them. For example, public support for carbon taxes has been hard to 
secure but appropriate policy design and household rebates can help 
dissipate opposition (Murray and Rivers 2015; Carattini et al. 2019).
Regarding scenarios, the feasibility ‘what’ question is the one most 
commonly dealt with in the literature, though most of the studies 
have focused on expanding low-carbon system, and yet political 
constraints might arise mostly from phasing out fossil fuel-based 
ones (Spencer et al. 2018; Fattouh et al. 2019). The ‘when and where’ 
dimension can also be related to the scenario assessment, but only 
insofar that the models generating them can differentiate time and 
geographical contextual factors. Distinguishing mitigation potential 
by regional institutional capacity has a significant influence on the 
costs of stabilising climate (Iyer et al. 2015c). The ‘whom’ question 
is the most difficult to capture by scenarios, given the multitude 
of actors involved as well as their complex interactions. The focus of 
socio-technical transition sciences on the co-evolutionary processes 
can shed light on the dynamics of feasibility (Nielsen et al. 2020).
The when-where-whom distinction allows depicting a  feasibility 
frontier beyond which implementation challenges prevent mitigation 
action (Jewell and Cherp 2020). Even if the current feasibility frontier 
appears restraining in some jurisdictions, it is context-dependent and 
dynamic as innovation proceeds and institutional capacity builds up 
(Nielsen et al. 2020). The question is whether the feasibility frontier 
can move faster than the pace at which the carbon budget is being 
exhausted. Jewell et al. (2019) show that the emission savings from 
the pledges of premature retirement of coal plants is 150 times less 
than globally committed emissions from existing coal power plants. 
The pledges come from countries with high institutional capacity 
and relatively low shares of coal in electricity. Other factors currently 
limiting the capacity to steer transitions at the necessary speed 
include the electoral-market orientation of politicians (Willis 2017), 
the status-quo orientation of senior public officials (Geden 2016), 
path dependencies created by ‘instrument constituencies’ (Béland 
and Howlett 2016), or the impacts of deliberate inconsistencies 
between talk, decisions and actions in climate policy (Rickards et al. 
2014). All in all, a  number of different delay mechanisms in both 
science and policy have been identified to potentially impede climate 
goal achievement (Karlsson and Gilek 2020) (Chapter 13).
In addition to its contextual and dynamic nature, feasibility is a multi-
dimensional concept. The IPCC SR1.5 distinguishes six dimensions 
of feasibility: geophysical, environmental-ecological, technological, 
economic, socio-cultural and institutional. At the individual option 
level, different mitigation strategies face various barriers as well as 
enablers (see Chapter 6 for the option-level assessment). However, 
a systemic transformation involves interconnections of a wide range 
of indicators. Model-based assessments are meant to capture the 
integrative elements of the transition and of associated feasibility 
challenges. However, the translation of model-generated pathways 
into feasibility concerns (Rogelj et al. 2018b) has developed 
only recently. Furthermore, multiple forms of knowledge can be 
mobilised to support strategic decision-making and complement 
scenario analysis (Turnheim and Nykvist 2019). We discuss both 
approaches next.
3.8.2 Feasibility Appraisal of Low-carbon Scenarios
Evaluating the feasibility of low-carbon pathways can take different 
forms. In the narrowest sense, there is feasibility pertaining the 
reporting of model-generated scenarios: here an infeasible scenario 
is one which cannot meet the constraints embedded implicitly or 
explicitly in the models which attempted to generate it. Second, 
there is a  feasibility that relates to specific elements or overall 
structure characterising the low-carbon transition compared to some 
specified benchmark.
3.8.2.1  Model Solvability
In order to be generated, scenarios must be coherent with 
the constraints and assumptions embedded in the models 
(i.e.,  deployment potential of given technologies, physical and 
geological limits) and in the scenario design (i.e.,  carbon budget). 
Sometimes, models cannot solve specific scenarios. This provides 
a  first, coarse indication of feasibility concerns. Specific vetting 
criteria can be imposed, such as carbon-price values above which 
scenarios should not be reported, as in Clarke et al. (2009). However, 
model solvability raises issues of aggregation in model ensembles. 
Since model solving is not a random process, but a function of the 
characteristics of the models, analysing only reported outcomes leads 
to statistical biases (Tavoni and Tol 2010).Although model-feasibility differs distinctly from feasibility in the 
real world, it can indicate the relative challenges of low-carbon 
scenarios  – primarily when performed in a  model ensemble of 
sufficient size. Riahi et al. (2015) interpreted infeasibility across 
a large number of models as an indication of increased risk that the 
transformation may not be attainable due to technical or economic 
concerns. All models involved in a model comparison of 1.5°C targets 
(Rogelj et al. 2018b) (Table S1) were able to solve under favourable 
underlying socio-economic assumptions (SSP1), but none for the 
more challenging SSP3. This interpretation of feasibility was used 
to highlight the importance of socio-economic drivers for attaining 
climate stabilisation. Gambhir et al. (2017) constrained the models 
to historically observed rates of change and found that it would 
no longer allow to solve for 2°C, highlighting the need for rapid 
technological change.
3.8.2.2 Scenario Feasibility
Evaluating the feasibility of scenarios involves several steps 
(Figure  3.41). First, one needs to identify which dimensions of 
feasibility to focus on. Then, for each dimension, one needs to 
select relevant indicators for which sufficient empirical basis exists 
and which are an output of models (or at least of a  sufficient 
number of them). Then, thresholds marking different levels of 
feasibility concerns are defined based on available literature, 
expert elicitations and empirical analysis based on appropriately 
chosen historical precedents. Finally, scenario feasibility scores are 
obtained for each indicator, and where needed aggregated up in 
time or dimensions, as a  way to provide an overall appraisal of 
feasibility trade-offs, depending on the timing, disruptiveness and 
scale of transformation.
Most of the existing literature has focused on the technological 
dimensions, given the technology focus of models and the ease of 
comparison. The literature points to varied findings. Some suggest that 
scenarios envision technological progress consistent with historical 
benchmarks (Wilson et al. 2013; Loftus  et al. 2015). Others that 
scenarios exceed historically observed rates of low-carbon technology 
deployment and of energy demand transformation globally (van der 
Zwaan et al. 2013; Napp et al. 2017; Cherp et al. 2021; Semieniuk 
et al. 2021), but not for all countries (Cherp et al. 2021). The reason for 
these discrepancies depends on the unit of analysis and the indicators 
used. Comparing  different kinds of historical indicators, (van Sluisveld 
et al. 2015) find that indicators that look into the absolute change of 
energy systems remain within the range of historical growth frontiers 
for the next decade, but increase to unprecedented levels before mid-
century. Expert assessments provide another way of benchmarking 
scenarios, though they have shown to be systematically biased 
(Wiser et al. 2021) and to underperform empirical methods (Meng 
et al. 2021). van Sluisveld et al. (2018a) find that scenarios and 
experts align for baseline scenarios but differ for low-carbon ones. 
Scenarios rely more on conventional technologies based on existing 
infrastructure (such as nuclear and CCS) than what is forecasted by 
experts. Overall, the technology assessment of the feasibility space 
highlights that Paris-compliant transformations would have few 
precedents, but not zero (Cherp et al. 2021).

Figure 3.43 | Feasibility characteristics of the Paris-consistent scenarios in the AR6 scenarios database : Feasibility corridors for the AR6 scenarios 
database, applying the methodology by (Brutschin et al.  2021).  (a) The fraction of scenarios falling within three categories of feasibility concerns (plausible, best case, 
unprecedented), for different times (2030, 2050, 2100), different climate categories consistent with the Paris Agreement and five dimensions. (b) Composite feasibility score 
(obtained by geometric mean of underlying indicators) over time for scenarios with immediate and delayed global mitigation efforts, for different climate categories (C1, C2, C3. 
Note: no C1 scenario has delayed participation). (c) The fraction of scenarios which in any point in time over the century exceed the feasibility concerns, for C1 and C3 climate 
categories. Overlayed are the Illustrative Mitigation Pathways (IMP-LP, IMP-SP, IMP-Ren: C1 category; IMP-Neg, IMP-GS: C3 category).
Recent approaches have addressed multiple dimensions of feasibility, 
an important advancement since social and institutional aspects 
are as, if not more, important than technology ones (Jewell and 
Cherp 2020). Feasibility corridors of scenarios based on their scale, 
rate of change and disruptiveness have been identified (Kriegler 
et al. 2018b; Warszawski et al. 2021). The reality check shows that 
many  1.5°C-compatible scenarios violate the feasibility corridors. 
The ones that didn’t are associated with a greater coverage of the 
available mitigation levers (Warszawski et al. 2021).
Brutschin et al. (2021) proposed an operational framework covering 
all six dimensions of feasibility. They developed a  set of multi-
dimensional metrics capturing the timing, disruptiveness and the scale 
of the transformative change within each dimension (as in Kriegler 
et al. 2018b). Thresholds of feasibility risks of different intensity are 
obtained through the review of the relevant literature and empirical 
analysis of historical data. Novel indicators include governance 
levels (Andrijevic et al. 2020a). The 17 bottom-up indicators are then 
aggregated up across time and dimension, as a  way to highlight 
feasibility trade-offs. Aggregation is done via compensatory 
approaches such as the geometric mean. This is employed, for 
instance, for the Human Development Index. A conceptual example 
of this approach as applied to the IPCC AR6 scenarios database is 
shown in Figure 3.42 and further described in the Annex III.II.2.3.
In Figure  3.43, we show the results of applying the methodology 
of Brutschin et al. (2021) to the AR6 scenarios database. The 
charts highlight the dynamic nature of feasibility risks, which are 
mostly concentrated in the decades before mid-century except 
for geophysical risks driven by CO 2 removals later in the century. 
Different dimensions pose differentiated challenges: for example, 
institutional feasibility challenges appear to be the most relevant, in 
line with the qualitative literature. Thus, feasibility concerns might be 
particularly relevant in countries with weaker institutional capacity. 
Figure 3.43 also highlights the key roles of policy and technology as 
enabling factors. In particular (panel b), internationally coordinated 
and immediate emission reductions allow to smooth out feasibility 
concerns and reduce long-term challenges compared to delayed 
policy action, as a  result of a  more gradual transition and lower 
requirements of CO 2 removals. For the same climate objective, 
different Illustrative Mitigation Pathways entail somewhat different 
degrees and distributions of implementation challenges (panel c).
3.8.3 Feasibility in Light of Socio-technical Transitions
The limitations associated with quantitative low-carbon transition 
pathways stem from a  predominant reliance on techno-economic 
considerations with a  simplified or non-existent representation 
of the socio-political and institutional agreement. Accompanying 
the required deployment of low-carbon technologies will be the 
formation of new socio-technical systems (Bergek et al. 2008). With 
a  socio-technical system being defined as a  cluster of elements 
comprising of technology, regulation, user practices and markets, 
cultural meaning, infrastructure, maintenance networks, and supply 
networks (Hofman et al. 2004; Geels and Geels 2005); the inter-
relationship between technological systems and social systems must be comprehensively understood. It is of vital importance that the 
process of technical change must be considered in its institutional 
and social context so as to ascertain potential transition barriers 
which in turn provide an indication of pathway feasibility. In order 
to address the multitudinous challenges associated with low-
carbon transition feasibility and governance, it has been opined 
that the robustness of evaluating pathways may be improved by the 
bridging of differing quantitative-qualitative analytical approaches 
(Haxeltine et al. 2008; Foxon et al. 2010; Hughes 2013; Wangel et al. 
2013; Li et al. 2015; Turnheim et al. 2015; Geels et al. 2016a,b, 2020; 
Moallemi et al. 2017; De Cian et al. 2020; Li and Strachan 2019). The 
rationale for such analytical bridging is to rectify the issue that in 
isolation each disciplinary approach can only generate a fragmented 
comprehension of the transition pathway with the consequence 
being an incomplete identification of associated challenges in terms 
of feasibility. Concerning low-carbon transition pathways generated 
by IAMs, it has been argued that a comprehensive analysis should 
include social scientific enquiry (Geels et al. 2016a, 2020; van Sluisveld 
et al. 2018b). The normative analysis of IAM pathways assists in the 
generation of a vision or the formulation of a general plan with this 
being complemented by socio-technical transition theory (Geels et al. 
2016a). Such an approach thereby allowing for the socio-political 
feasibility and the social acceptance and legitimacy of low-carbon 
options to be considered. Combining computer models and the multi-
level perspective can help identify ‘transition bottlenecks’ (Geels 
et al. 2020). Similarly, increased resolution of integrated assessment 
models’ actors has led to more realistic narratives of transition in terms 
of granularity and behaviour (McCollum et al. 2017; van  Sluisveld 
et al. 2018b). Increased data availability of actual behaviour from 
smart technology lowers the barriers to representing behavioural 
change in computer simulations, and thus better represents crucial 
demand-side transformations (Creutzig et al. 2018). Increasing the 
model resolution is a meaningful way forward. However, integrating 
a much broader combination of real-life aspects and dynamics into 
models could lead to an increased complexity that could restrict them 
to smaller fields of applications (De Cian et al. 2020).
Other elements of feasibility relate to social justice, which could be 
essential to enhance the political and public acceptability of the 
low-carbon transition. Reviewing the literature, one study finds that 
employing social justice as an orienting principle can increase the 
political feasibility of low-carbon policies (Patterson et al. 2018). 
Three elements are identified as key: (i) protecting vulnerable people 
from climate change impacts, (ii) protecting people from disruptions 
of transformation, (iii) enhancing the process of envisioning and 
implementing an equitable post-carbon society.
3.8.4 Enabling Factors
There is strong agreement that the climate policy institutional 
framework as well as technological progress have a profound impact 
on the attainability of low-carbon pathways. Delaying international 
cooperation reduces the available carbon budget and locks into 
carbon-intensive infrastructure exacerbating implementation 
challenges (Keppo and Rao 2007; Bosetti et al. 2009; Boucher et al. 
2009; Clarke et al. 2009; Krey and Riahi 2009; van Vliet et al. 2009; 
Knopf et al. 2011; Jakob et al. 2012; Luderer et al. 2013; Rogelj 
et al. 2013a; Aboumahboub et al. 2014; Kriegler et al. 2014a; Popp 
et al. 2014; Riahi et al. 2015; Gambhir et al. 2017; Bertram et al. 
2021). Similarly, technological availability influences the feasibility 
of climate stabilisation, though differently for different technologies 
(Kriegler et al. 2014a; Iyer et al. 2015a; Riahi et al. 2015).
One of the most relevant factors affecting mitigation pathways and 
their feasibility is the rate and kind of socio-economic development. 
For example, certain socio-economic trends and assumptions 
about  policy effectiveness preclude achieving stringent mitigation 
futures (Rogelj et al. 2018b). The risk of failure increases markedly 
in high-growth, unequal and/or  energy-intensive worlds such as 
those characterised by the shared socio-economic pathways SSP3, 
SSP4 and SSP5. On the other hand, socio-economic development 
conducive to mitigation relieves the energy sector transformation 
from relying on large-scale technology development: for example, 
the amount of biomass with CCS in SSP1 is one third of that in SSP5. 
The reason why socio-economic trends matter so much is that they 
both affect the CO 2 emissions in counterfactual scenarios as well 
as the mitigation capacity (Riahi et al. 2017; Rogelj et al. 2018b). 
Economic growth assumptions are the most important determinant 
of scenario emissions (Marangoni et al. 2017). Degrowth and post-
growth scenarios have been suggested as valuable alternatives to 
be considered (Hickel et al. 2021; Keyßer and Lenzen 2021), though 
substantial challenges remain regarding political feasibility (Keyßer 
and Lenzen 2021).
The type of policy instrument assumed to drive the decarbonisation 
process also plays a vital role for determining feasibility. The majority 
of scenarios exploring climate stabilisation pathways in the past have 
focused on uniform carbon pricing as the most efficient instrument 
to regulate emissions. However, carbon taxation raises political 
challenges (Beiser-McGrath and Bernauer 2019) (Chapters  13 and 
14). Carbon pricing will transfer economic surplus from consumers 
and producers to the government. Losses for producers will be highly 
concentrated in those industries possessing fixed or durable assets 
with ‘high asset specificity’ (Murphy 2002; Dolphin et al. 2020). These 
sectors have opposed climate jurisdictions (Jenkins 2014). Citizens 
are sensitive to rising energy prices, though revenue recycling can 
be used to increase support (Carattini et al. 2019). A recent model 
comparison project confirms findings from the extant literature: 
using revenues to reduce pre-existing capital or, to a lesser extent, 
labour taxes, reduces policy costs and eases distributional concerns 
(Barron et al. 2018; Mcfarland et al. 2018).
Nonetheless, winning support will require a mix of policies which go 
beyond carbon pricing, and include subsidies, mandates and feebates 
(Jenkins 2014; Rozenberg et al. 2018). More recent scenarios take 
into account a more comprehensive range of policies and regional 
heterogeneity in the near to medium term (Roelfsema et al. 2020). 
Regulatory policies complementing carbon prices could reduce 
the implementation challenges by increasing short-term emission 
reduction, though they could eventually reduce economic efficiency 
(Bertram et al. 2015b; Kriegler et al. 2018a). Innovation policies 
such as subsidies to R&D have been shown to be desirable due to innovation market failures, and also address the dynamic nature of 
political feasibility (Bosetti et al. 2011).
3.9 Methods of Assessment and Gaps 
in Knowledge and Data
3.9.1 AR6 Mitigation Pathways
The analysis in this chapter relies on the available literature as well 
as an assessment of the scenarios contained in the AR6 scenarios 
database. Scenarios were submitted by research and other institutions 
following an open call (Annex III.II.3.1). The scenarios included in the 
AR6 scenarios database are an unstructured ensemble, as they are 
from multiple underlying studies and depend on which institutions 
chose to submit scenarios to the database. As noted in Section 3.2, 
they do not represent the full scenario literature or the complete set 
of possible scenarios. For example, scenarios that include climate 
change impacts or economic degrowth are not fully represented, 
as these scenarios, with a  few exceptions, were not submitted 
to the database. Additionally, sensitivity studies, which could 
help elucidate model behaviour and drivers of change, are mostly 
absent from the database – though examples exist in the literature 
(Marangoni et al. 2017).
The AR6 scenarios database contains 3131 scenarios of which 

by almost 100 different model versions, from more than 50 model 
families. Of the 1686 vetted scenarios, 1202 provided sufficient 
information for a climate categorisation. Around 46% of the pathways 
are consistent with an end-of-century temperature of at least likely 
limiting warming to below 2°C (>67%). There are many ways of 
constructing scenarios that limit warming to a particular level and 
the choice of scenario construction has implications for the timing of 
both net zero CO 2 and GHG emissions and the deployment of CDR 
(Emmerling et al. 2019; Rogelj et al. 2019b; Johansson et al. 2020). 
The AR6 scenarios database includes scenarios where temperature 
is temporarily exceeded (40% of all scenarios in the database 
have median temperature in 2100 that is 0.1°C lower than median 
peak temperature). Climate stabilisation scenarios are typically 
implemented by assuming a carbon price rising at a particular rate 
per year, though that rate varies across model, scenario, and time 
period. Standard scenarios assume a  global single carbon price to 
minimise policy costs. Cost-minimising pathways can be reconciled 
with equity considerations through posterior international transfers. 
Many scenarios extrapolate current policies and include non-market, 
regulatory instruments such as technology mandates.
Scenarios are not independent of each other and not representative 
of all possible outcomes, nor of the underlying scenario generation 
process; thus, the statistical power of the database is limited. 
Dependencies in the data-generation process originate from various 
sources. Certain model groups, and types, are over-represented. For 
example, eight model teams contributed 90% of scenarios. Second, 
not all models can generate all scenarios, and these differences are 
not random, thereby creating selection bias (Tavoni and Tol 2010). 
Third, there are strong model dependencies: the modelling scientific 
community shares code and data, and several IAMs are open-source. 
3.9.2 Models Assessed in This Chapter
The models assessed in this chapter differ in their sectoral coverage 
and the level of complexity in each sector. Models tend to have more 
detail in their representation of energy supply and transportation, 
than they do for industry (Section 3.4 and Annex III.I). Some models 
include detailed land-use models, while others exclude land models 
entirely and use supply curves to represent bioenergy potential 
(Bauer et al. 2018a). IAMs do not include all mitigation options 
available in the literature (Rogelj et al. 2018b; Smith et al. 2019). 
For example, most IAM pathways exclude many granular demand-
side mitigation options and land-based mitigation options found in 
more detailed sectoral models; additionally, only a  few pathways 
include CDR options beyond afforestation/reforestation and BECCS. 
Section 3.4 and Chapter 12 include some results and comparisons 
to non-IAM models (e.g.,  bottom-up studies and detailed sectoral 
models). These sectoral studies often include a  more complete set 
of mitigation options but exclude feedbacks and linkages across 
sectors which may alter the mitigation potential of a given sector. 
There is an increasing focus in IAM studies on SDGs (Section 3.7), 
with some studies reporting the implications of mitigation pathways 
on SDGs (e.g.,  Bennich et al. 2020) and others using achieving 
SDGs as a constraint on the scenario itself (van Vuuren et al. 2015; 
Soergel et al. 2021a). However, IAMs are still limited in the SDGs they 
represent, often focusing on energy, water, air pollution and land. 
On the economic side, the majority of the models report information 
on marginal costs (i.e.,  carbon price). Only a  subset provides full 
economic implications measured by either economic activity or 
welfare. Also often missing, is detail about economic inequality 
within countries or large aggregate regions.
For further details about the models and scenarios, see Annex III.
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
FAQ 3.1 |  Is it possible to stabilise warming without net negative CO 2 and GHG emissions?
Yes. Achieving net zero CO 2 emissions and sustaining them into the future is sufficient to stabilise the CO 2-induced warming signal 
which scales with the cumulative net amount of CO 2 emissions. At the same time, the warming signal of non-CO 2 GHGs can be 
stabilised or reduced by declining emissions that lead to stable or slightly declining concentrations in the atmosphere. For short-lived 
GHGs with atmospheric lifetimes of less than 20 years, this is achieved when residual emissions are reduced to levels that are lower 
than the natural removal of these gases in the atmosphere. Taken together, mitigation pathways that bring CO 2 emissions to net 
zero and sustain it, while strongly reducing non-CO 2 GHGs to levels that stabilise or decline their aggregate warming contribution, 
will stabilise warming without using net negative CO 2 emissions and with positive overall GHG emissions when aggregated using 
GWP-100. A considerable fraction of pathways that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot and limit warming 
to 2°C (>67%), respectively, do not or only marginally (<10 GtCO 2 cumulative until 2100) deploy net negative CO 2 emissions (26% 
and 46%, respectively) and do not reach net zero GHG emissions by the end of the century (48% and 70%, respectively). This is no 
longer the case in pathways that return warming to 1.5°C (>50%) after a high overshoot (typically >0.1°C). All of these pathways 
deploy net negative emissions on the order of 360 (60–680) GtCO 2 (median and 5–95th percentile) and 87% achieve net negative 
GHGs emissions in AR6 GWP-100 before the end of the century. Hence, global net negative CO 2 emissions, and net zero or net 
negative GHG emissions, are only needed to decline, not to stabilise global warming. The deployment of carbon dioxide removal 
(CDR) is distinct from the deployment of net negative CO 2 emissions, because it is also used to neutralise residual CO 2 emissions to 
achieve and sustain net zero CO 2 emissions. CDR deployment can be considerable in pathways without net negative emissions and 
all pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C use it to some extent.
FAQ 3.2 |   How can net zero emissions be achieved and what are the implications of net zero 
emissions for the climate?
Halting global warming in the long term requires, at a minimum, that no additional CO 2 emissions from human activities are added 
to the atmosphere (i.e., CO 2 emissions must reach ‘net’ zero). Given that CO 2 emissions constitute the dominant human influence 
on global climate, global net zero CO 2 emissions are a prerequisite for stabilising warming at any level. However, CO 2 is not the 
only greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming and reducing emissions of other greenhouse gases (GHGs) alongside 
CO2 towards net zero emissions of all GHGs would lower the level at which global temperature would peak. The temperature 
implications of net zero GHG emissions depend on the bundle of gases that is being considered, and the emissions metric used to 
calculate aggregated GHG emissions and removals. If reached and sustained, global net zero GHG emissions using the 100-year 
Global Warming Potential (GWP-100) will lead to gradually declining global temperature.
Not all emissions can be avoided. Achieving net zero CO 2 emissions globally therefore requires deep emissions cuts across all sectors 
and regions, along with active removal of CO 2 from the atmosphere to balance remaining emissions that may be too difficult, too 
costly, or impossible to abate at that time. Achieving global net zero GHG emissions would require, in addition, deep reductions of 
non-CO 2 emissions and additional CO 2 removals to balance remaining non-CO 2 emissions.
Not all regions and sectors must reach net zero CO 2 or GHG emissions individually to achieve global net zero CO 2 or GHG emissions, 
respectively; instead, positive emissions in one sector or region can be compensated by net negative emissions from another sector 
or region. The time each sector or region reaches net zero CO 2 or GHG emissions depends on the mitigation options available, the 
cost of those options, and the policies implemented (including any consideration of equity or fairness). Most modelled pathways 
that likely limit warming to 2°C (>67%) above pre-industrial levels and below use land-based CO 2 removal such as afforestation/
reforestation and BECCS to achieve net zero CO 2 and net zero GHG emissions even while some CO 2 and non-CO 2 emissions continue 
to occur. Pathways with more demand-side interventions that limit the amount of energy we use, or where the diet that we consume 
is changed, can achieve net zero CO 2, or net zero GHG emissions with less carbon dioxide removal (CDR). All available studies 
require at least some kind of carbon dioxide removal to reach net zero; that is, there are no studies where absolute zero GHG or 
even CO 2 emissions are reached by deep emissions reductions alone.
Total GHG emissions are greater than emissions of CO 2 only; reaching net zero CO 2 emissions therefore occurs earlier, by up to 
several decades, than net zero GHG emissions in all modelled pathways. In most modelled pathways that likely limit warming to 2°C 
(>67%) above pre-industrial levels and below in the most cost-effective way, the agriculture, forestry and other land-use (AFOLU) 
and energy supply sectors reach net zero CO 2 emissions several decades earlier than other sectors; however, many pathways show 
much reduced, but still positive, net GHG emissions in the AFOLU sector in 2100.
FAQ 3.3 |  How plausible are high emissions scenarios, and how do they inform policy?
IAMs are used to develop a wide range of scenarios describing future trajectories for greenhouse gas emissions based on a wide set 
of assumptions regarding socio-economic development, technological changes, political development and climate policy. Typically, 
the IAM-based scenarios can be divided into (i) reference scenarios (describing possible trajectories in the absence of new stringent 
climate policies) and (ii) mitigation scenarios (describing the impact of various climate policy assumptions). Reference scenarios 
typically result in high emissions and, subsequently, high levels of climate change (in the order of 2.5°C–4°C during the 21st century). 
The purpose of such reference scenarios is to explore the consequences of climate change and act as a reference for mitigation 
scenarios. The possible emission levels for reference scenarios diverge from stabilising and even slowly declining emissions (e.g., for 
current policy scenarios or SSP1) to very high emission levels (e.g., SSP5 and RCP8.5). The latter leads to nearly 5°C of warming 
by the end of the century for medium climate sensitivity. Hausfather and Peters (2020) pointed out that since 2011, the rapid 
development of renewable energy technologies and emerging climate policy have made it considerably less likely that emissions 
could end up as high as RCP8.5. This means that reaching emissions levels as high as RCP8.5 has become less likely. Still, high 
emissions cannot be ruled out for many reasons, including political factors and, for instance, higher than anticipated population 
and economic growth. Climate projections of RCP8.5 can also result from strong feedbacks of climate change on (natural) emission 
sources and high climate sensitivity (AR6 WGI Chapter 7). Therefore, their median climate impacts might also materialise while 
following a lower emission path (e.g., Hausfather and Betts 2020). All in all, this means that high-end scenarios have become 
considerably less likely since AR5 but cannot be ruled out. High-end scenarios (like RCP8.5) can be very useful to explore high-end 
risks of climate change but are not typical ‘business-as-usual’ projections and should therefore not be presented as such.

Executive Summary
This chapter focuses on accelerating mitigation and on shifting 
development pathways to increased sustainability, based on literature 
particularly at national scale. While previous WGIII assessments have 
discussed mitigation pathways, focus on development pathways is 
more recent. The timeframe is the near term (now up to 2030) to 
mid-term (2030 to 2050), complementing Chapter 3 on the long term 
(from 2050 onward).
An emissions gap persists, exacerbated by an implementation 
gap, despite mitigation efforts including those in near-universal 
nationally determined contributions (NDCs). The ‘emissions gap’ 
is understood as the difference between the emissions with NDCs in 
2030, and mitigation pathways consistent with the temperature goals. 
In general, the term ‘implementation gap’ refers to the difference 
between goals on paper and how they are achieved in practice. In 
this report, the term refers to the gap between mitigation pledges 
contained in national determined contributions, and the expected 
outcome of existing policies. There is considerable literature on 
country-level mitigation pathways, including but not limited to NDCs. 
Country distribution of this literature is very unequal (robust evidence, 
high agreement). Current policies lead to median global greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions of 57 GtCO 2-eq with a full range of 52–60 by 
2030. NDCs with unconditional and conditional elements1 lead to 

medium agreement) (Table 4.3). This leaves estimated emissions gaps 
in 2030 between projected outcomes of unconditional elements of 
NDCs and emissions in scenarios that limit warming to 1.5°C (>50%) 
with no or limited overshoot of 19–26 GtCO 2-eq, and 10–16 GtCO 2-eq 
for scenarios that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) with immediate action. 
When conditional elements of NDCs are included, these gaps narrow 
to 16–23 GtCO 2-eq and 6–14 GtCO 2-eq, respectively. {Cross-Chapter 
Box 4, Figure 1}
Studies evaluating up to 105 updated NDCs submitted by 
October 2021 indicate that emissions in conditional NDCs 
have been reduced by 4.5 (2.7–6.3) GtCO 2-eq, but only closes 
the emission gaps by about one-third to 2°C and about 20% 
to 1.5°C compared to the original NDCs submitted in 2015/16 
(medium evidence, medium agreement). The magnitude of these 
emission gaps calls into question whether current development 
pathways and efforts to accelerate mitigation are adequate to achieve 
the Paris mitigation objectives. In addition, an implementation gap 
exists between the projected emissions of ‘current policies’ and 
the projected emissions resulting from the implementation of the 
unconditional and conditional elements of NDCs, and is estimated to 
be around and 7 GtCO 2-eq in 2030, respectively (medium evidence, 
medium agreement), with many countries requiring additional 
policies and associated climate action to meet their autonomously 
determined mitigation targets as specified under the first NDCs 
(limited evidence). There is, furthermore, a  potential difference 
between mitigation targets set in NDCs ex ante and what is achieved 
ex post. A  limited number of studies assess the implementation 
gaps of conditional NDCs in terms of finance, technology and 

epidemic increase uncertainty over range of projections relative 
to pre-COVID-19 literature. As indicated by a  growing number of 
studies at the national and global level, how large near- to mid-term 
emissions implications of the COVID-19 pandemic are, to a  large 
degree depends on how stimulus or recovery packages are designed. 
{4.2, 4.2.2.5, Cross-Chapter Box 4}
Given the gaps, there is a  need to explore accelerated 
mitigation (relative to NDCs and current policies). There is 
increasing understanding of the technical content of accelerated 
mitigation pathways, differentiated by national circumstances, with 
considerable though uneven literature at country-level (medium 
evidence, high agreement). Transformative technological and 
institutional changes for the near term include demand reductions 
through efficiency and reduced activity, rapid decarbonisation of the 
electricity sector and low-carbon electrification of buildings, industry 
and transport (robust evidence, medium agreement). A  focus on 
energy use and supply is essential, but not sufficient on its own – 
the land sector and food systems deserve attention. The literature 
does not adequately include demand-side options and systems 
analysis, and captures the impact from non-CO 2 GHGs with medium 
confidence. Countries and regions will have different starting points 
for transition pathways. Some factors include climate conditions 
resulting in different heating and cooling needs, endowments with 
different energy resources, patterns of spatial development, and 
political and economic conditions. {4.2.5}
Accelerated mitigation alone may run into obstacles. If such 
obstacles are rooted in underlying structural features of society, then 
transforming such structures helps remove obstacles, which amounts 
to shifting development pathways. Various actors have developed an 
increasing number of mitigation strategies up to 2050 (mid-term). 
A growing number of such strategies aim at net zero GHG or CO 2 
emissions, but it is not yet possible to draw global implications due 
to the limited size of sample (medium evidence, low agreement). 
Non-state actors are also engaging in a  wide range of mitigation 
initiatives. When adding up emission reduction potentials, sub-
national and non-state international cooperative initiatives could 
reduce up to about 20 GtCO 2-eq in 2030 (limited evidence, medium 
agreement). Yet perceived or real conflicts between mitigation and 
other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) can impede such 
action. If undertaken without precaution, accelerated mitigation is 
found to have significant implications for development objectives and 
macroeconomic costs at country level. For example, most country-
level mitigation modelling studies in which GDP is an endogenous 
variable report negative impacts of mitigation on GDP in 2030 and 
2050, relative to the reference. In all reviewed studies, however, 
GDP continues to grow even with mitigation (robust evidence, high 
agreement). The literature finds that employment effect of mitigation 
policies tends to be limited on aggregate, but can be significant 
at sectoral level (limited evidence, medium agreement). Detailed 
design of mitigation policies is critical for distributional impacts and 
avoiding lock-in (robust evidence, high agreement), though further 
research is needed in that direction. {4.2.3, 4.2.4, 4.2.6}
offers ways to (i) broaden the range of levers and enablers 
that a  society can use to provide enabling conditions and 
accelerate mitigation; and (ii) increase the chances of 
advancing at the same time towards mitigation and towards 
other development goals. The way countries develop determines 
their capacity to accelerate mitigation and achieve other sustainable 
development objectives simultaneously (medium-robust evidence, 
medium agreement). Yet meeting ambitious mitigation and 
development goals cannot be achieved through incremental change, 
hence the focus on shifting development pathways (robust evidence, 
medium agreement). Though development pathways result from the 
actions of a wide range of actors, it is possible to shift development 
pathways through policies and enhancing enabling conditions (limited 
evidence, medium agreement). For example, policies such as those 
listed in Table 4.12 are typically associated with broader objectives 
than greenhouse gas mitigation. They are generally conceived and 
implemented in the pursuit of overall societal development objectives, 
such as job creation, macroeconomic stability, economic growth, and 
public health and welfare. In some countries, such policies are framed 
as part of a just transition. However, they can have major influence 
on mitigative capacity, and hence can be seen as tools to broaden 
mitigation options, as illustrated by the Illustrative Mitigation 
Pathway ‘Shifting Pathways’ (medium evidence, medium agreement). 
There are practical options to shift development pathways in ways 
that advance mitigation and other sustainable development 
objectives, supporting political feasibility, increase resources to 
meet multiple goals, and reduce emissions (limited evidence, high 
agreement). Concrete examples assessed in this chapter include high 
employment and low emissions structural change, fiscal reforms for 
mitigation and social contract, combining housing policies to deliver 
both housing and transport mitigation, and change economic, social 
and spatial patterns of development of the agriculture sector provide 
the basis for sustained reductions in emissions from deforestation. 
These examples differ by context. Examples in other chapters include 
transformations in energy, urban, building, industrial, transport, and 
land-based systems, changes in behaviour and social practices, as well 
as transformational changes across whole economies and societies. 
Coordinated policy mixes would need to coordinate multiple actors – 
individuals, groups and collectives, corporate actors, institutions and 
infrastructure actors – to deepen decarbonisation and shift pathways 
towards sustainability. Shifts in one country may spill over to other 
countries. Shifting development pathways can jointly support 
mitigation and adaptation. Some studies explore the risks of high 
complexity and potential delay attached to shifting development 
pathways. {4.3, 4.3.1, 4.3.2, 4.4.2, 4.4.3, 4.4.1.7–4.4.1.10, Figure 4.7,

The literature identifies a broad set of enabling conditions that 
can both foster shifting development pathways and accelerated 
mitigation, along five categories (medium evidence, high 
agreement). Policy integration is a necessary component of shifting 
development pathways, addressing multiple objectives. To this aim, 
mobilising a range of policies is preferable to single policy instruments 
(robust evidence, high agreement). Governance for climate mitigation 
and shifting development pathways is enhanced when tailored to national and local contexts. Improved institutions and governance 
enable ambitious climate action and help bridge implementation 
gaps (medium evidence, high agreement). Given that strengthening 
institutions may be a  long term endeavour, it needs attention in 
the near ter  m. Accelerated mitigation and shifting development 
pathways necessitates both redirecting existing financial flows from 
high- to low-emissions technologies and systems and to provide 
additional resources to overcome current financial barriers (robust 
evidence, high agreement). Opportunities exist in the near term to 
close the finance gap. At the national level, public finance for actions 
promoting the SDG agenda helps broaden the scope of mitigation 
(medium evidence, medium agreement). Changes in behaviour and 
lifestyles are important to move beyond mitigation as incremental 
change, and when supporting shifts to more sustainable development 
pathways will broadening the scope of mitigation (medium evidence, 
medium agreement). The direction of innovation matters (robust 
evidence, high agreement). The necessary transformational changes 
are likely to be more acceptable if rooted in the development 
aspirations of the economy and society within which they take place. 
{4.4.1, 4.4.1.2, 4.4.1.3, 4.4.1.4, 4.4.1.5, 4.4.1.6, Figure 4.8, 15.2.2}
Equity can be an important enabler of deeper ambition for 
accelerated mitigation, dealing with the distribution of costs and 
benefits and how these are shared as per social contracts, national 
policy and international agreements. Transition pathways have 
distributional consequences such as large changes in employment 
and economic structure (robust evidence, high agreement). In that 
regard, the just transition concept has become an international focal 
point tying together social movements, trade unions, and other key 
stakeholders to ensure equity is better accounted for in low-carbon 
transitions. Effectiveness of cooperative action and the perception of 
fairness of such arrangements are closely related, in that pathways 
that prioritise equity and allow broad stakeholders participation can 
enable broader consensus for the transformational change implied 
by deeper mitigation efforts (robust evidence, medium agreement). 
Hence, equity is a  concept that is instrumentally important. 
{4.5, Figure 4.9}
In sum, this chapter suggests that the immediate tasks are 
to broaden and deepen mitigation in the near term if the global 
community is to deliver emission reductions at the scale required 
to keep temperature well below 2°C and pursue efforts at  1.5°C. 
Deepening mitigation means more rapid decarbonisation. Shifting 
development pathways to increased sustainability (SDPS) broadens 
the scope of mitigation. Putting the enabling conditions above in 
place supports both. Depending on context, some enabling conditions 
such as shifting behaviour may take time to establish, underscoring 
the importance of early action. Other enabling conditions, such as 
improved access to financing, can be put in place in a relatively short 
time frame, and can yield results rapidly.
Accelerating mitigation: The literature points to well-understood 
policy measures and technologies for accelerating mitigation, though 
the balance depends on country specificities: (i) decarbonising 
electricity supply to produce net zero CO2, including renewable 
energy, (ii) radically more efficient use of energy than today; 
(iii) electrification of end-uses including transport; (iv) dramatically 
or zero-carbon fuels (e.g., hydrogen, bioenergy, ammonia) in hard-
to-decarbonise sectors; (vi) promote bioenergy, demand reduction, 
dietary changes, and policies, incentives, and rules for mitigation in 
the land sector; and (vii) setting and meeting ambitious targets to 
reduce methane and other short-lived climate forcers. Charting just 
transitions to net zero may provide a vision, which policy measures 
can help achieve. Though there is increasing experience with 
pricing carbon directly or indirectly, decision-makers might consider 
a broader toolbox of enablers and levers that is available in domains 
that have not traditionally been considered climate policy. {4.5, 
Annex II.IV.11}
Broadening opportunities by focusing on development pathways 
and considering how to shift them: Some of the policy measures may 
yield rapid results, whereas other, larger transformations may take 
longer. If we are to overcome obstacles, a near-term priority is to put 
in place the enabling conditions to shifting development pathways 
to increased sustainability. Learning from the examples above, 
focusing on SDPS also provides a broader set of tools to accelerating 
mitigation and achieve other sustainable development goals. 
Consider climate whenever you make choices about development, 
and vice versa. {4.4.1}
The recent IPCC Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5) made 
clear that the next three decades are critical if we are to achieve 
the long-term mitigation goal of the Paris Agreement (IPCC 2018a). 
The present chapter assesses the literature on mitigation and 
development pathways over that timeframe, in the near (up to 2030) 
and mid-term (up to 2050).
It considers three questions: (i) Where are we heading now? That 
is, what is the current state of affairs with respect to climate 
mitigation and how did we get here? (ii) Where do we want to go? 
For example, what state of affairs would meet the objectives of the 
Paris Agreement and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs)? and (iii) How do we bring about this shift? In other words, 
what interventions are at societies’ disposal to bring about the 
necessary change in an equitable manner?
Where are we heading now? Despite the drop in emissions due to 
the COVID-19 crisis, the gap between projected emissions based on 
Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in 2030 and emissions 
pathways compatible with the long term temperature goal set in the 
Paris Agreement remains large (Section  4.2.2). In addition to this 
persistent emissions gap, we face an implementation gap, as current 
policies are insufficient to achieve mitigation targets in NDCs, and 
sufficient international support is not yet available to developing 
countries who have requested and quantified support needs. 
Continuing along a development pathway characterised by the same 
underlying drivers, structural obstacles and insufficient enabling 
conditions that led to high emissions will not address the problem 
(robust evidence, high agreement).
The analysis of the gap is conducted together with Chapter 3 (Cross-
Chapter Box  4  in this chapter). Chapter  3  is working backward, 
assessing mitigation in the long term (beyond 2050 up to 2100) to 
draw the near- and mid-term implications of long-term temperature 
and mitigations goals. Chapter  4, on the other hand, works 
forward from current and planned mitigation (including NDCs) 
(Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2) and from current development paths to 
assess the implications for near- and mid-term greenhouse gases 
(GHG) emissions and development goals. Some countries, regions, 
cities, communities and non-state actors are taking leadership in 
implementing more ambitious action (Section  4.2.3). This chapter 
also assesses national low emission development strategies 
(Section 4.2.4).
Where do we want to go? Technical alternatives and policy options 
exist to bridge the emissions and implementation gaps, and the 
literature illustrates these with a wide range of accelerated techno-
economic pathways that deepen decarbonisation closer to the pace 
and scale required (Section  4.2.5), and examines their impacts on 
other development objectives (Section 4.2.6). In practice, however, 
scaling up at the broader, deeper, and faster level required to meet 
climate goals while advancing other development objectives regularly 
faces prohibitive obstacles (Section 4.2.7). Mitigation policies grafted 
on to existing development pathways are unlikely to achieve rapid 
and deep emission reductions.Secondly, even if carefully designed, climate policies to accelerate 
mitigation may have adverse consequences for other development 
objectives. As a complement to mitigation action, taking action to 
shift development pathways towards sustainability broadens the 
range of mitigation options, while increasing the possibility to meet 
other development priorities at the same time (medium evidence, 
high agreement).
Development pathways and shifting them to increased sustainability 
are introduced in Chapter  1, and constitute a  thread throughout 
the report (see ‘development pathways’ in Annex  I: Glossary). 
The AR6 WGII Report highlights the related concept of climate 
resilient development pathways (AR6 WGII, Chapter  18). Cross-
Chapter Box  5  in this chapter  – on shifting sustainable pathway 
towards sustainability  – elaborates on the concept. The influence 
of development pathways on emissions and mitigative capacity is 
discussed in Chapter  2. Chapter  3  assesses modelling of shifts in 
development pathways, illustrated by the illustrative mitigation 
pathway called ‘shifting pathways’. The importance of behavioural 
change as societies make decisions that intentionally shift their 
future development pathway is emphasised in Chapter 5. The systems 
Chapters (6–12) take sectoral perspectives, while pathways that are 
sustainable are the specific focus of Chapter 17.
How can one shift development pathway and accelerate 
mitigation? The literature does not provide a  complete handbook 
for shifting development pathways and accelerating mitigation. 
The literature does, however, shed light on some of the underlying 
dynamics. Shifting development pathways can be necessitated by the 
existence of pervasive obstacles that prove prohibitive to reaching 
mitigation and other development objectives (Section 4.2.7). Deliberate 
measures taken to facilitate the shifting of development pathways 
and accelerated mitigation involve putting in place key enabling 
conditions that help overcome those obstacles (Figure 4.6) – improving 
governance and institutional capacity, fostering behavioural change 
and technological innovation, designing and implementing adequate 
policy, and finance. Just transitions, while they will differ by context, 
are critical to identifying and avoiding or addressing inequitable 
distributive consequences (robust evidence,  high agreement).
Enabling conditions necessary to accelerate mitigation and shift 
development pathways are discussed in depth in Chapters  5, 13, 
14, 15 and 16. In addition, Chapters  13 and 14 detail the policy 
instruments that could help shift development pathways and 
accelerate the scale and pace of mitigation, while Chapter 4 describes 
those in broad strategies terms. Chapter  13 adds more texture 
on  institutional and governance machinery; policy choice, 
design and implementation; as well as policy formulation processes, 
actors and structure across scales.
Since development pathways and mitigation options depend to 
large extent on national objectives and circumstances, this chapter 
is primarily concerned with literature at national level (or in the case 
of the European Union, at regional level), while Chapter 3 is primarily 
concerned with literature at global scale. The national scale selected 
in this chapter requires attention as national mitigation pathways 
cannot be linked directly to global mitigation goals (Box 4.2). This 
and mitigation pathways, as distinct from detailed sectoral work that 
is assessed in the systems Chapters 6 to 12. The present chapter also 
assesses literature on non-state action.
Chapter 4 draws on five major strands of literature: (i) an emerging 
literature on development pathways  – conceptual, empirical, and 
model-based, including at the national and sub-national scales; 
(ii)  a  rapidly expanding, model-based, literature on mitigation 
pathways in the near- and mid-term (Lepault and Lecocq 2021); 
(iii)  studies of NDCs and mid-century strategies; (iv) a  broader 
literature on transformation and shifts in development pathways, 
including from non-climate literatures; and (v) a significant literature 
on equity, including just transitions. This is supported by a database 
of country-level mitigation scenarios at country level assembled for 
the preparation of this chapter (Annex III, Table I.10 and I.11).
The chapter builds on past IPCC reports. In AR5, all mitigation 
pathways were assessed in a  single chapter (Clarke et al. 2014), 
which focused mostly on the long term. IPCC Special Report on 
Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5) included a chapter on mitigation 
pathways compatible with the temperature goal in the Paris 
Agreement (Rogelj et al. 2018a), mostly at the global level. It also 
considered strengthening mitigation (de Coninck et al. 2018) in the 
context of poverty, inequality and sustainable development (Roy et al. 
2018). Development pathways have also been explored, albeit less 
frequently, in past IPCC reports starting with the Special Report on 
Emissions Scenarios (Nakicenovic et al. 2000). Some early framing of 
development pathways was included in the Third Assessment Report 
(Banuri et al. 2001), further developed in the Fourth Assessment 
Report (Sathaye et al. 2007). An extended discussion of climate 
change and equity was conducted in AR5 (Fleurbaey et al. 2014).
Chapter  4  examines mitigation within the broader context of 
development pathways, and examines how shifting development 
pathways can have a  major impact on mitigative capacity and 
broadening mitigation options. It is organised as follows.
Section 4.2 demonstrates that collective mitigation actions fall short 
of pathways that keep in reach the Paris temperature goals in the long 
term. Section 4.3 introduces development pathways (given its relative 
novelty in IPCC assessments), considers the implications of mitigation 
for development and vice versa, and articulates an approach on both 
accelerating mitigation and shifting development pathways.
Section  4.4 discusses how to shift development pathway and 
accelerate the scale and pace of mitigation, what levers are available 
to policymakers, and how policies may intersect with adaptation 
goals. It points out that development pathways also drive adaptation 
and adaptative capacity, and discusses various risks associated with 
shifting development pathways and accelerated mitigation strategies.
Finally, equity and just transitions are recurring themes in the 
chapter, specifically in relation to accelerating mitigation and shifting 
development pathways toward sustainability. In Section  4.2.2.7, 
equity is discussed in the context of Parties’ assertions regarding 
the fairness of their NDCs, alongside reflections from academic scholarship on the ethical underpinnings of these assertions and of 
various quantitative analyses of equitable effort-sharing. Section 4.2.6 
discusses certain distributional implications of domestic mitigation 
efforts, such as shifts in employment. Sections  4.2.7 and  4.3 note 
the relevance of potential distributional impacts as an obstacle to 
climate action, as well as the inequitable distribution of decision-
making authority. Finally, Section  4.5 recognises the structural 
relationship between equity and climate, explores just transitions as 
an international focal point tying together social movements, trade 
unions, and other stakeholders, and thus an instrumental role in 
establishing consensus.
4.2 Accelerating Mitigation Actions  
Across Scales
4.2.1 Mitigation Targets and Measures in Nationally 
Determined Contributions
A central instrument of the Paris Agreement is the NDCs, submitted by 
each country, and reflecting national efforts to reduce GHG emissions 
and build resilience to the impacts of climate change. Every five years, 
collective progress will be compared against long-term goals of the 
Paris Agreement. Considering the outcome of a  global stocktake, 
countries will prepare subsequent NDCs, showing progression in their 
ambition and enhancing international cooperation (UNFCCC 2015a).
Prior to COP21, in 2015, most countries submitted their Intended 
Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), which included 
mitigation targets for 2025 or 2030. INDCs become first NDCs on 
ratification and/or after national governments’ revision, and by 

with 105 new and updated NDCs from 132 Parties to the Paris 
Agreement, covering 53% of the total global emissions in 2019 
of 52.4  GtCO 2-eq without land use, land-use change and forestry 
(LULUCF), and 13 second NDCs. Most of the Parties that submitted 
new or updated NDCs have demonstrated increased ambition in 
addressing climate change. Moreover, though some countries have 
not submitted their updated NDCs yet, they have already announced 
their updated NDC goals somewhere. Countries will take the first 
stock in 2023 based on their progression towards achieving the 
objectives of Paris Agreement (UNFCCC 2015a, 2018a; SB Chairs 
2021) (Section 14.3.2.5).
Submitted NDCs vary in content, scope and background assumptions. 
First NDCs contain mitigation targets, and in many cases also 
provisions about adaptation. The mitigation targets range from 
economy-wide absolute emission reduction targets to strategies, 
plans and actions for low-emission development. Baseline years vary 
from 1990 to 2015 and in almost all NDCs the targeted time frame is 
2030, with a few specified periods of until 2025, 2035, 2040 or 2050. 
Around 43% of the mitigation targets in first NDCs are expressed in 
terms of deviation below business-as-usual by a specified target year, 
either for the whole economy or for specific sectors, while around 
35% include fixed-level targets (either reductions or limitations 
compared to base years), and another 22% refer to intensity targets 
(in terms of GHG, CO 2 or energy) or policies and measures, with an 
targets in their new or updated NDCs (UNFCCC 2016a, 2021). Some 
developing countries’ NDCs include unconditional elements, while 
others include conditional ones, the latter with higher ambition if 
finance, technology and capacity building support from developed 
countries is provided (UNFCCC 2016a).2 In some NDCs, the additional 
mitigation is quantified, in others not (Figure 14.2).
Most first NDCs cover all specific sectors, including LULUCF , and 
communicate specific targets for individual sub-sectors to support 
their overall mitigation targets. Concrete actions and priority areas 
are more detailed in the energy sector, with increased share of 
renewable energies and energy efficiency being highlighted in the 
majority of NDCs. Given the uncertainty behind LULUCF emission 
and removal accounting (Grassi et al. 2017; Jian et al. 2019), several 
countries state that their accounting framework will only be defined 
in later NDCs. The GHG included and the global warming potentials 
(GWPs) used to aggregate emissions also vary across NDCs. Most 
countries only refer to carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide 
emissions aggregated based on IPCC AR2 or AR4 metrics, while few 
NDCs also include fluorinated gases and use IPCC AR5 GWPs. The 
shares of Parties that indicate possible use of at least one type of 
voluntary cooperation and set qualitative limits on their use have 
both nearly doubled in new or updated NDCs.
There is considerable literature on country-level mitigation 
pathways, including but not limited to NDCs. Country distribution 
of this literature is very unequal (robust evidence,  high agreement). 
In particular, there is a growing literature on (I)NDCs, with a wide 
scope which includes estimate of emissions levels of NDCs 
(Section  4.2.2.2); alignment with sustainable development goals 
(Caetano et al. 2020; Campagnolo and Davide 2019; Fuso Nerini 
et al. 2019; Antwi-Agyei et al. 2018); ambition (Höhne et al. 2018; 
Vogt-Schilb and Hallegatte 2017; Hermwille et al. 2019); energy 
development (Scott et al. 2018); and the legality of downgrading 
NDCs (Rajamani and Brunnée 2017). Other studies note that many 
NDCs contain single-year mitigation targets, and suggest that 
a multi-year trajectory is important for more rigorous monitoring 
(Elliott et al. 2017; Dagnet et al. 2017).
The literature also points out that beyond the ‘headline numbers’, 
information in (I)NDCs is difficult to analyse (Pauw et al. 2018). 
Information for ‘clarity, transparency and understanding’ is to be 
communicated with NDCs, although initial guidance was not specific 
(UNFCCC 2014). While the adoption of the Paris rule-book provided 
some greater specificity (UNFCCC 2018b,c), the information included 
in the NDCs remains uneven. Many NDCs omit important mitigation 
sectors and do not adequately provide details on costs and financing 
of implementation (Pauw et al. 2018). Countries are also invited to 
explain how their NDCs are fair and ambitious, though the way this 
has been done so far has been criticised as insufficiently rigorous 
(Winkler et al. 2018).

mainly on domestic abatement actions, although countries can use international cooperation to meet their targets. ‘Conditional’ NDCs require international cooperation, 
for example bilateral agreements under article 6, financing or monetary and/or technological transfers (14.3.2).4.2.2 Aggregate Effects of NDCs and Other 
Mitigation Efforts Relative to Long-term 
Mitigation Pathways
4.2.2.1 Introduction
Near-term mitigation targets submitted as part of NDCs to the 
UNFCCC, as well as currently implemented policies, provide a basis 
for assessing potential emissions levels up to 2030 at the national, 
regional and global level. The following sections present an evaluation 
of the methods used for assessing projected emissions under NDCs 
and current policies (Section  4.2.2.2), and the results of these 
assessments at global, regional and national level assessing a broad 
available literature based on first NDC submissions from 2015/16 
and pre-COVID economic projections (Section 4.2.2.3). The impacts 
of the COVID-19 pandemic and related government responses on 
emissions projections are then discussed in Section 4.2.2.4 and the 
implications of updated NDCs submitted in 2020/21 on emissions 
follow in Section  4.2.2.5. Section  4.2.2.6 presents an assessment 
of the so-called ‘implementation gap’ between what currently 
implemented policies are expected to deliver and what the ambitions 
laid out under the full implementation of the NDCs are projected to 
achieve. Finally, a comparison of ambitions across different countries 
or regions (Section  4.2.2.7) is presented and the uncertainties of 
projected emissions associated with NDCs and current policies are 
estimated, including a discussion of measures to reduce uncertainties 
in the specification of NDCs (Section 4.2.2.8).
The literature reviewed in this section includes globally comprehensive 
assessments of NDCs and current policies, both peer-reviewed and 
non-peer-reviewed (but not unpublished model results) as well as 
synthesis reports by the UNFCCC Secretariat, government reports 
and national studies.
The aggregate effects of NDCs provide information on where 
emissions might be in 2025/2030, working forward from their recent 
levels. Chapter 3 of this report works backwards from temperature 
goals, defining a  range of long-term global pathways consistent 
with 1.5°C, 2°C and higher temperature levels. By considering the 
two together, it is possible to assess whether NDCs are collectively 
consistent with 1.5°C, 2°C and other temperature pathways (Cross-
Chapter Box 4 in this chapter).
4.2.2.2 Methods to Project Emissions Under NDCs 
and Current Policies
A variety of different methods are used to assess emissions 
implications of NDCs and current policies over the time horizon to 

part of an official communication to UNFCCC (e.g., Biennial Report, 
Biennial Update Reports or National Communications) while the 
majority is from independent studies.
underlie the official communications) can broadly be separated 
into two groups:
1. system modelling studies which analyse policies and targets 
in a  comprehensive modelling framework such an integrated 
assessment, energy systems or integrated land-use model to 
project emissions (or other indicators) of mitigation targets in 
NDCs and current policies, either at the national or global scale 
(noting some differences in the systems); and
2. hybrid approaches that typically start out with emissions 
pathways as assessed by other published studies (e.g., the IEA 
World Energy Outlook, national emissions pathways such as 
those specified in some NDCs) and use these directly or apply 
additional modifications to them.
System modelling studies are conducted at global, regional and 
national scales. Global models provide an overview, are necessary 
for assessment of global phenomena (e.g.,  temperature change), 
can integrate climate models and trade effects. National models 
typically include more details on sectors, technology, behaviour and 
intersectoral linkages, but often use simplifying assumptions for 
international trade (e.g., the Armington elasticity approach). Critically, 
they can also better reflect local socio-economic and political 
conditions and their evolution (i.e., national development pathways). 
A variety of modelling paradigms are found, including optimisation 
and simulation models, myopic and with foresight, monolithic and 
modular (Annex III: Scenarios and Modelling Methods).
Among the hybrid approaches, three broader categories can be 
distinguished, (i) direct use of official emission projection as part of 
submitted NDC or other communication to UNFCCC, (ii) historical 
trend extrapolation of emissions based on inventory data, possibly 
disaggregated by sector and emission species, and (iii) use of 
Reference/Business-As-Usual pathways from an independent 
published study (e.g.,  IEA WEO). In all cases, the reductions are 
then estimated on top of the resulting emission trajectory. Note 
that globally comprehensive studies may vary the approach used 
depending on the country.
Beyond the method applied, studies also differ in a  number of 
dimensions, including (i) their spatial resolution and coverage, 
(ii) their sectoral resolution and coverage, (iii) the GHGs that are 
included in the assessment, the GWPs (or other metrics) to aggregate 
them, the emissions inventory (official vs independent inventory 
data) and related accounting approaches used as a  starting point 
for the projections, (iv) the set of scenarios analysed (Reference/
Business-As-Usual, Current Policies, NDCs, etc.), and (v) the degree to 
which individual policies and their impact on emissions are explicitly 
represented (Table 4.1).
First, the studies are relevant to different spatial levels, ranging 
from macro-scale regions with globally comprehensive coverage to 
national level (Section 4.2.2.3) and sub-national and company level in 
a few cases (Section 4.2.3). It is important to recognise that globally 
comprehensive studies typically resolve a limited number of countries 
individually, in particular those that contribute a high share to global emissions, but have poor resolution of remaining countries or regions, 
which are assessed in aggregate terms. Conversely, studies with high 
resolution of a particular country tend to treat interactions with the 
global scale in a limited way. The recent literature includes attempts 
to provide a composite global picture from detailed national studies 
(Bataille et al. 2016a; Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project 2015; 
Roelfsema et al. 2020).
A second dimension in which the studies are different is their 
comprehensiveness of covering different emitting sectors. Some 
studies focus on the contribution of a  single sector, for example 
the agriculture, forestry and other land use (AFOLU) sector (Fyson 
and Jeffery 2019; Grassi et al. 2017) or the energy system (including 
both energy supply and demand sectors), to emission reductions as 
specified in the NDC. Such studies give an indication of the importance 
of a given sector to achieving the NDC target of a country and can be 
used as a benchmark to compare to comprehensive studies, but adding 
sectoral contributions up represents a methodological challenge.
Third, GHG coverage is different across studies. Some focus on CO2 
only, while others take into account the full suite of Kyoto gases 
(CO 2, CH 4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs and SF 6). For the latter, different metrics 
for aggregating GHGs to a  CO 2-equivalent metric are being used, 
typically GWP 100 from different IPCC assessments (Table 4.1).
Fourth, studies typically cover a set of scenarios, though how these 
scenarios are defined varies widely. The literature reporting IAM 
results often includes Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), 
which are officially communicated, and Current Policies (CP) as 
interpreted by modellers. Studies based on national modelling, by 
contrast, tend to define scenarios reflecting very different national 
contexts. In both cases, modellers typically include so-called No 
Policy Baseline scenarios (alternatively referred to as Reference 
or Business-as-Usual scenarios) which do not necessarily reflect 
currently implemented policies and thus are not assessed as reference 
pathways (Section  4.2.6.1). There are also various approaches to 
considering more ambitious action compared to the CP or NDC 
projections that are covered in addition.
Fifth, studies differ in the way they represent policies (current or 
envisioned in NDCs), depending on their internal structure. For 
example, a subsidy to energy efficiency in buildings may be explicitly 
modelled (e.g.,  in a  sectoral model that represents household 
decisions relative to building insulation), represented by a  proxy 
(e.g.,  by an exogenous decrease in the discount rate households 
use to make choices), or captured by its estimated outcome (e.g., by 
an exogenous decrease in the household demand for energy, say in an 
energy system model or in a compact CGE). Detailed representations 
(such as the former example) do not necessarily yield more accurate 
results than compact ones (the latter example), but the set of 
assumptions that are necessary to represent the same policy will be 
very different.
Finally, policy coverage strongly varies across studies with some just 
implementing high level targets specified in policy documents and 
NDCs while others represent the policies with the largest impact 
on emissions and some looking at very detailed measures and 
evolving policy environments, slightly different cut-off dates for the 
policies considered in an emission projection can make a significant 
difference for the results (Dubash et al. 2018).
The challenges described above are dealt with in the assessment 
of quantitative results in Section 4.2.2.3 by (i) comparing national 
studies with country-level results from global studies to understand 
systematic biases; (ii) comparing economy-wide emissions (including 
AFOLU) as well as energy-related emissions; (iii) using different 
emission metrics including CO 2 and Kyoto GHG emissions where 
the latter have been harmonised to using AR6 GWP100 metrics; and 
(iv) tracking cut-off dates of implemented policies and NDCs used 
in different references (Table 4.SM.1). The most notable differences 
in quantitative emission estimates related to current policies 
and NDCs relate to the COVID-19 pandemic and its implications and 
to the updated NDCs mostly submitted since early 2020 which are 
separately dealt with in Sections 4.2.2.4 and 4.2.2.5, respectively.
In addition to assessing the emissions outcomes of NDCs, some 
studies report development indicators, by which they mean a wide

4.2.2.3 Projected Emissions Under NDCs and Current 
Policies by 2025/2030
The emissions projections presented in this section relate to the first 
NDCs, as communicated in 2015 and 2016, and on which an extensive 
literature exists. New and updated NDCs, mostly submitted since the 
beginning of 2020, are dealt with in Section  4.2.2.5. Similarly, 
the implications of COVID-19 and the related government responses 
on emissions projections is specifically dealt with in Section 4.2.2.4.
Table 4.1 presents the evidence base for the assessment of projected 
emissions of original NDCs and current policies until 2030. It covers 

emission (excluding FOLU CO 2 emissions) and draws quantitative 
estimates from more than 40 studies (Table  4.SM.1 in the 
Supplementary Material to this chapter). The table allows comparing 
emission projections from national and globally comprehensive 
studies as well as official communications by countries to the 
UNFCCC at the national/regional level. The global aggregates 
presented in Table  4.1 derive from globally comprehensive studies 
only and are not the result of aggregating country projections up 

Emissions Gap Report uses median and 10th to 90th percentile ranges. In addition, this report applies 100-year GWPs from AR6 to aggregate across different GHG 
emission species, whereas 100-year GWPs from AR4 were applied in IPCC SR1.5 and UNEP 2020a. The application of AR6 GWPs on average leads to increase of estimates 
by about 1.3% and ranges are wider due to the difference in statistical error metrics.to the global level. As different studies report different emission 
indicators, the table includes four different indicators: CO 2 and GHG 
emissions, including or excluding AFOLU emissions. Where possible, 
multiple indicators are included per study.
Globally comprehensive studies
The UNFCCC Secretariat has assessed the aggregate effect of NDCs 
multiple times. The first report considered the intended NDCs in 
relation to 2°C (UNFCCC 2015b), whereas the second considered 
NDCs also in relation to 1.5°C (UNFCCC 2016b). New submissions 
and updates of NDCs in 2020/21 are assessed in Section  4.2.2.5. 
A number of globally comprehensive studies (den Elzen et al. 2016; 
Luderer et al. 2016; Rogelj et al. 2016, 2017; Vandyck et al. 2016; 
Rose et al. 2017; Baumstark et al. 2021) which estimate aggregate 
emissions outcomes of NDCs and current policies have previously 
been assessed in Cross-Chapter-Box 11 of IPCC SR1.5.
According to the assessment in this report, studies projecting 
emissions of current policies based on pre-COVID assumptions lead 
to median global GHG emissions of 60 GtCO 2-eq with a full range 
of 54–68 by 2030 and original unconditional and conditional NDCs 
submitted in 2015/16 to 57 (49–63) and 54 (50–60) GtCO 2-eq, 
respectively (robust evidence, medium agreement) (Table  4.1). 
Globally comprehensive and national-level studies project emissions 
of current policies and NDCs to 2025 and 2030 and, in general, are 
in good agreement about projected emissions at the country level.
These estimates are close to the ones provided by the IPCC 
SR1.5, Cross-Chapter-Box  11, and the UNEP emissions gap 
report (UNEP 2020a).3
National studies
A large body of literature on national and regional emissions 
projections, including official communications of as part of the 
NDC submissions and independent studies exist. A  subset of this 
literature provides quantitative estimates for the 2030 timeframe. 
As highlighted in Section 4.2.1, the number of independent studies 
varies considerably across countries with an emphasis on the largest 
emitting countries. This is reflected in Table 4.1 (see also Table 4.SM.1). 
Despite smaller differences between globally comprehensive 
and national studies for a  few countries, there is generally good 
agreement between the different types of studies, providing evidence 
that these quantitative estimates are fairly robust.
Sectoral studies
Sectoral studies are essential to understand the contributions of 
concrete measures of NDCs and current policies. For example, 
approximately 98% of NDCs include the energy sector in their 
mitigation contributions, of which nearly 50% include a  specific 

communications to UNFCCC using different emission sources (fossil fuels, AFOLU sector) and different emission metrics (CO 2, Kyoto GHGs). The comparison allows identifying 
potential biases across the ranges and median estimates projected by the different sets of studies.

(e.g., Baumstark et al. 2021; Rogelj et al. 2017). g Note that AFOLU emissions from national GHG inventories and global/national land use models are generally different 
due to different approaches to estimate the anthropogenic CO 2 sink (Grassi et al. 2018, 2021) (Section 7.2.3 and Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 7). h The estimates for 
USA are based on the first NDC submitted prior to the withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, but not including the updated NDC submitted following its re-entry. i The EU

nuclear energy production (Stephan et al. 2016). Transport is covered 
explicitly in 75% of NDCs, although specific targets for the sector 
exist in only 21% of NDCs (PPMC and SLoCaT 2016). Measures or 
targets for buildings are referred to explicitly in 27% of NDCs (GIZ 
2017). Additionally, 36% of NDCs include targets or actions that are 
specific to the agriculture sector (FAO 2016). LULUCF (mitigation) is 
included in 80% of all submitted NDCs, while 59% include adaptation 
and 29% refer to REDD+.
Greater sectoral expertise and involvement will be critical to 
accomplishing development and climate goals due to enhanced 
availability of information and expertise on specific sectoral options, 
greater ease of aligning the NDCs with sectoral strategies, and greater 
awareness among sector-level decision-makers and stakeholders 
(Fekete et al. 2015; NDC Partnership 2017). Sector-specific studies 
are assessed in the sectoral Chapters (6 to 11) of this report.
4.2.2.4 Estimated Impact of COVID-19 and Governmental 
Responses on Emissions Projections
The impacts of COVID-19 and national governments’ economic 
recovery measures on current (Section 2.2.2) and projected emissions 
of individual countries and globally under current policies scenarios 
until 2030 may be significant, although estimates are highly uncertain 
and vary across the few available studies. The analyses published to 
date (October 2021) are based on limited information about how 
COVID-19 has affected the economy and hence GHG emissions 
across countries so far in 2020, and also based on assumptions about 
COVID-19’s longer term impact. Moreover, the comparison of pre- 
and post-COVID-19 projections captures the impact of COVID-19 as 
well as other factors such as the consideration of recently adopted 
policies not related to COVID-19, and methodological changes.
Across different studies (Kikstra et al. 2021; IEA 2020; Dafnomilis 
et al. 2021; Pollitt et al. 2021; UNEP 2020a; Climate Action Tracker 
2020; Keramidas et al. 2021; Dafnomilis et al. 2020), the impact of the 
general slowdown of the economy due to the COVID-19 pandemic 
and its associated policy responses would lead to a  reduced 
estimate of global GHG emissions in 2030 of about 1 to 5 GtCO 2-eq, 
equivalent to  1.5–8.5%, compared to the pre-COVID-19 estimates (Table  4.SM.2). Nascimento et al. (2021) analyse the impacts of 
COVID-19 on current policy emission projections for 26 countries and 
regions and find a large range of emission reduction – between –1% 
and –21% – across these.
As indicated by a  growing number of studies at the national and 
global level, how large near- to mid-term emissions implications 
of the COVID-19 pandemic are to a large degree depends on how 
stimulus or  recovery packages are designed (Forster et al. 2020; 
Gillingham et al. 2020; IEA 2020; Le Quéré et al. 2020; Malliet 
et al. 2020; Wang  et al. 2020; Obergassel et al. 2021; Pollitt et al. 
2021; UNEP 2020a).
Four studies (Climate Action Tracker 2021; den Elzen et al. 2021; JRC 
2021; Riahi et al. 2021) provide an update of the current policies 
assessment presented in Section 4.2.2.3 by taking into account the 
effects of COVID-19 as well as potential updates of policies. The 
resulting GHG emissions in 2030 are estimated to be 57 GtCO 2-eq 
with a full range of 52 to 60 GtCO 2-eq (Table 4.2). This is a reduction 
of about 3 GtCO 2-eq or 5% compared to the pre-COVID estimates 
from Section 4.2.2.3.
4.2.2.5 Estimated Impact of New and Updated NDCs 
on Emissions Projections
The number of studies estimating the emissions implications of new 
and updated NDCs and announced mitigation pledges that can be used 
for the quantitative assessment is limited to four (Table 4.3) (Climate 
Action Tracker 2021; den Elzen et al. 2021; Meinshausen et al. 2021; 
JRC 2021). One other study includes a limited number of NDC updates 
(Riahi et al. 2021) and another (UNFCCC 2021) excludes LULUCF 
emissions. They are therefore not directly comparable to the other two. 
In addition, the UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2021 (UNEP 2021) in itself 
is assessment of almost the same studies included here. The evidence 
base for the updated NDC assessment is thus considerably smaller 
compared to that of the assessment of emissions implications of original 
NDCs presented in Section 4.2.2.3. However, it is worthwhile to note 
that the earlier versions of the studies summarised in Table 4.2 and 
Table 4.3 are broadly representative for the emissions range implied by 
the pre-COVID-19 current policies and original NDCs of the full set of 
studies shown in Table 4.1, therefore building confidence in estimates.

c Range includes estimates from four models: GEM-E3, MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM, POLES, REMIND-MAgPIE, based on sensitivity analysis. d To avoid a bias due to multiple estimates

apply the same cut-off date for NDC updates, potentially leading 
to larger systematic deviations in the resulting emission estimates. 
Another complication is the fact that publicly announced mitigation 
pledges on global 2030 emissions that have not been officially 
submitted to the UNFCCC NDC registry yet, have been included in 
several of the studies to anticipate their impact on emission levels 
(see notes to Table 4.3). In addition to the updates of NDC targets, 
most of the new studies also include impacts of COVID-19 on future 
emission levels (as discussed in Section 4.2.2.4) which may have led 
to considerable downward revisions of emission trends unrelated to 
NDCs. Table 4.3 presents the emission estimates of the four studies 
that form the basis of the quantitative assessment presented here 
and three other studies to compare with.
Comparing the emission levels implied by the new and updated 
NDCs as shown in Table  4.3 with those estimated by the original 
NDCs from the same studies (as included in Table 4.1), a downward 
revision of 3.8 (3.0–5.3) GtCO 2-eq of the central unconditional NDC 
estimates and of 4.5 (2.7–6.3) GtCO 2-eq of the central conditional 
NDC estimate emerges (medium evidence, medium agreement). The 
emissions gaps between temperature limits and new and updated 
NDCs are assessed in Cross-Chapter Box 4 below. New and updated 
unconditional NDCs reduce the median gap with emissions pathways 
that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) in 2030 by slightly more than 20%, 
from a median gap of 17 GtCO 2-eq (9–23) to 13 (10–16). New and 
updated conditional NDCs reduce the median gap with emissions 
pathways that limt warming to 2°C (>67%) in 2030 by about one

a  median gap of 24  GtCO 2-eq (20–29) to 19  GtCO 2-eq (16–23). 
Box 4.1 discusses the adaptation gap.
Globally, the implementation gap between projected emissions of 
current policies and the unconditional and conditional new and 
updated NDCs is estimated to be around 4 and 7 GtCO 2-eq in 2030, 
respectively (medium evidence, medium agreement) (Tables  4.2 
and  4.3), with many countries requiring additional policies and 
associated climate action to meet their mitigation targets as 
specified under the NDCs (limited evidence) (Section  4.2.2.6). It 
should be noted that the implementation gap varies considerably 
across countries, with some having policies in place estimated to be 
sufficient to achieve the emission targets their NDCs, some where 
additional policies may be required to be sufficient, as well as 
differences between the policies in place and action on the ground.
4.2.2.6 Tracking Progress in Implementing 
and Achieving NDCs
Under the Enhanced Transparency Framework, countries will transition 
from reporting biennial reports (BRs) and biennial update reports 
(BURs) to reporting biennial transparency reports (BTRs) starting, at 
the latest, by December 2024. Each Party will be required to report 
information necessary to track progress made in implementing and 
achieving its NDC under the Paris Agreement (UNFCCC 2018b). Thus, 
no official data exists yet on tracking progress of individual NDCs.
Meanwhile, there is some literature at global and national level that 
aims at assessing whether countries are on track or progressing Table 4.3 | Projected global GHG emissions of new and updated NDCs by 2030.

collectively are sufficient to reach the temperature targets of the 
Paris agreement (Rogelj et al. 2016; Quéré et al. 2018; Höhne et al. 
2018; Roelfsema et al. 2020; den Elzen et al. 2019; Höhne et al. 2020). 
Most of these studies focus on major emitters such as G20 countries 
and with the aim to inform countries to strengthen their ambition 
regularly, for example, through progress of NDCs and as part of the 
global stocktake (Höhne et al. 2018; Peters et al. 2017). However, 
a  limited number of studies assess the implementation gaps of 
conditional NDCs in terms of finance, technology and capacity 
building support. Some authors conclude that finance needed to 
fulfil conditional NDCs exceeds available resources or the current 
long-term goal for finance (USD100 billion yr–1) (Pauw et al. 2019); 
others assess financial resources needed for forest-related activities 
(Kissinger et al. 2019) (Section 15.4.2). The literature suggests that 
consistent and harmonised approach to track progress of countries 
towards their NDCs would be helpful (Peters et al. 2017; Höhne et al. 
2018; den Elzen et al. 2019), and negotiations on a common tabular 
format are expected to conclude during COP26 in November 2021.
With an implementation gap in 2030 of 4  to 7  GtCO 2-eq 
(Section 4.2.2.5), many countries will need to implement additional 
policies to meet their self-determined mitigation targets as specified 
under the NDCs. Studies that assess the level of projected emissions 
under current policies indicate that new policies (that have been 
implemented since the first assessment of the NDCs in 2015 and are 
thus covered in more recent projections) have reduced projections, 
by about two GtCO 2-eq since the adoption of the Paris Agreement 
in 2015 to 2019 (Climate Action Tracker 2019; UNEP 2020a; 
den Elzen et al. 2019).
4.2.2.7 Literature on Fairness and Ambition of NDCs
Most countries provided information on how they consider their 
NDCs to be fair and ambitious in the NDCs submitted to UNFCCC and 
many of these NDCs refer to specific national circumstances such as 
social, economic and geographical factors when outlining why they 
are fair and ambitious. Further, several Parties provided information 
on specific criteria for evaluating fairness and ambition, including 
criteria relating to: responsibility and capability; share of emissions; 
development and/or technological capacity; mitigation potential; cost 
of mitigation actions; the degree of progression or stretching beyond 
the current level of effort; and the link to objectives and global goals 
(UNFCCC 2016a).
According to its Article 2.2, the Paris Agreement will be implemented 
to reflect equity and the principle of common but differentiated 
responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different 
national circumstances, the latter clause being new, added to 
the UNFCCC principle (Voigt and Ferreira 2016; Rajamani 2017). 
Possible different interpretations of equity principles lead to different 
assessment frameworks (Lahn and Sundqvist 2017; Lahn 2018).
Various assessment frameworks have been proposed to analyse 
fair share ranges for NDCs. The literature on equity frameworks 
including quantification of national emissions allocation is assessed 
in section 4.5 (Sections 13.4.2, 14.3.2 and 14.5.3). Recent literature has assessed equity, analysing how fairness is expressed in NDCs 
in a  bottom-up manner (Mbeva and Pauw 2016; Cunliffe et al. 
2019; Winkler et al. 2018). Some studies compare NDC ambition 
level with different effort sharing regimes and which principles are 
applied to various countries and regions (Peters et al. 2015; Pan 
et al. 2017; Robiou Du Pont et al. 2017; Holz et al. 2018; Robiou 
du Pont and Meinshausen 2018; van den Berg et al. 2019). Others 
propose multi-dimensional evaluation schemes for NDCs that 
combine a  range of indicators, including the NDC targets, cost-
effectiveness compared to global models, recent trends and policy 
implementation into consideration (Aldy et al. 2017; Höhne et al. 
2018). Yet other literature evaluates NDC ambition against factors 
such as technological progress of energy efficiency and low-carbon 
technologies (Jiang et al. 2017; Kuramochi et al. 2017; Wakiyama 
and Kuramochi 2017), synergies with adaptation plans (Fridahl 
and Johansson 2017), the obligations to deploy carbon dioxide 
removal technologies like bioenergy with carbon capture and 
storage (BECCS) in the future implied by their near-term emission 
reductions where they are not reflected on in the first NDCs (Peters 
and Geden 2017; Fyson et al. 2020; Pozo et al. 2020; Mace et al. 
2021). Others identify possible risks of unfairness when applying 
GWP* as emissions metric at national scale (Rogelj and Schleussner 
2019). A recent study on national fair shares draws on principles of 
international environmental law, excludes approaches based on cost 
and grandfathering, thus narrowing the range of national fair shares 
previously assessed, and apply this to the quantification of national 
fair share emissions targets (Rajamani et al. 2021).
4.2.2.8 Uncertainty in Estimates
There are many factors that influence the global aggregated effects of 
NDCs. There is limited literature on systematically analysing the impact 
of uncertainties on the NDC projections with some exception (Rogelj 
et al. 2017; Benveniste et al. 2018). The UNEP Gap Report (UNEP 
2017a) discusses uncertainties of NDC estimates in some detail. The 
main factors include variations in overall socio-economic development; 
uncertainties in GHG inventories; conditionality; targets with ranges or 
for single years; accounting of biomass; and different GHG aggregation 
metrics (e.g., GWP values from different IPCC assessments). In addition, 
when mitigation effort in NDCs is described as measures that do only 
indirectly translate into emission reductions, assumptions necessary 
for the translation come into play (Doelle 2019). For a more elaborate 
discussion of uncertainties in NDCs (Section 14.3.2).
Some studies assume successful implementation of all of the NDCs’ 
proposed measures, sometimes including varying assumptions to 
account for some of the NDC features which are subject to assumed 
conditions related to finance and technology transfer. Countries ‘shall 
pursue domestic mitigation measures’ under Article 4.2 of the Paris 
Agreement (UNFCCC 2015a), but they are not legally bound to the 
result of reducing emissions (Winkler 2017a). Some authors consider 
this to be a  lack of a  strong guarantee that mitigation targets in 
NDCs will be implemented (Nemet et al. 2017). Others point to 
growing extent of national legislation to provide a  legal basis for 
action (Iacobuta et al. 2018) (Section 13.2). These factors together 
with incomplete information in NDCs mean there is uncertainty 
about the estimates of anticipated 2030 emission levels.
2017; Benveniste et al. 2018). In particular, clarity on the contributions 
from the land use sector to NDCs is needed ‘to prevent high 
LULUCF uncertainties from undermining the strength and clarity of 
mitigation in other sectors’ (Fyson and Jeffery 2019). Methodological 
differences in the accounting of the LULUCF anthropogenic CO 2 
sink between scientific studies and national GHG inventories (as 
submitted to UNFCCC) further complicate the comparison and aggregation of emissions of NDC implementation (Grassi et al. 2018, 
2021) (Section  7.2.3 and Cross-Chapter Box  6  in Chapter  7). This 
uncertainty could be reduced with clearer guidelines for compiling 
future NDCs, in particular when it comes to mitigation efforts not 
expressed as absolute economy-wide targets (Doelle 2019), and 
explicit specification of technical details, including energy accounting 
methods, harmonised emission inventories (Rogelj et al. 2017) and 
finally, increased transparency and comparability (Pauw et al. 2018).

Introduction
The Paris Agreement (PA) sets a long-term goal of holding the increase of global average temperature to ‘well below 2°C above pre-
industrial levels’ and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. This is underpinned by 
the ‘aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible’ and ‘achieve a balance between anthropogenic 
emissions by sources and removals by sinks of GHG in the second half of this century’ (UNFCCC 2015a). The PA adopts a bottom-up 
approach in which countries determine their contribution to reach the PA’s long-term goal. These national targets, plans and measures 
are called ‘nationally determined contributions’ or NDCs.

Cross-Chapter Box 4, Figure 1 (continued): Global GHG emissions of modelled pathways (funnels in Panel a, and associated bars in Panels b, c, d) 
and projected emission outcomes from near-term policy assessments for 2030 (Panel b).
Panel a shows global GHG emissions over 2015–2050 for four types of assessed modelled global pathways: 
 – Trend from implemented policies: Pathways with projected near-term GHG emissions in line with policies implemented until the end of 2020 and 
extended with comparable ambition levels beyond 2030 (29 scenarios across categories C5–C7, Table SPM.2).
 – Limit to 2°C (>67%) or return warming to 1.5°C (>50%) after a high overshoot, NDCs until 2030: Pathways with GHG emissions until 2030 
associated with the implementation of NDCs announced prior to COP26, followed by accelerated emissions reductions likely to limit warming 
to 2°C (C3b, Table SPM.2) or to return warming to 1.5°C with a probability of 50% or greater after high overshoot (subset of 42 scenarios from 
C2, Table SPM.2).
 – Limit to 2°C (>67%) with immediate action: Pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) with immediate action after 2020 (C3a, Table SPM.2).
 – Limit to 1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot: Pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot (C1, Table SPM.2 C1). All 
these pathways assume immediate action after 2020.
Past GHG emissions for 2010–2015 used to project global warming outcomes of the modelled pathways are shown by a black line4 and past global 
GHG emissions in 2015 and 2019 as assessed in Chapter 2 are shown by whiskers.
Panels b, c and d show snapshots of the GHG emission ranges of the modelled pathways in 2030, 2050, and 2100, respectively. Panel b also 
shows projected emissions outcomes from near-term policy assessments in 2030 from Chapter 4.2 (Tables 4.2 and 4.3; median and full range). GHG 
emissions are in CO 2-equivalent using GWP100 from AR6 WGI. {3.5, 4.2, Table 4.2, Table 4.3, Cross-Chapter Box 4 in Chapter 4}
The NDCs are a central instrument of the PA to achieve its long-term goal. It thus combines a global goal with a country-driven 
(bottom-up) instrument to a hybrid climate policy architecture to strengthen the global response to climate change. All signatory 
countries committed to communicating nationally determined contributions including mitigation targets, every five years. While the 
NDCs mostly state targets, countries are also obliged to pursue domestic mitigation measures to achieve the objectives. The literature 
examines the emissions outcome of the range of policies implemented to reach these targets.
Emissions gap
A comparison between the projected emission outcomes of current policies, the NDCs (which include unconditional and conditional 
elements, Section 4.2.1) and mitigation pathways acting immediately, i.e. from 2020 onwards, on reaching different temperature 
goals in the long-term (Section  3.3.3) allows identifying different ‘emission gaps’ in 2030 (Cross-Chapter Box  4, Figure  1). First, 
the  implementation gap between ‘current policies’ and unconditional and conditional NDCs is estimated to be around 4  and 

NDCs and long-term mitigation pathways that limit warming to 2°C (>67%) or lower gives rise to a 2030 median emissions gap 
of 19–26  GtCO 2-eq (16–23  GtCO 2-eq) for limiting end-of-century warming to  1.5°C (>50%) with no or limited overshoot and  
10–16 GtCO 2-eq (6–14 GtCO 2-eq) for limiting warming to 2°C (>67%).5 GHG emissions of NDCs are broadly consistent with 2030 
emission levels of cost-effective long-term pathways staying below 2.5°C (scenarios category C5, Table 3.2, Chapter 3).
Other ‘gap indicators’
Beyond the quantification of different GHG emissions gaps, there is an emerging literature that identifies gaps between current 
policies, NDCs and long-term temperature in terms of other indicators, including for example the deployment of low-carbon energy 
sources, energy efficiency improvements, fossil fuel production levels or investments into mitigation measures (Roelfsema et al. 2020; 
McCollum et al. 2018; SEI et al. 2020).
A 2030 gap in the contribution of low-carbon energy sources to the energy mix in 2030 between current policies and cost-effective 
long-term temperature pathways is calculated to be around 7percentage-points (2°C) and 13percentage-points (1.5°C) by Roelfsema 
et al. (Roelfsema et al. 2020). The same authors estimate an energy intensity improvement gap 10% and 18% for 2030 between current 
policies pathways and 2°C and 1.5°C pathways, respectively. SEI et al. (2020) estimates the ‘fossil fuel production gap’, by which they 
mean ‘the level of countries’ planned fossil fuel production expressed in their carbon content to be 120% and 50% higher compared 
to the fossil fuel production consistent with 1.5°C and 2°C pathways, respectively, as assessed in IPCC SR1.5 (Rogelj et al. 2018a). 


and 2°C pathways.
4.2.3 Mitigation Efforts in Sub-national and Non-state 
Action Plans and Policies
The decision adopting the Paris Agreement stresses the importance 
of ‘stronger and more ambitious climate action’ by non-government 
and sub-national stakeholders, ‘including civil society, the private 
sector, financial institutions, cities and other sub-national authorities, 
local communities and indigenous peoples’ (UNFCCC 2015a). The 
Marrakech Partnership for Global Action, launched in the 2016 
UNFCCC Conference of Parties by two ‘high-level champions,’ further 
formalised the contributions of non-government and sub-national 
actors taking action through seven thematic areas (e.g.,  energy, 
human settlements, industry, land-use, etc.) and one cross-cutting 
area (resilience). Since then, non-state actors, for example, companies 
and civil society, and sub-national actors, such as cities and regions, 
have emerged to undertake a  range of largely voluntary carbon 
mitigation actions (Hsu et al. 2018, 2019) both as individual non-state 
actors (NSAs in the following) and through national and international 
cooperative initiatives, or ICIs (Hsu et al. 2018). ICIs take a variety of 
forms, ranging from those that focus solely on non-state actors to 
those that engage national and even local governments. They can 
also range in commitment level, from primarily membership-based 
initiatives that do not require specific actions to those that require members to tackle emissions reductions in specific sectors or aim for 
transformational change.
Quantification of the (potential) impact of these actions is still 
limited. Almost all studies estimate the potential impact of the 
implementation of actions by NSAs and ICIs, but do not factor in 
that they may not reach their targets. The main reason for this is that 
there is very limited data currently available from individual actors 
(e.g., annual GHG inventory reports) and initiatives to assess their 
progress towards their targets. A few studies have attempted to assess 
progress of initiatives by looking into the initiatives’ production of 
relevant outputs (Chan et al. 2018). Quantification does not yet cover 
all commitments and only a selected number of ICIs are analysed in 
the existing literature. Most of these studies exclude commitments 
that are not (self-)identified as related to climate change mitigation, 
those that are not connected to international networks, or those that 
are communicating in languages other than English.
Non state action could make significant contributions to achieving 
the Paris climate goals (limited evidence, high agreement). However, 
efforts to measure the extent to which non-state and sub-national 
actors go beyond national policy are still nascent (Hsu et al. 2019; 
Kuramochi et al. 2020) and we do not fully understand the extent Cross-Chapter Box 4 (continued)
The methodology used for this estimation is very similar to how emissions gaps are derived (SEI et al. 2019). The gap of global 
annual average investments in low-carbon energy and energy efficiency in 2030 between following current policy on the one 
hand and achieving the NDCs, the 2°C and 1.5°C targets on the other hand, is estimated to be approximately USD 130, 320, or 

It is important to note that such comparisons are less straight forward as the link between long-term temperature goals and these 
indicators is less pronounced compared to the emission levels themselves; they are therefore associated with greater uncertainty 
compared to the emissions gap.
Box 4.1 | Adaptation gap and NDCs
NDCs have been an important driver of national adaptation planning, with cascading effects on sectors and sub-national action, 
especially in developing countries. Yet, only 40 developing countries have quantifiable adaptation targets in their current NDCs; 

Working Group II contribution to this Assessment finds that the overall extent of adaptation-related responses in human systems is 
low (high confidence) and that there is limited evidence on the extent to which adaptation-related responses in human systems are 
reducing climate risk (O’Neill et al. 2020). Thus there is an adaptation gap (UNEP 2018a), and bridging that gap requires enablers 
including institutional capacity, planning and investment (UNEP 2016). Estimates of adaptation costs vary greatly across studies. Recent 
studies based on climate change under RCP8.5 report adaptation costs for developing countries of up to 400 billion (300 billion in 
RCP2.6) USD2005 in 2030 (New et al. 2020). Of the NDCs submitted in 2015, 50 countries estimated adaptation costs of USD39 billion 
annually. Both public and private finance for adaptation is increasing, but remains insufficient and constitutes a small fraction (4–8%) 
of total climate finance which is mostly aimed at mitigation. The pledge of developed countries of mobilising finance for developing 
countries to address adaptation needs globally as part of the Paris Agreement are insufficient. By 2030 the adaptation needs are 
expected to be three to six times larger than what is pledged, further increasing towards 2050 (UNEP 2016; New et al. 2020).

to which ambitious action by non-state actors is additional to what 
national governments intend to do. Sub-national and non-state 
climate action may also have benefits in reinforcing, implementing, 
or piloting national policy, in place of or in addition to achieving 
additional emissions reductions (Broekhoff et al. 2015; Heidrich et al. 
2016; Hsu et al. 2017).
Quantification of commitments by individual NSAs are limited 
to date. Attempts to quantify aggregate effects in 2030 of 
commitments by individual non-state and sub-national actors are 
reported by (Hsu et al. 2019; Kuramochi et al. 2020). Kuramochi 
et al. (2020) estimate potential mitigation by more than  1,600 
companies, around 6,000 cities and many regions (cities assessed 
have a  collective population of 579 million, and regions 514 
million). Individual commitments by these sub-national regions, 
cities and companies could reduce GHG emissions in 2030 by 1.2 
to 2.0 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 compared to current national policies scenario 
projections, reducing projected emissions by 3.8–5.5% in 2030, if 
commitments are fully implemented and do not lead to weaker 
mitigation actions by others (Figure 4.1 left). In several countries, 
NSA commitments could potentially help meet or exceed national 
mitigation targets.
Quantification of potential emission reductions from international 
cooperative initiatives have been assessed in several studies, and 
recently synthesised (Hsu et al. 2020; Lui et al. 2021), with some initiatives reporting high potential. In Table 4.4 and Figure 4.1, we 
report estimates of the emissions reductions from 19 distinct sub-
national and non-state initiatives to mitigate climate change. The 
table shows wide ranges of potential mitigation based on current, 
target or potential membership, as well as a  wide diversity of 
actors and membership assumptions. Current membership reflects 
the number of non-state or sub-national actors that are presently 
committed to a  particular initiative; while targeted or potential 
membership represents a  membership goal (e.g.,  increasing from 

et al. 2020). When adding up emission reduction potentials, sub-
national and non-state international cooperative initiatives could 
reduce up to about 20 Gt of CO 2-eq in 2030 (limited evidence, medium 
agreement). Chapter 8 also presents data on the savings potential of 
cities and it suggests that these could reach 2.3 GtCO 2-eq annually 
by 2030 and 4.2 GtCO 2-eq annually for 2050.
Non-state action may be broader than assessed in the literature 
so far, though subject to uncertainty. The examples in Table  4.4 
and Figure 4.1 do not include initiatives that target the emissions 
from religious organisations, colleges and universities, civic and 
cultural groups, and, to some extent, households, and in this sense 
may underestimate sub-national potential for mitigating emissions, 
rather than overestimate it. That said, the estimates are contingent 
on assumptions that sub-national and non-state actors achieve 
commitments – both with respect to mitigation and in some cases

Lui et al. (2020).
membership – and that these actions are not accounted for in nor 
lead to weakening of national actions.
Care is to be taken not to depict these efforts as additional to action 
within national NDCs, unless this is clearly established (Broekhoff 
et al. 2015). There are potential overlaps between individual NSAs 
and ICIs, and across ICIs. Kuramochi et al. (2020) propose partial 
and conservative partial effect methods to avoid double counting 
when comparing ambition, a matter that merits further attention. As 
the diversity of actions increased, the potential to count the same 
reductions multiple times increases.
Equally important to note here is that none of the studies reviewed 
in Figure  4.1 quantified the potential impact of financial sector 
actions, for example, divestment from emission intensive activities 
(Section 15.3 has a more detailed discussion of how financial actors 
and instruments are addressing climate change). Moreover, only 
a limited number of studies on the impact of actions by diverse actors 
go beyond 2050 (Table 4.4), which may reflect analysts’ recognition 
of the increasing uncertainties of longer time horizons. Accurate 
accounting methods can help to avoiding counting finance multiple 
times, and methods across mitigation and finance would consider 
counting carbon market flows and the tons reduced. As Table  4.4 
and Figure  4.1 indicate, activities by businesses have potential to 
significantly contribute to global mitigation efforts. For example, 
the SBTi (Science Based Targets initiative) encourages companies to 
pledge to reduce their emissions at rates which according to SBTi 
would be compatible with global pathways to well below 2°C or 1.5°C, 
with various methodologies being proposed (Andersen et al. 2021; 
Faria and Labutong 2019). Readers may note, however, that the link 
between emissions by individual actors and long-term temperature 
goals cannot be inferred without additional assumptions (Box 4.2). In 
the energy sector, some voluntary initiatives are also emerging to stop 
methane emissions associated with oil and gas supply chains. The Oil 
and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) is a voluntary initiative lead 
by the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, which has recently published 
a  comprehensive framework for methane detection, measurement 
and reporting (UNEP 2020b).
Initiatives made up of cities and sub-national regions have an 
especially large potential to reduce emissions, due to their inclusion 
of many actors, across a range of different geographic regions, with 
ambitious emissions reduction targets, and these actors’ coverage of 
a large share of emissions (Kuramochi et al. 2020). Hsu et al. (2019) 
find largest potential in that area. Several sub-national regions like 
California and Scotland have set zero emission targets (Höhne et al. 
2019), supported by short- and medium-term interim goals (Scottish 
Government 2020b; State of California 2018). Sharing of effort across 
global and sub-global scales has not been quantified, though one 
study suggests that non-state actors have increasingly adopted 
more diverse framings, including vulnerability, human rights and 
transformational framings of justice (Shawoo and McDermott 2020). 
Initiatives focused on forestry have high emissions reduction potential 
due to the current high deforestation rates, and due to the ambitious 
targets of many of these forestry initiatives, such as the New York 
Declaration on Forests’ goal to end deforestation by 2030 (Höhne 
et al. 2019; Lui et al. 2021), although the Initiative acknowledges that insufficient progress has to-date been made towards this goal 
(NYDF Assessment Partners 2020). On the other hand, uncertainties 
in global forest carbon emissions (and therefore potential reductions) 
are high and despite a multitude of initiatives in the sector, actually 
measured deforestation rates have not declined since the initiative 
was announced in 2014 (Sections 7.2 and 7.3.1). Moreover, not all 
initiatives are transparent about how they plan to reach their goals 
and may also rely on offsets.
Initiatives focused on non-CO2 emissions, and particularly on 
methane, can achieve sizable reductions, in the order of multiple 
GtCO 2-eq yr–1 (Table  4.4). The Global Cement and Concrete 
Association (formerly the Cement Sustainability Initiative), has 
contributed to the development of consistent energy and emissions 
reporting from member companies. The CSI also suggested 
possible approaches to balance GHG mitigation and the issues of 
competitiveness and leakage (Cook and Ponssard 2011). The member 
companies of the GCCA (CSI) have become better prepared for future 
legislation on managing GHG emissions and developed management 
competence to respond to climate change compared to non-member 
companies in the cement sector (Busch et al. 2008; Global Cement 
and Concrete Association 2020). Accordingly, the cement industry 
has developed some roadmaps to reach net zero GHG around 2050 
(Sanjuán et al. 2020).
It is also important to note that individual NSAs and ICIs that commit 
to GHG mitigation activities are often scarce in many crucial and 
‘hard-to-abate’ sectors, such as iron and steel, cement and freight 
transport (Chapters 10 and 11). Sub-national and non-state action 
efforts could help these sectors meet an urgent need to accelerate 
the commercialisation and uptake of technical options to achieve low 
zero emissions (Bataille 2020).
4.2.4 Mid-century Low-emission Strategies 
at the National Level
An increasing amount of literature describes mitigation pathways 
for the mid-term (up to 2050). We assess literature reflecting on the 
UNFCCC process (Section 4.2.4.1), other official plans and strategies 
(Section  4.2.4.2) and academic literature on mid-century low-
emission pathways at the national level (Section 4.2.4.3). After the 
Paris Agreement and the IPCC SR1.5 Report, the number of academic 
papers analysing domestic emission pathways compatible with 
the 1.5°C limit has been increasing. Governments have developed 
an increasing number of mitigation strategies up to 2050. Several 
among these strategies aim at net zero CO 2 or net zero GHG, but it is 
not yet possible to draw global implications due to the limited size of 
sample (limited evidence, limited agreement).
4.2.4.1 GHG Mitigation Target Under UNFCCC 
and Paris Agreement
The Paris Agreement requests that Parties should strive to formulate 
and communicate long-term low GHG development strategies by 
2020. (Note that by ‘long-term’, the UNFCCC means 2050, which is 
the end point of the ‘mid-term’ horizon range in the present report.) 

‘carbon neutrality’; the more precise terms are used where supported by the information assessed in this report.As of August 25, 2021, 31 countries and the European Union had 
submitted low-emissions development strategies (LEDS) (Table 4.5).
By 2018, most long-term strategies targeted 80% emissions reduction 
in 2050 relative to a reference (1990, 2000 or 2005). After IPCC SR1.5 
was published, the number of the countries aiming at net zero CO 2 or 
GHG emissions has been increasing.6Box 4.2 | Direct Links Between an Individual Actor’s Mitigation Efforts in the Near Term and 
Global Temperature Goals in the Long Term Cannot be Inferred: Making direct links requires 
clear distinctions of spatial and temporal scales (Robertson 2021; Rogelj et al. 2021) and 
explicit treatment of ethical judgements made (Klinsky et al. 2017a; Holz et al. 2018; Klinsky 
and Winkler 2018; Rajamani et al. 2021)
The literature frequently refers to national mitigation pathways up to 2030 or 2050 using long-term temperature limits in the Paris 
Agreement (i.e., ‘2°C’ or ‘1.5°C scenario’). Without additional information, such denomination is incorrect. Working Group I reaffirmed 
‘with high confidence the AR5 finding that there is a near-linear relationship between cumulative anthropogenic CO 2 emissions and 
the global warming they cause’ (WGI SPM AR6). It is not the function of any single country’s mitigation efforts, nor any individual 
actor’s. Emission pathways of individual countries or sectors in the near to mid-term can only be linked to a long-term temperature 
with additional assumptions specifying (i) the GHG emissions and removals of other countries up the mid-term; and (ii) the GHG 
emissions and removals of all countries beyond the near and mid-term. For example, a national mitigation pathway can be labelled 
‘2°C compatible’ if it derives from a global mitigation pathway consistent with 2°C via an explicit effort sharing scheme across 
countries (Sections 4.2.2.6 and 4.5).

4.2.4.2 Other National Emission Pathways to Mid-century
At the 2019 Climate Action Summit, 77 countries indicated their 
aim to reach net zero CO 2 emissions by 2050, more the number 
of countries having submitted LEDS to the UNFCCC. Table 4.6 lists 
the countries that have a national net zero by 2050 target in laws, 
strategies or other documents (The Energy and Climate Intelligence 
Unit 2019). Bhutan and Suriname already have achieved net negative 
emissions. France second ‘low-carbon national strategy’ adopted in 

basis of the recent revision of the official notional price of carbon for 
public investment in France (Quinet et al. 2019). The Committee on 
Climate Change of the UK analyses sectoral options and concludes 
that delivering net zero GHG by 2050 is technically feasible but 
highly challenging (Committee on Climate Change 2019). For 
Germany, three steps to climate neutrality by 2050 are introduced: 
first, a  65% reduction of emissions by 2030; second, a  complete 
switch to climate-neutral technologies, leading to a  95% cut in 
emissions, all relative to 1990 levels by 2050; and third balancing 
of residual emissions through carbon capture and storage (Prognos 
et al. 2020). In addition to the countries in Table 4.6, EU reported 
the net zero GHG emission pathways by 2050 under Green Deal 
(European Commission 2019). China and South Korea, have made 
announcements of carbon neutrality before 2060 and net zero GHG 
emission by 2050, respectively (UN 2020a,b). In the case of Japan, 
the new target to net zero GHG emission by 2050 was announced 
in 2020 (UN 2020c). As of August 25, 2021, a total 121 countries 
participate in the ‘Climate Ambition Alliance: Net Zero 2050’, 
together with businesses, cities and regions.Country Date submitted GHG reduction target

4.2.4.3 Mid-century Low Emission Strategies at the National 
Level in the Academic Literature
Since the 2000s, an increasing number of studies have quantified 
the emission pathways to mid-century by using national scale 
models. In the early stages, the national emission pathways were 
mainly assessed in the developed countries such as Germany, UK, 
France, the Netherlands, Japan, Canada, and USA. For example, the 
Enquete Commission in Germany identified robust and sustainable 
80% emission reduction pathways (Deutscher Bundestag 2002). In 
Japan, 2050 Japan Low-Carbon Society scenario team (2008) assessed 
the 70% reduction scenarios in Japan, and summarised the necessary 
measures to ‘Dozen Actions towards Low-Carbon Societies’.
Among developing countries, China, India, South Africa assessed 
their national emission pathways. For example, detailed analysis was 
undertaken to analyse pathways to China’s goal for carbon neutrality 
(EFC 2020). In South Africa, a  Scenario Building Team (2007) 
quantified the Long Term Mitigation Scenarios for South Africa.
Prior to COP21, most of the literature on mid-century mitigation 
pathways at the national level was dedicated to pathways compatible 
with a  2°C limit (see Box  4.2 for a  discussion on the relationship 
between national mitigation pathways and global, long-term targets). 
After COP21 and the IPCC SR1.5, literature increasingly explored just 
transition to net zero emissions around 2050. This literature reflects 
on low-emissions development strategies (cognate with SDPS, 
Section 4.3.1) and policies to get to net zero CO 2 or GHG emissions 
(Garg and Waisman 2021) (Cross-Chapter Box 5 in this chapter).Figure 4.2 provides a snapshot of this literature. For a selected set of 
countries, it shows the mid-century emission pathways at national 
scale that have been registered in the International Institute for 
Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) national mitigation scenario 
database built for the purpose of this Report (Annex III.3.3). Overall, 
the database contains scenarios for 50 countries. Total GHG emission 
are the most comprehensive information to assess the pathways on 
climate mitigation actions, but energy-related CO 2 emissions are the 
most widely populated data in the scenarios. As a result, Figure 4.2 
shows energy-related CO 2 emission trajectories. Scenarios for EU 
countries show reduction trends even in the reference scenario, 
whereas developing countries and non-European developed 
countries such as Japan and USA show emissions increase in the 
reference. In most countries plotted on Figure  4.2, studies have 
found that reaching net zero energy related CO 2 emissions by 2050 is 
feasible, although the number of such pathways is limited.
The literature underlines the differences induced by the shift from 
‘2°C scenarios’ (typically assumed to imply mitigation in 2050 
around 80% relative to 1990) to ‘1.5°C scenarios’ (typically assumed 
to imply net zero CO 2 or GHG emissions in 2050) (Box 4.2). For Japan, 
Oshiro et al. (2018) shows the difference between the implications of 
a 2°C scenario (80% reduction of CO 2 in 2050) and a 1.5°C scenario 
(net zero CO 2 emission in 2050), suggesting that for a net zero CO 2 
emission scenario, BECCS is a key technology. Their sectoral analysis 
aims in 2050 at negative CO 2 emissions in the energy sector, and 
near-zero emissions in the buildings and transport sectors, requiring 
energy efficiency improvement and electrification. To do so, drastic 
mitigation is introduced immediately, and, as a result, the mitigation

MAPS (Mitigation Action Plans and Scenarios)The mitigation potential and socio-economic implications in Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru were assessed (Delgado et al. 
2014; Zevallos et al. 2014; Benavides et al. 2015; La Rovere et al. 2018). The experiences of the MAPS programme suggests that 
co-production of knowledge by researchers and stakeholders strengthens the impact of research findings, and in depth studies of 
stakeholder engagement provide lessons (Boulle et al. 2015; Raubenheimer et al. 2015; Kane and Boulle 2018), which can assist 
building capacity for long-term planning in other contexts (Calfucoy et al. 2019).
CD-LINKS (Linking Climate and Development 
Policies – Leveraging International Networks 
and Knowledge Sharing)The complex interplay between climate action and development at both the global scale and some national perspectives were 
explored. The climate policies for G20 countries up to 2015 and some levels of the carbon budget are assessed for short-term 
and long-term, respectively (Rogelj et al. 2017).
APEC Energy Demand and Supply OutlookTotal 21 APEC countries assessed a 2°C scenario scenario which follows the carbon emissions reduction pathway included  
in the IEA Energy Technology Perspectives (IEA 2017) by using the common framework (APERC 2019).
Low-Carbon Asia Research ProjectThe low-carbon emission scenarios for several countries and cities in Asia were assessed by using the same framework (Matsuoka 
et al. 2013). The mitigation activities were summarised into 10 actions toward Low Carbon Asia to show a guideline to plan and 
implement the strategies for an LCS in Asia (Low-Carbon Asia Research Project 2012).

Strategies)This is an international research project which covers five countries and one region in order to build capacity and knowledge on 
low-emissions development strategies both at a national and global level, by investigating the concrete implications of INDCs for 
the low-carbon transformation by and beyond 2030 (Spencer et al. 2015).
target of Japan’s current NDC is considered not sufficient to achieve 
a 1.5°C scenario. Jiang et al. (2018) also show the possibility of net 
negative emissions in the power sector in China by 2050, indicating 
that biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (CCS) must be 
adopted on a large scale by 2040. Samadi et al. (2018) indicate the 
widespread use of electricity-derived synthetic fuels in end-use sectors 
as well as behavioural change for the 1.5°C scenario in Germany.In addition to those analyses, Vishwanathan et al. (2018b), Chunark 
and Limmeechokchai (2018) and Pradhan et al. (2018b) build national 
scenarios in India, Thailand and Nepal, respectively, compatible 
with a global 1.5°C. Unlike the studies mentioned in the previous 
paragraph, they translate the 1.5°C goal by introducing in their model 
a carbon price trajectory estimated by global models as sufficient to 
achieve the 1.5°C target. Because of the high economic growth and

increase of GHG emissions in the reference case, CO 2 emissions in 

to achieve a 1.5°C target, mitigation measures relative to non-CO 2 
emissions become important, especially in developing countries 
where the share of non-CO 2 emissions is relatively high. (La Rovere 
et al. 2018) treat mitigation actions in AFOLU sector.
Chapter 3 reported on multi-model analyses, comparison of results 
using different models, of global emissions in the long term. At the 
national scale, multi-model analyses are still limited, though such 
analyses are growing as shown in Table 4.7. By comparing the results 
among different models and different scenarios in a  country, the 
uncertainties on the emission pathways including the mitigation 
measures to achieve a given emission target can be assessed.
Another type of multi-model analysis is international, in other 
words, different countries join the same project and use their own 
national models to assess a  pre-agreed joint mitigation scenario. 
By comparing the results of various national models, such projects 
help highlight specific features of each country. More robust 
mitigation measures can be proposed if different types of models 
participate. These activities can also contribute to capacity building 
in developing countries.
4.2.5 What Is to Be Done to Accelerate Mitigation?
4.2.5.1 Overview of Accelerated Mitigation Pathways
The literature reports an increasing number of accelerated mitigation 
pathways that are beyond NDCs in different regions and countries. 
There is increasing understanding of the technical content of such 
pathways, though the literature remains limited on some dimensions, 
such as demand-side options, systems analysis, or mitigation of 
AFOLU non-CO 2 GHGs. The present section describes insights from 
this literature.
Overall, the literature shows that pathways considered consistent 
with below 2°C (>67%) or 1.5°C (Box 4.2) – including inter alia 
80% reduction of GHG emissions in 2050 relative to 1990 or 
100% renewable electricity scenarios  – are technically feasible 
(Lund and Mathiesen 2009; Mathiesen et al. 2011; Esteban and 
Portugal-Pereira 2014; Young and Brans 2017; Esteban et al. 2018; 
Child et al. 2019; Hansen et al. 2019). They entail increased end-
use energy efficiency, significant increases in low-carbon energy, 
electrification, other new and transformative technologies in 
demand sectors, adoption of carbon capture and sequestration 
(CCS) to reduce gross emissions, and contribution to net negative 
emissions through carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and carbon sinks. 
For these pathways to be realised, the literature assumes higher 
carbon prices, combined in policy packages with a range of other 
policy measures.
The most recent literature also reflects on accelerated mitigation 
pathways aiming at reaching net zero CO 2 emissions or net zero 
GHG emissions by 2050 (Section 4.2.4 and Table 4.6; see Glossary 
entries on ‘net zero CO 2 emissions’ and ‘net zero GHG emissions’). Specific policies, measures and technologies are needed to reach 
such targets. These include, broadly, decarbonising electricity supply, 
including through low-carbon energy, radically more efficient use of 
energy than today; electrification of end-uses (including transport/
electric vehicles); dramatically lower use of fossil fuels than today; 
converting other uses to low- or zero-carbon fuels (e.g., hydrogen, 
bioenergy, ammonia) in hard-to-decarbonise sectors; and setting 
ambitious targets to reduce methane and other short-lived climate 
forcers (SLCFs).
Accelerated mitigation pathways differ by countries, depending inter 
alia on sources of emissions, mitigation opportunities and economic 
context. In China, India, Japan and other Southeast Asian countries, 
more aggressive action related to climate change is also motivated 
by regional concerns over health and air quality related to air 
pollutants and SLCFs (Ashina et al. 2012; Aggarwal 2017; Kuramochi 
et al. 2017; Xunzhang et al. 2017; Dhar et al. 2018; Jiang et al. 2018; 
Oshiro et al. 2018; China National Renewable Energy Centre 2019; 
Energy Transitions Commission and Rocky Mountain Institute 2019; 
Khanna et al. 2019). Studies of accelerated mitigation pathways 
in North America tend to focus on power sector and imported fuel 
decarbonisation in the US , and on electrification and demand-side 
reductions in Canada (Vaillancourt et al. 2017; Hodson et al. 2018; 
Victor et al. 2018; Bahn and Vaillancourt 2020; Hammond et al. 2020; 
Jayadev et al. 2020). In Latin America, many pathways emphasise 
supply-side mitigation measures, finding that replacing thermal 
power generation and developing bioenergy (where resources are 
available) utilisation offers the greatest mitigation opportunities 
(Herreras Martínez et al. 2015; Nogueira de Oliveira et al. 2016; 
Arango-Aramburo et al. 2019; Delgado et al. 2020; Lap et al. 2020). 
The European Union member states (EU-28) recently announced 

complete substitution of fossil fuels with electricity generated by 
low-carbon sources, particularly renewables; demand reductions 
through efficiency and conservation, and novel fuels and end-use 
technologies (Prognos et al. 2020). The limited literature so far on 
Africa’s future pathways suggest those could be shaped by increasing 
energy access and mitigating the air pollution and health effects 
of relying on traditional biomass use, as well as cleaner expansion of 
power supply alongside end-use efficiency improvements (Hamilton 
and Kelly 2017; Oyewo et al. 2019, 2020; Ven et al. 2019; Wright et al. 
2019; Forouli et al. 2020).
Though they differ across countries, accelerated mitigation pathways 
share common characteristics as follows. First, energy  efficiency, 
conservation, and reducing energy use in all energy demand 
sectors (buildings, transport, and industry) are included in nearly 
all literature that addresses future demand growth (Ashina et al. 
2012; Saveyn et al. 2012; Schmid and Knopf 2012; Chiodi et al. 2013; 
Deetman et al. 2013; Jiang et al. 2013; Thepkhun et al. 2013; Schiffer 
2015; Altieri et al. 2016; Jiang et al. 2016; McNeil et al. 2016; 
Nogueira de Oliveira et al. 2016; Chilvers et al. 2017; Elizondo et al. 
2017; Fragkos et al. 2017; Jacobson et al. 2017, 2019; Kuramochi 
et al. 2017; Oshiro et al. 2017a; Ouedraogo 2017; Shahiduzzaman 
and Layton 2017; Vaillancourt et al. 2017; Hanaoka and Masui 2018; 
Hodson et al. 2018; Lee et al. 2018; Lefèvre et al. Oshiro et al. 2018; 
2018; Capros et al. 2019; Dioha et al. 2019; Duscha et al. 2019;  
Khanna et al. 2019; Kato and Kurosawa 2019; Nieves et al. 2019; 
Sugiyama et al. 2019; Zhou et al. 2019; Dioha and Kumar 2020).
Similarly, electrification of industrial processes (up to 50% for EU and 
China) and transport (e.g., 30–60% for trucks in Canada), buildings, 
and district heating and cooling are commonplace (Ashina et al. 2012; 
Massetti 2012; Saveyn et al. 2012; Chiodi et al. 2013; Deetman et al. 
2013; Fragkos et al. 2017; Oshiro et al. 2017b; Vaillancourt et al. 2017; 
Xunzhang et al. 2017; Jiang et al. 2018; Mittal et al. 2018; Oshiro et al. 
2018; Capros et al. 2019; Zhou et al. 2019; Hammond et al. 2020).
Third, lower emissions sources of energy, such as nuclear, renewables, 
and some biofuels, are seen as necessary in all pathways. However, 
the extent of deployment depends on resource availability. Some 
countries have set targets of up to 100% renewable electricity, while 
others such as Brazil rely on increasing biomass up to 40–45% of 
total or industry energy consumption by 2050.
Fourth, CCS and CDR are part of many of the national studies reviewed 
(Ashina et al. 2012; Massetti 2012; Jiang et al. 2013; Thepkhun 
et al. 2013; Herreras Martínez et al. 2015; van der Zwaan et al. 
2016; Chilvers et al. 2017; Solano Rodriguez et al. 2017; Xunzhang 
et al. 2017; Kuramochi et al. 2018; Mittal et al. 2018; Oshiro et al. 
2018; Roberts et al. 2018b; Vishwanathan et al. 2018b; Kato and 
Kurosawa 2019). CCS helps reduce gross emissions but does not 
remove CO 2 from the atmosphere, unless combined with bioenergy 
(BECCS). CO 2 removal from sources with no identified mitigation 
measures is considered necessary to help achieve economy-wide 
net negative emissions (Massetti 2012; Deetman et al. 2013; Solano 
Rodriguez et al. 2017).
Each option is assessed in more detail in the following sections.4.2.5.2 Accelerated Decarbonisation of Electricity Through 
Renewable Energy
Power generation could decarbonise much faster with scaled up 
deployment of renewable energy and storage. Both technologies are 
mature, available, and fast decreasing in costs, more than for many 
other mitigation options. Models continuously underestimate the 
speed at which renewables and storage expand. Higher penetration of 
renewable energy in the power sector is a common theme in scenarios. 
Some studies provide cost optimal electricity mix under emission 
constraints, while others explicitly explore a  100%  renewables or 
100% emission free electricity sector (Box 4.3).
Figure  4.3 shows an increasing share of renewable electricity in 
most countries historically, with further increases projected in many 
decarbonisation pathways. Targets for very high shares of renewable 
electricity generation – up to 100% – are shown for a number of 
countries, with the global share projected to range from 60% to 
70% for 1.5°C with no overshoot (C0) to below 2°C (C4) scenarios. 
Countries and states that have set 100% renewables targets include 
Scotland for 2020 (Scottish Government 2021), Austria (2030), 
Denmark (2035) and California (2045) (Figure 4.3).
While 100% renewable electricity generation by 2050 is found 
to be feasible, it is not without issues. For example, (Jacobson 
et al. 2017, 2019) find it feasible for 143 countries with only a 9% 
average increase in economic costs (considering all social costs) if 
annual electricity demand can be reduced by 57%. Others state that 
challenges exist with speed of expansion, ensuring sufficient supply 
at all times or higher costs compared to other alternatives (Clack 
et al. 2017). In-depth discussion of net zero electricity systems can be 
found in Section 6.6.
Box 4.3 | Examples of High-renewable Accelerated Mitigation Pathways
Many accelerated mitigation pathways include high shares of renewable energy, with national variations. In Europe, some argue 
that the EU 2050 net zero GHG emissions goal can be met with 100% renewable power generation, including use of renewable 
electricity to produce hydrogen, biofuels (including imports), and synthetic hydrocarbons, but will require significant increases in 
transmission capacity (Duscha et al. 2019; Zappa et al. 2019). Capros et al. (2019) explore a 1.5°C compatible pathway that includes 
85% renewable generation, with battery, pumped hydro, and chemical storage for variable renewables. High-renewable scenarios 
also exist for individual Member States. In France, for example, Krakowski et al. (2016) propose a 100% renewable power generation 
scenario that relies primarily on wind (62%), solar PV (26%) and oceans (12%). To reach this aim, integration into the European grid is 
of vital importance (Brown et al. 2018). While debated, incremental costs could be limited regardless of specific assumptions of future 
costs of individual technologies (Shirizadeh et al. 2020). In Germany, similarly, 100% renewable electricity systems are found feasible 
by numerous studies (Oei et al. 2020; Thomas Klaus et al. 2010; Wuppertal-Institut 2021; Hansen et al. 2019).
In South Africa, it is found that long-term mitigation goals could be achieved with accelerated adoption of solar PV and wind 
generation, if the electricity sector decarbonises by phasing-out coal entirely by 2050, even if CCS is not feasible before 2025 (Altieri 
et al. 2015; Beck et al. 2013). Abundant solar PV and wind potential, coupled with land availability suggest that more than 75% of 
power generation could ultimately originate from solar PV and wind (Oyewo et al. 2019; Wright et al. 2019).
For the US, share of renewables in power generation in 2050 in accelerated mitigation scenarios vary widely, 40% in (Hodson et al. 
2018; Jayadev et al. 2020), more than half renewable and nuclear in (Victor et al. 2018) to 100% in Jacobson et al. (2017, 2019).
Box 4.3 (continued)
Under cost optimisation scenarios for Brazil, electricity generation, which is currently dominated by hydropower, could reach 100% 
by adding biomass (Köberle et al. 2020). Other studies find that renewable energy, including biomass, could account for more than 
30% of total electricity generation (Nogueira de Oliveira et al. 2016; Portugal-Pereira et al. 2016).
In Colombia, where hydropower resources are abundant and potential also exist for solar and wind, a deep decarbonisation pathway 
would require 57% renewable power generation by 2050 (Arango-Aramburo et al. 2019) while others find 80% would be possible 
(Delgado et al. 2020).
In Asia, Japan could have up to 50% variable renewable electricity supply to reduce CO 2 emissions by 80% by 2050 in some of 
its deep mitigation scenarios ( Kato and Kurosawa 2019; Sugiyama et al. 2019; Ju et al. 2021; Shiraki et al. 2021; Silva Herran and 
Fujimori 2021). One view of China’s 1.5°C pathway includes 59% renewable power generation by 2050 (Jiang et al. 2018). One view 
of India’s 1.5°C pathway also includes 52% renewable power generation, and would require storage needs for 35% of generation 
(Parikh et al. 2018).

4.2.5.3 Bioenergy Plays Significant Role in Resource Abundant 
Countries in Latin America and Parts of Europe
Bioenergy could account for up to 40% of Brazil’s total final energy 
consumption, and a  60% share of fuel for light-duty vehicles by 

in transport and industrial applications (Lap et al. 2020). BECCS in 
the power sector is also considered cost-effective option for supply-
side mitigation (Borba et al. 2012; Herreras Martínez et al. 2015; 
Lucena et al. 2016).
Bioenergy also plays a prominent role in some EU countries’ deep 
decarbonisation strategies. Domestic biomass alone can help 
Germany meet its 95% CO 2 reduction by 2050 goal, and biomass 
and CCS together are needed to reduce CO 2 by 80% by 2050 in the 
Netherlands (Mikova et al. 2019). Studies suggest that mitigation 
efforts in France include biofuels and significant increases in biomass 
use, including up to 45% of industry energy by 2050 for its net GHG 
neutrality goal (Doumax-Tagliavini and Sarasa 2018; Capros et al. 
2019). Increased imports may be needed to meet significant increases 
in EU’s bioenergy use, which could affect energy security and the 
sustainability of bioenergy production outside of the EU (Mandley 
et al. 2020; Daioglou et al. 2020).
While BECCS is needed in multiple accelerated mitigation pathways, 
large-scale land-based biological CDR may not prove as effective as 
expected, and its large-scale deployment may result in ecological 
and social impacts, suggesting it may not be a viable carbon removal 
strategy in the next 10–20 years (Vaughan and Gough 2016; Boysen 
et al. 2017; Dooley and Kartha 2018). The effectiveness of BECCS 
could depend on local contexts, choice of biomass, fate of initial 
aboveground biomass and fossil-fuel emissions offsets  – carbon 
removed through BECCS could be offset by losses due to land-use 
change (Harper et al. 2018; Butnar et al. 2020; Calvin et al. 2021). 
Large-scale BECCS may push planetary boundaries for freshwater use, 
exacerbate land-system change, significantly alter biosphere integrity 
and biogeochemical flows (Heck et al. 2018; Fuhrman et al. 2020; 
Stenzel et al. 2021; Ai et al. 2021). (Sections 7.4 and 12.5) 
4.2.5.4 CCS May Be Needed to Mitigate Emissions From the 
Remaining Fossil Fuels That Cannot Be Decarbonised, 
but the Economic Feasibility of Deployment 
Is Not Yet Clear
CCS is present in many accelerated mitigation scenarios in the 
literature. In Brazil, (Nogueira de Oliveira et al. 2016) consider 
BECCS and CCS in hydrogen generation more feasible than CCS in 
thermal power plants, with costs ranging from USD70–100 per tCO 2. 
Overall, (van der Zwaan et al. 2016) estimate that 33–50% of total 
electricity generation in Latin America could be ultimately covered 
by CCS. In Japan, CCS and increased bioenergy adoption plus waste-
to-energy and hydrogen-reforming from fossil fuel are all considered 
necessary in the power sector in existing studies, with potential up 
to 200 MtCO 2 yr–1 (Ashina et al. 2012; Oshiro et al. 2017a; Kato 
and Kurosawa 2019; Sugiyama et al. 2021). In parts of the EU, 
after 2030, CCS could become profitable with rising CO 2 prices 
(Schiffer 2015). CDR is seen as necessary in some net GHG neutrality pathways (Capros et al. 2019) but evidence on cost-effectiveness is 
scarce and uncertain (European Commission 2013). For France and 
Sweden, (Millot et al. 2020) include CCS and BECCS to meet net zero 
GHG emissions by 2050. For Italy, (Massetti 2012) propose a zero-
emission electricity scenario with a combination of renewable and 
coal, natural gas, and BECCS.
In China, an analysis concluded that CCS is necessary for remaining 
coal and natural gas generation out to 2050 (Jiang et al. 2018; Energy 
Transitions Commission and Rocky Mountain Institute 2019). Seven 
to 10 CCS projects with installed capacity of 15 GW by 2020 and 
total CCS investment of 105 billion RMB (2010 RMB) are projected 
to be needed by 2050 under a 2°C compatible pathway according to 
(Jiang et al. 2013, 2016; Lee et al. 2018). Under 1.5°C pathway, an 
analysis found China would need full CCS coverage of the remaining 
12% of power generation from coal and gas power and 250 GW of 
BECCS (Jiang et al. 2018). Combined with expanded renewable and 
nuclear development, total estimated investment in this study is 5% 
of China’s total GDP in 2020,  1.3% in 2030, and  0.6% in 2050 
(Jiang et al. 2016).
Views regarding feasibility of CCS can vary greatly for the same 
country. In the case of India’s electricity sector for instance, some 
studies indicate that CCS would be necessary (Vishwanathan et al. 
2018a), while others do not – citing concerns around its feasibility 
due to limited potential sites and issues related to socio-political 
acceptance  – and rather point to very ambitious increase in 
renewable energy, which in turn could pose significant challenges 
in systematically integrating renewable energy into the current 
energy systems (Viebahn et al. 2014; Mathur and Shekhar 2020). 
Some limitations of CCS, including uncertain costs, lifecycle and net 
emissions, other biophysical resource needs, and social acceptance 
are acknowledged in existing studies (Viebahn et al. 2014; Jacobson 
2019; Mathur and Shekhar 2020; Sekera and Lichtenberger 2020).
While national mitigation portfolios aiming at net zero emissions 
or lower will need to include some level of CDR, the choice of 
methods and the scale and timing of their deployment will depend 
on the ambition for gross emission reductions, how sustainability and 
feasibility constraints are managed, and how political preferences 
and social acceptability evolve (Cross-Chapter Box 8). Furthermore, 
mitigation deterrence may create further uncertainty, as anticipated 
future CDR could dilute incentives to reduce emissions now (Grant 
et al. 2021), and the political economy of net negative emissions has 
implications for equity (Mohan et al. 2021).
4.2.5.5 Nuclear Power Is Considered Strategic for Some 
Countries, While Others Plan to Reach Their Mitigation 
Targets Without Additional Nuclear Power
Nuclear power generation is developed in many countries, though 
larger-scale national nuclear generation does not tend to associate 
with significantly lower carbon emissions (Sovacool et al. 2020). 
Unlike other energy sources such as wind and PV solar, levelised 
costs of nuclear power has been rising in the last decades (Grubler 
2010; Gilbert et al. 2017; Portugal-Pereira et al. 2018). This is mainly 
due to overrun of overnight construction costs related to delays in 
project approvals and construction, and more stringent passive 
safety measures, which increases the complexity of systems. After 
the Fukushima Daiichi accident in Japan, nuclear programs in several 
countries have been phased out or cancelled (Carrara 2020; Huenteler 
et al. 2012; Kharecha and Sato 2019; Hoffman and Durlak 2018). 
Also the compatibility of conventional prresurised water reactors and 
boiling water reactors with large proportion of renewable energy in 
the grid it is yet to be fully understood.
Accelerated mitigation scenarios offer contrasting views on the 
share of nuclear in power generation. In the USA, (Victor et al. 2018) 
build a scenario in which nuclear contributes 23% of CO 2 emission 
reductions needed to reduce GHG emissions by 80% from 2005 levels 
by 2050. Deep power sector decarbonisation pathways could require 
a two-folded increase in nuclear capacity according to (Jayadev et al. 
2020) for the USA, and nearly a ten-fold increase for Canada, but 
may be difficult to implement (Vaillancourt et al. 2017). For China to 
meet a 1.5°C pathway or achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, nuclear 
may represent 14–28% of power generation in 2050 according to 
(Jiang et al. 2018; China National Renewable Energy Centre 2019; 
Energy Transitions Commission and Rocky Mountain Institute 2019). 
For South Korea, Hong et al. (2014) and Hong and Brook (2018) find 
that increasing nuclear power can help complement renewables in 
decarbonising the grid. Similarly, India has put in place a three-stage 
nuclear programme which aims to enhance nuclear power capacity 
from the current level of 6  GW to 63 GW by 2032, if fuel supply 
is ensured (GoI 2015). Nuclear energy is also considered necessary 
as part of accelerated mitigation pathways in Brazil, although it is 
not expected to increase significantly by 2050 even under stringent 
low-carbon scenarios (Lucena et al. 2016). France developed its 
nuclear strategy in response to energy security concerns after the 
1970s oil crisis, but has committed to reducing nuclear’s share of 
power generation to 50% by 2035 (Millot et al. 2020). Conversely, 
some analysis find deep mitigation pathways, including net zero GHG 
emissions and 80–90% reduction from 2013 levels, feasible without 
additional nuclear power in EU-28 and Japan respectively, but 
assuming a combination of bio- and novel fuels and CCS or land-use 
based carbon sinks (Kato and Kurosawa 2019; Duscha et al. 2019).
Radically more efficient use of energy than today, including electricity, 
is a complementary set of measures, explored in the following.
4.2.5.6 Efficient Cooling, SLCFs and Co-benefits
In warmer climate regions undergoing economic transitions, 
improving the energy efficiency of cooling and refrigeration equipment 
is often important for managing peak electricity demand and can 
have co-benefits for climate mitigation as well as SLCF reduction, as 
expected in India, Africa, and Southeast Asia in the future.
Air conditioner adoption is rising significantly in low- and middle-
income countries as incomes rise and average temperatures increase, 
including in Southeast Asian countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, 
Vietnam, and the Philippines, as well as Brazil, Pakistan, Bangladesh, 
and Nigeria (Biardeau et al. 2020). Cooling appliances are expected 
to increase from  3.6 billion to  9.5 billion by 2050, though up to 

not sufficient to deliver universal access to cooling or meet the 2030 
targets under the SDGs, but energy efficiency, including in equipment 
efficiency like air conditioners, can reduce this demand and help limit 
additional emissions that would further exacerbate climate change 
(Biardeau et al. 2020; Dreyfus et al. 2020; UNEP and IEA 2020). Some 
countries (India, South Africa) have started to recognise the need for 
more efficient equipment in their mitigation strategies (Altieri et al. 
2016; Ouedraogo 2017; Paladugula et al. 2018).
One possible synergy between SLCF and climate change mitigation 
is the simultaneous improvement in energy efficiency in refrigeration 
and air-conditioning equipment during the hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) 
phase-down, as recognised in the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal 
Protocol. The Kigali Amendment and related national and regional 
regulations are projected to reduce future radiative forcing from 
HFCs by about half in 2050 compared to a scenario without any HFC 
controls, and to reduce future global average warming in 2100 from 
a baseline of 0.3°C–0.5°C to less than 0.1°C, according to a recent 
scientific assessment of a  wide literature (World Meteorological 
Organization 2018). If ratified by signatories, the rapid phase-down 
of HFCs under the Kigali Amendment is possible because of extensive 
replacement of high-global warming potential (GWP) HFCs with 
commercially available low-GWP alternatives in refrigeration and 
air-conditioning equipment. Each country’s choices of alternative 
refrigerants will likely be determined by energy efficiency, costs, 
and refrigerant toxicity and flammability. National and regional 
regulations will be needed to drive technological innovation and 
development (Polonara et al. 2017).
4.2.5.7 Efficient Buildings, Cooler in Summer, Warmer 
in Winter, Towards Net Zero Energy
Most accelerated mitigation pathway scenarios include significant 
increase in building energy efficiency. Countries in cold regions, 
in particular, often focus more on building sector GHG emissions 
mitigation measures such as improving building envelopes and home 
appliances, and electrifying space heating and water heating.
For example, scenarios for Japan project continued electrification of 
residential and commercial buildings to 65% and 79% respectively 
by 2050 to reach 70–90% CO 2 reduction from 2013 levels (Kato 
and Kurosawa 2019). Similarly, a  mitigation pathway for China 
compatible with 1.5°C would require 58% to 70% electrification of 
buildings according to (Jiang et al. 2018; China National Renewable 
Energy Centre 2019E; nergy Transitions Commission and Rocky 
Mountain Institute 2019). For the EU-28 to reach net carbon 
neutrality, complete substitution of fossil fuels with electricity (up 
to 65% share), district heating, and direct use of solar and ambient 
heat are projected to be needed for buildings, along with increased 
use of solar thermal and heat pumps for heating (Duscha et al. 
2019). In the UK and Canada, improved insulation to reduce energy 
demand and efficient building appliances and heating systems are 
important building strategies needed to reduce emissions to zero 
by 2050 (Vaillancourt et al. 2017; Chilvers et al. 2017; Roberts 
et al. 2018a). In Ireland, achieving 80–95% emissions reduction 
below 1990 levels by 2050 also requires changes in building energy 
technology and efficiency, including improving building envelopes, 
fuel switching for residential buildings, and replacing service-sector 
coal use with gas and renewables according to (Chiodi et al. 2013). 
In South Africa, improving industry and building energy efficiency is 
also considered a key part of mitigation strategies (Altieri et al. 2016; 
Ouedraogo 2017).
In addition, an increasing number of countries have set up net zero 
energy building targets (Table 4.8) (Höhne et al. 2020). Twenty-seven 
countries have developed roadmap documents for NZEBs, mostly 
in developed countries in Europe, North America, and Asia-Pacific, 
focusing on energy efficiency and improved insulation and design, 
renewable and smart technologies (Mata et al. 2020). The EU, Japan 
and the USA (the latter for public buildings only) have set targets 
for shifting new buildings to 100% near-zero energy buildings by 
2030, with earlier targets for public buildings. Scotland has a similar 
target for 2050 (Höhne et al. 2020). Technologies identified as 
needed for achieving near-zero energy buildings vary by region, but 
include energy-efficient envelope components, natural ventilation, 
passive cooling and heating, high performance building systems, 
air heat recovery, smart and information and communication 
technologies, and changing future heating and cooling supply fuel 
mixes towards solar, geothermal, and biomass (Mata et al. 2020). 
Sub-national regions in Spain, USA, Germany, and Mexico have set 
local commitments to achieving net zero carbon new buildings by 
2050, with California having the most ambitious aspirational target 
of zero net energy buildings for all new buildings by 2030 (Höhne 
et al. 2020). The EU is also targeting the retrofitting of 3% of existing 
public buildings to zero-energy, with emphasis on greater thermal 
insulation of building envelopes (Höhne et al. 2020; Mata et al. 
2020). China’s roadmaps have emphasised insulation of building 
envelope, heat recovery systems in combination with renewable 
energy, including solar, shallow geothermal, and air source heat 
pumps (Mata et al. 2020).
4.2.5.8 Electrifying Transport
Electrification of transport in tandem with power sector 
decarbonisation is expected to be a  key strategy for deep CO 2 
mitigation in many countries. Passenger transport and light duty 
freight can already be electrified, but electrifying heavy-duty road 
transport and fuel switching in aviation and shipping are much more 
difficult and have not been addressed in most of the recent research.
In Germany, widespread electrification of private vehicles is expected 
by 2030 (Schmid and Knopf 2012) while for the EU-28, 50% overall transport electrification (excluding feedstock) and 75% electrification 
of road transport is needed to reach net carbon neutrality according 
to (Duscha et al. 2019). In addition, novel fuels such as hydrogen, 
synthetic hydrocarbons and sustainable biogenic fuels are needed 
to decarbonise aviation and water transport to achieve net carbon 
neutrality (Duscha et al. 2019).
In India, electrification, hydrogen, and biofuels are key to 
decarbonising the transport sector (Dhar et al. 2018; Mittal et al. 
2018; Vishwanathan et al. 2018b; Mathur and Shekhar 2020). Under 
a 1.5°C scenario, nearly half of the light-duty passenger vehicle stock 
needs to be electrified according to (Parikh et al. 2018). In China, 
a  1.5°C-compatible pathway would require electrification of two-
fifths of transport (Jiang et al. 2018; China National Renewable 
Energy Centre 2019).
Similarly, in Canada, electrification of 59% of light-duty trucks and 
23% of heavy-duty trucks are needed as part of overall strategy 
to reduce CO 2 emissions by 80% by 2050. In addition, hydrogen is 
expected to play a major role by accounting for nearly one-third of 
light-duty trucks, 68% of heavy-duty trucks, and 33% of rail by 2050 
according to Hammond et al. (2020).
4.2.5.9 Urban Form Meets Information Technology
Beyond technological measures, some densely populated countries 
including Germany, Japan, and India are exploring using information 
technology/internet of things (IOT) to support mode-shifting and 
reduce mobility demand through broader behaviour and lifestyle 
changes (Ashina et al. 2012; Canzler and Wittowsky 2016; Aggarwal 
2017; Dhar et al. 2018; Vishwanathan et al. 2018b). In Japan, 
accelerated mitigation pathways consider the use of information 
technology and internet of things (IoT) to transform human 
behaviour and transition to a sharing economy (Ashina et al. 2012; 
Oshiro et al. 2017a, 2018). In Germany, one study points to including 
electromobility information and communication technologies in 
the transport sector as key (Canzler and Wittowsky 2016) while 
another emphasise shifting from road to rail transport, and reduced 
distances travelled as other possible transport strategies (Schmid and 
Knopf 2012). India’s transport sector strategies also include use of 
information technology and the internet, a  transition to a  sharing 
economy, and increasing infrastructure investment (Dhar et al. 2018; 
Vishwanathan et al. 2018b). Behaviour and lifestyle change along 
with stakeholder integration in decision-making are considered 
key to implementing new transport policies (Aggarwal 2017; 
Dhar et al. 2018).Table 4.8 | Targets by countries, regions, cities and businesses on decarbonising the building sector.

4.2.5.10 Industrial Energy Efficiency
Industrial energy efficiency improvements are considered in nearly 
all countries but for countries where industry is expected to continue 
to be a  key sector, new and emerging technologies that require 
significant  R&D investment, such as hydrogen and CCS, make 
ambitious targets achievable.
In China, for example, non-conventional electrical and renewable 
technologies, including low-grade renewable heat, biomass use for 
high-temperature heat in steel and cement sectors, and additional 
electrification in glass, food and beverage, and paper and pulp 
industries, are part of scenarios that achieve 60% reduction in 
national CO 2 emission by 2050 (Khanna et al. 2019; Zhou et al. 
2019), in addition to increased recycled steel for electric arc furnaces 
and direct electrolysis or hydrogen-based direct reduction of iron 
and CCS utilisation in clinker and steel-making (Jiang et al. 2018; 
China National Renewable Energy Centre 2019). Similarly, in India, 
(Vishwanathan and Garg 2020) point to the need for renewable 
energy and CCS to decarbonise the industrial sector. In EU-28, net 
CO2 neutrality can only be reached with 92% reduction in industrial 
emissions relative to 1990, through electrification, efficiency 
improvement and new technologies such as hydrogen-based direct 
reduction of steel, low-carbon cement and recycling (Duscha et al. 
2019). Both China and EU see 50% of industry electrification by 2050 
as needed to meet 1.5°C and net carbon neutrality pathways (Jiang 
et al. 2018; Capros et al. 2019).
Aggressive adoption of technology solutions for power sector 
decarbonisation coupled with end-use efficiency improvements 
and low-carbon electrification of buildings, industry and transport 
provides a pathway for accelerated mitigation in many key countries, 
but will still be insufficient to meet zero emission/1.5°C goals for all 
countries. Although not included in a majority of the studies related to 
pathways and national modelling analysis, energy demand reduction 
through deeper efficiency and other measures such as lifestyle 
changes and system solutions that go beyond components, as well 
as the co-benefits of the reduction of short-lived pollutants, needs to 
be evaluated for inclusion in future zero emission/1.5°C pathways.
4.2.5.11 Lowering Demand, Downscaling Economies
Studies have identified socio-technological pathways to help achieve 
net zero CO 2 and GHG targets at national scale, that in aggregate are 
crucial to keeping global temperature below agreed limits. However, 
most of the literature focuses on supply-side options, including carbon 
dioxide removal mechanisms (BECCS, afforestation, and others) that 
are not fully commercialised (Cross-Chapter Box  8  in Chapter  12). 
Costs to research, deploy, and scale up these technologies are often 
high. Recent studies have addressed lowering demand through 
energy conversion efficiency improvements, but few studies have 
considered demand reduction through efficiency (Grubler et al. 2018) 
and the related supply implications and mitigation measures.
Five main drivers of long-term energy demand reduction that can 
meet the  1.5°C target include quality of life, urbanisation, novel 
energy services, diversification of end-user roles, and information innovation (Grubler et al. 2018). A  Low Energy Demand scenario 
requires fundamental societal and institutional transformation from 
current patterns of consumption, including: decentralised services 
and increased granularity (small-scale, low-cost technologies to 
provide decentralised services), increased use value from services 
(multi-use vs single use), sharing economies, digitalisation, and 
rapid transformation driven by end-user demand. This approach 
to transformation differs from the status quo and current climate 
change policies in emphasising energy end-use and services first, 
with downstream effects driving intermediate and upstream 
structural change.
Radical low-carbon innovation involves systemic, cultural, and policy 
changes and acceptance of uncertainty in the beginning stages. 
However, the current dominant analytical perspectives are grounded 
in neoclassical economics and social psychology, and focus primarily 
on marginal changes rather than radical transformations (Geels 
et al. 2018). Some literature is beginning to focus on mitigation 
through behaviour and lifestyle changes, but specific policy measures 
for supporting such changes and their contribution to emission 
reductions remain unclear (Section 4.4.2 and Chapter 5).
4.2.5.12 Ambitious Targets to Reduce Short-lived Climate 
Forcers, Including Methane
Recent research shows that temperature increases are likely to 
exceed 1.5°C during the 2030s and 2°C by mid-century unless both 
CO2 and short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs) are reduced (Shindell et al. 
2017; Rogelj et al. 2018a). Because of their short lifetimes (days to 
a  decade and a  half), SLCFs can provide fast mitigation, potentially 
avoiding warming of up to 0.6°C at 2050 and up to 1.2°C at 2100 
(Ramanathan and Xu 2010; Xu and Ramanathan 2017). In Asia 
especially, co-benefits of drastic CO 2 and air pollution mitigation 
measures reduce emissions of methane, black carbon, sulphur dioxide, 
nitrogen oxide, and fine particulate matter by approximately 23%, 
63%, 73%, 27%, and 65% respectively in 2050 as compared to 

adds significantly to the benefits reducing air pollutants (Hanaoka 
and Masui 2018).
To achieve net zero GHG emissions implies consideration of targets 
for non-CO 2 gases. While methane emissions have grown less rapidly 
than CO 2 and F-gases since 1990 (Chapter 2), the literature urges 
action to bring methane back to a pathway more in line with the Paris 
goals (Nisbet et al. 2020). Measures to reduce methane emissions 
from anthropogenic sources are considered intractable – where they 
sustain livelihoods  – but also becoming more feasible, as studies 
report the options for mitigation in agriculture without undermining 
food security (Wollenberg et al. 2016; Frank et al. 2017; Nisbet et al. 
2020). The choice of emission metrics has implications for SLCF (Cain 
et al. 2019) (Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 2). Ambitious reductions 
of methane are complementary to, rather than substitutes for, 
reductions in CO 2 (Nisbet et al. 2020).
Rapid SLCF reductions, specifically of methane, black carbon, and 
tropospheric ozone have immediate co-benefits including meeting 
sustainable development goals for reducing health burdens of 
household air pollution and reversing health- and crop-damaging 
tropospheric ozone (Jacobson 2002, 2010). SLCF mitigation measures 
can have regional impacts, including avoiding premature deaths in 
Asia and Africa and warming in central and northern Asia, southern 
Africa, and the Mediterranean (Shindell et al. 2012). Reducing 
outdoor air pollution could avoid 2.4 million premature deaths and 

2017). Existing research emphasises climate and agriculture benefits 
of methane mitigation measures with relatively small human health 
benefits (Shindell et al. 2012). Research also predicts that black 
carbon mitigation could substantially benefit global climate and 
human health, but there is more uncertainty about these outcomes 
than about some other predictions (Shindell et al. 2012). Other 
benefits to SLCF reduction include reducing warming in the critical 
near term, which will slow amplifying feedbacks, reduce the risk 
of non-linear changes, and reduce long-term cumulative climate 
impacts – like sea-level rise – and mitigation costs (Hu et al. 2017; 
UNEP and WMO 2011; Rogelj et al. 2018a; Xu and Ramanathan 
2017; Shindell et al. 2012).
4.2.5.13 System Analysis Solutions Are Only Beginning to 
Be Recognised in Current Literature on Accelerated 
Mitigation Pathways, and Rarely Included in Existing 
National Policies or Strategies
Most models and studies fail to address system impacts of widespread 
new technology deployment, for example: (i) material and resources 
needed for hydrogen production or additional emissions and energy 
required to transport hydrogen; or (ii) materials, resources, grid 
integration, and generation capacity expansion limits of a  largely 
decarbonised power sector and electrified transport sector. These 
impacts could limit regional and national scale-ups.
Systemic solutions are also not being sufficiently discussed, such 
as low-carbon materials; light-weighting of buildings, transport, 
and industrial equipment; promoting circular economy, recyclability 
and reusability, and addressing the food-energy-water nexus. 
These solutions reduce demand in multiple sectors, improve overall 
supply chain efficiency, and require cross-sector policies. Using 
fewer building materials could reduce the need for cement, steel, 
and other materials and thus the need for production and freight 
transport. Concrete can also be produced from low-carbon cement, 
or designed to absorb CO 2 from the atmosphere. Few regions 
have developed comprehensive policies or strategies for a  circular 
economy, with the exception of the EU and China, and policies in 
the EU have only emerged within the last decade. While China’s 
circular economy policies emphasises industrial production, water, 
pollution and scaling-up in response to rapid economic growth and 
industrialisation, EU’s strategy is focused more narrowly on waste 
and resources and overall resource efficiency to increase economic 
competitiveness (McDowall et al. 2017).
Increased bioenergy consumption is considered in many 1.5°C and 2°C 
scenarios. System thinking is needed to evaluate bioenergy’s viability 
because increased demand could affect land and water availability, 
food prices, and trade (Sharmina et al. 2016). To adequately address 
the water-energy-food nexus, policies and models must consider interconnections, synergies, and trade-offs among and within sectors, 
which is currently not the norm (Section 12.4).
A systems approach is also needed to support technological 
innovation. This includes recognising unintended consequences 
of political support mechanisms for technology adoption and 
restructuring current incentives to realise multi-sector benefits. It also 
entails assimilating knowledge from multiple sources as a basis for 
policy and decision-making (Hoolohan et al. 2019).
Current literature does not explicitly consider systematic, physical 
drivers of inertia, such as capital and infrastructure needed to support 
accelerated mitigation (Pfeiffer et al. 2018). This makes it difficult to 
understand what is needed to successfully shift from current limited 
mitigation actions to significant transformations needed to rapidly 
achieve deep mitigation.
4.2.6 Implications of Accelerated Mitigation 
for National Development Objectives
4.2.6.1 Introduction
This section examines how accelerated mitigation may impact 
the realisation of development objectives in the near- and mid-
term. It focuses on three objectives discussed in the literature, 
sustaining economic growth (Section 4.2.6.2), providing employment 
(Section  4.2.6.3), and alleviating poverty and ensuring equity 
(Section 4.2.6.4). It complements similar review performed at global 
level in Section 3.6. For a comprehensive survey of research on the 
impact of mitigation in other areas (including air quality, health, and 
biodiversity), see Karlsson et al. (2020).
4.2.6.2 Mitigation and Economic Growth  
in the Near- and Mid-term
A significant part of the literature assesses the impacts of mitigation 
on GDP , consistent with policymakers’ interest in this variable. 
It must be noted upfront that computable equilibrium models, on 
which our assessments are mostly based, capture the impact of 
mitigation on GDP and other core economic variables while typically 
overlooking other effects that may matter (like improvements in air 
quality). Second, even though GDP (or better, GDP per capita) is not 
an indicator of welfare (Fleurbaey and Blanchet 2013), changes in 
GDP per capita across countries and over time are highly correlated 
with changes in welfare indicators in the areas of poverty, health, 
and education (Gable et al. 2015). The mechanisms linking mitigation 
to GDP outlined below would remain valid even with alternative 
indicators of well-being (Section  5.2.1). Third, another stream of 
literature criticises the pursuit of economic growth as a goal, instead 
advocating a range of alternatives and suggesting modelling of post-
growth approaches to achieve rapid mitigation while improving social 
outcomes (Hickel et al. 2021). In the language of the present chapter, 
these alternatives constitute alternative development pathways.
Most country-level mitigation modelling studies in which GDP is an 
endogenous variable report negative impacts of mitigation on GDP 
in 2030 and 2050, relative to the reference (robust evidence, high 
agreement), for example (Nong et al. 2017) for Australia, (Chen et al. 
2013) for Brazil, (Dai et al. 2016; Li et al. 2017; Dong et al. 2018; Mu 
et al. 2018a; Zhao et al. 2018; Cui et al. 2019) for China, (Álvarez-
Espinosa et al. 2018) for Colombia, (Fragkos et al. 2017) for the EU, 
(Mittal et al. 2018) for India, (Fujimori et al. 2019) for Japan, (Veysey 
et al. 2014) for Mexico, (Pereira et al. 2016) for Portugal, (Alton et al. 
2014; van Heerden et al. 2016) for South Africa, (Chunark et al. 2017) 
for Thailand, (Acar and Yeldan 2016) for Turkey, (Roberts et al. 2018b) 
for the UK, (Zhang et al. 2017; Chen and Hafstead 2019) for USA, 
(Nong 2018) for Vietnam (Figure  4.4). The downward relationship 
between mitigation effort and emissions is strong in studies up to 2030, much weaker for studies looking farther ahead. In all reviewed 
studies, however, GDP continues to grow even with mitigation. It 
may be noted that none of the studies assessed above integrates the 
benefits of mitigation in terms of reduced impacts of climate change 
or lower adaptation costs. This is not surprising since these studies 
are at national or regional scale and do not extend beyond 2050, 
whereas the benefits depend on global emissions and primarily occur 
after 2050. Discussion on reduced impacts is provided in Section 3.6.2 
and Cross-Working Group Box 1 in Chapter 3.
Two major mechanisms interplay to explain the impact of 
mitigation on GDP . First, the carbon constraint imposes reduced 
Table 4.9 | Examples of country-level modelling studies finding positive short-term outcome of mitigation on GDP relative to baseline.
Reference Country/region Explanation for positive outcome of mitigation on GDP
Antimiani et al. (2016) European Union GDP increases relative to reference only in the scenario with global cooperation on mitigation.
Willenbockel et al. (2017) KenyaThe mitigation scenario introduces cheaper (geothermal) power generation units than in BAU (in which thermal increases).  
Electricity prices actually decrease.

Wei et al. (2019) ChinaAnalyse impacts of feed-in tariffs to renewables, find positive short-run impacts on GDP; public spending boost activity in the RE 
sector. New capital being built at faster rate than in reference increases activity more than activity decreases due to lower public 
spending elsewhere.

use of a production factor (fossil energy), thus reducing GDP . In the 
simulations, the mechanism at work is that firms and households 
reduce their use of GHG-intensive goods and services in response 
to higher prices due to reduced fossil energy use. Second, additional 
investment required for mitigation partially crowds out productive 
investment elsewhere (Fujimori et al. 2019), except in Keynesian 
models in which increased public investment actually boosts GDP 
(Pollitt et al. 2015; Landa Rivera et al. 2016; Bulavskaya and Reynès 
2018). Magnitude and duration of GDP loss depend on the stringency 
of the carbon constraint, the degree of substitutability with less-GHG-
intensive goods and services, assumptions about costs of low-carbon 
technologies and their evolution over time (e.g., Duan et al. 2018; van 
Meijl et al. 2018; Cui et al. 2019) and decisions by trading partners, 
which influence competitiveness impacts for firms (Alton et al. 2014; 
Fragkos et al. 2017) (high evidence, high agreement).
In the near term, presence of long-lived emissions intensive capital 
stock, and rigidities in the labour market (Devarajan et al. 2011) and 
other areas may increase impacts of mitigation on GDP . In the mid-
term, on the other hand, physical and human capital, technology, 
institutions, skills or location of households and activities are more 
flexible. The development of renewable energy may help create more 
employment and demands for new skills, particularly in the high-skill 
labour market  (Helgenberger, S. et al., 2019). In addition, cumulative 
mechanisms such as induced technical change or learning by doing 
on low-emissions technologies and process may reduce the impacts 
of mitigation on GDP .
Country-level studies find that the negative impacts of mitigation 
on GDP can be reduced if pre-existing economic or institutional 
obstacles are removed in complement to the imposition of the 
carbon constraint (robust evidence, high agreement). For example, 
if the carbon constraint takes the form of a carbon tax or of permits 
that are auctioned, the way the proceeds from the tax (or the 
revenues from the sales of permits) are used is critical for the overall 
macroeconomic impacts (Chen et al. 2013). (For a detailed discussion of different carbon pricing instruments, including the auctioning of 
permits, see Section 13.6.3).
Figure 4.5 shows that depending on the choice of how to implement 
a  carbon constraint, the same level of carbon constraint can yield 
very different outcomes for GDP . The potential for mitigating GDP 
implications of mitigation through fiscal reform is discussed in 
Section 4.4.1.8.
More generally, mitigation costs can be reduced by proper policy 
design if the economy initially is not on the efficiency frontier (Grubb 
2014), defined as the set of configurations within which the quality 
of the environment and economic activity cannot be simultaneously 
improved given current technologies – such improvements in policy 
design may include reductions in distortionary taxes. Most of the 
studies which find that GDP increases with mitigation in the near 
term precisely assume that the economy is initially not on the 
frontier. Making the economy more efficient – in other words, lifting 
the constraints that maintain the economy in an interior position – 
creates opportunities to simultaneously improve economic activity 
and reduce emissions. Table 4.9 describes the underlying assumptions 
in a selection of studies.
Finally, marginal costs of mitigation are not always reported in studies 
of national mitigation pathways. Comparing numbers across countries 
is not straightforward due to exchange rate fluctuations, differing 
assumptions by modellers in individual country studies, etc. The 
database of national mitigation pathways assembled for this Report – 
which covers only a  fraction of available national mitigation 
studies in the literature – shows that marginal costs of mitigation 
are positive, with a median value of 101 USD2010 tCO2–1 in 2030, 

46% and 76% relative to business-as-usual respectively. Marginal 
costs increase over time along accelerated mitigation pathways, as 
constraints become tighter, with a non-linearity as mitigation reaches 
80% of reference emissions or more. Dispersion across and within  –8%–6%–4%–2%0%2%4%

countries is high, even in the near term but increases notably in the 
mid-term (medium evidence, medium agreement).
4.2.6.3 Mitigation and Employment in the Short- 
and Medium-term
Numerous studies have analysed the potential impact of carbon 
pricing on labour markets. Chateau et al. (2018) and OECD (2017a) find 
that the implementation of green policies globally (defined broadly as 
policies that internalise environmental externalities through taxes and 
other tools, shifting profitability from polluting to green sectors) need 
not harm total employment, and that the broad skill composition (low, 
high- and medium-skilled jobs) of emerging and contracting sectors 
is very similar, with the largest shares of job creation and destruction 
at the lowest skill level. To smoothen the labour market transition, 
they conclude that it may be important to reduce labour taxes, to 
compensate vulnerable households, and to provide education and 
training programs, the latter making it easier for labour to move to 
new jobs. Consistent with this, other studies that simulate the impact 
of scenarios with more or less ambitious mitigation policies (including 
100% reliance on renewable energy by 2050) find relatively small 
(positive or negative) impacts on aggregate global employment that 
are more positive if labour taxes are reduced but encompass substantial 
losses for sectors and regions that today are heavily dependent on 
fossil fuels (Arndt et al. 2013; Huang et al. 2019; Vandyck et al. 2016; 
Jacobson et al. 2019). Among worker categories, low-skilled workers 
tend to suffer wage losses as they are more likely to have to reallocate, 
something that can come at a cost in the form of a wage cut (assuming 
that workers who relocate are initially less productive than those who 
already work in the sector). The results for alternative carbon revenue 
recycling schemes point to trade-offs: a reduction in labour taxes often 
leads to the most positive employment outcomes while lump-sum 
(uniform per-capita) transfers to households irrespective of income 
yield a more egalitarian outcome.
The results from country-level studies using CGE models tend be similar 
to those at global level. Aggregate employment impacts are small and 
may be positive especially if labour taxes are cut, see for example, 
Telaye et al. (2019) for Ethiopia,(Kolsuz and Yeldan (2017) for Turkey, 
Fragkos et al. (2017) for the EU, and Mu et al. (2018b) for China. On the 
other hand, sectoral reallocations away from fossil-dependent sectors 
may be substantial, see for example, Alton et al. (2014) for South Africa 
or Huang et al. (2019) for China. Targeting of investment to labour-
intensive green sectors may generate the strongest employment gains, 
see, for example, Perrier and Quirion (2018) for France, van Meijl 
et al. (2018) for the Netherlands, and Patrizio et al. 2(018) for the USA. 
Changes in skill requirements between emerging and declining sectors 
appear to be quite similar, involving smaller transitions than during the 
IT revolution (Bowen et al. 2018).
In sum, the literature suggests that the employment impact of 
mitigation policies tends to be limited on aggregate, but can 
be significant at the sectoral level (medium evidence, medium 
agreement) and that cutting labour taxes may limit adverse effects on 
employment (limited evidence, medium agreement). Labour market 
impacts, including job losses in certain sectors, can be mitigated 
by  equipping workers for job changes via education and training, and by reducing labour taxes to boost overall labour demand (Stiglitz 
et al. 2017) (Section 4.5).
Like most of the literature on climate change, the above studies 
do not address gender aspects. These may be significant 
since the employment shares for men and women vary across 
sectors and countries.
4.2.6.4  Mitigation and Equity in the Near and Mid-term
Climate mitigation may exacerbate socio-economic pressures on 
poorer households (Jakob et al. 2014). First, the price increase in 
energy-intensive goods and services – including food (Hasegawa et al. 
2018)  – associated with mitigation may affect poorer households 
disproportionally (Bento 2013), and increase the number of energy-
poor (Berry 2019). Second, the mitigation may disproportionally 
affect low-skilled workers (see previous section). Distributional 
issues have been identified not only with explicit price measures 
(carbon tax, emission permits system, subsidy removal), but also with 
subsidies for renewables (Borenstein and Davis 2016), and efficiency 
and emissions standards (Davis and Knittel 2019; Bruegge et al. 
2019; Levinson 2019; Fullerton and Muehlegger 2019).
Distributional implications, however, are context specific, depending 
on consumption patterns (initially and ease of adjusting them in 
response to price changes) and asset ownership (see for example 
analysis of energy prices in Indonesia by Renner et al. 2019). In 
an analysis of the distributional impact of carbon pricing based 
on household expenditure data for 87 low- and middle-income 
countries, Dorband et al. (2019) find that, in countries with a per-
capita income of up to USD15,000 per capita (purchasing power parity 
(PPP) adjusted), carbon pricing has a progressive impact on income 
distribution and that there may be an inversely U-shaped relationship 
between energy expenditure shares and per-capita income, rendering 
carbon pricing regressive in high-income countries, in other words, in 
countries where the capacity to pursue compensatory policies tends 
to be relatively strong.
The literature finds that the detailed design of mitigation policies 
is critical for their distributional impacts (robust evidence, high 
agreement). For example, Vogt-Schilb et al. (2019) suggest to turn 
to cash transfer programs, established as some of the most efficient 
tools for poverty reduction in developing countries. In an analysis 
of Latin America and the Caribbean, they find that allocation of 
30% of carbon revenues would suffice to compensate poor and 
vulnerable households on average, leaving the rest for other uses. 
This policy tool is not only available in countries with relatively high 
per-capita incomes: in Sub-Saharan Africa, where per-capita incomes 
are relatively low, cash transfer programs have been implemented in 
almost all countries (Beegle et al. 2018, p. 57), and are found central 
to the success of energy subsidy reforms (Rentschler and Bazilian 
2017). In the same vein, Böhringer et al. (2021) finds that recycling 
of revenues from emissions pricing in equal amounts to every 
household appeals as an attractive strategy to mitigate regressive 
effects and thereby make stringent climate policy more acceptable 
on societal fairness grounds. However, distributional gains from such 
recycling may come at the opportunity cost of not reaping efficiency 
gains from reductions in the taxes that are most distortionary 
(Goulder et al. 2019).
Distributional concerns related to climate mitigation are also prevalent 
in developed countries, as demonstrated, for instance, by France’s 
recent yellow-vest movement, which was ignited by an increase 
in carbon taxes. It exemplifies the fact that, when analysing the 
distributional effects of carbon pricing, it is not sufficient to consider 
vertical redistribution (i.e., redistribution between households at 
different incomes levels but also horizontal redistribution (i.e., 
redistribution between households at similar incomes which is due 
to differences in terms of spending shares and elasticities for fuel 
consumption). Compared to vertical redistribution, it is more difficult 
to devise policies that effectively address horizontal redistribution 
(Cronin et al. 2019; Pizer and Sexton 2019; Douenne 2020). However, 
it has been shown ex post that transfer schemes considering income 
levels and location could have protected or even improved the 
purchasing power of the bottom half of the population (Bureau et al. 
2019). Investments in public transportation may reduce  horizontal 
redistribution if it makes it easier for households to reduce fossil 
fuel consumption when prices increase (see Sections  4.4.1.5 
and 4.4.1.9). Similarly, in relation to energy use in housing, policies 
that encourage investments that raise energy efficiency for low-
income households may complement or be an alternative to taxes 
and subsidies as a means of simultaneously mitigating and reducing 
fuel poverty (Charlier et al. 2019). From a  different angle, public 
acceptance of the French increase in the carbon tax could also have 
been enhanced via a public information campaign could have raised 
public acceptance of the carbon tax increase (Douenne and Fabre 
2020). (See Section 4.4.1.8 for a discussion of this and other factors 
that influence public support for carbon taxation.)
4.2.7 Obstacles to Accelerated Mitigation and 
How Overcoming Them Amounts to Shifts 
in Development Pathways
As outlined in Sections 4.2.3, 4.2.4, 4.2.5 and 4.2.6 there is improved 
understanding since AR5 of what accelerated mitigation would 
entail in the coming decades. A  major finding is that accelerated 
mitigation pathways in the near to mid-term appear technically and 
economically feasible in most contexts. Chapter 4, however, cannot 
stop here. Section  4.2.2 has documented an important policy gap for current climate pledges, and Cross-Chapter Box 4 in this chapter 
shows an even larger ambition gap between current pledges and what 
would be needed in the near term to be on pathways consistent with 
below 2°C, let alone 1.5°C. In other words, while the implementation 
of mitigation policies to achieve updated NDC almost doubles the 
mitigation efforts, and notwithstanding the widespread availability 
of the necessary technologies, this doubling of effort merely narrows 
the gap to pathways consistent with 2°C by at most 20%.
Obstacles to the implementation of accelerated mitigation pathways 
can be grouped in four main categories (Table  4.10). The first set 
of arguments can be understood through the lens of cost-benefit 
analysis of decision-makers, as they revolve around the following 
question: Are costs too high relative to benefits? More precisely, are 
the opportunity costs – in economics terms, what is being forfeited by 
allocating scarce resources to mitigation – justified by the benefits for 
the decision-maker (whether individual, firm, or nation)? This first set 
of obstacles is particularly relevant because accelerated mitigation 
pathways imply significant effort in the short-run, while benefits in 
terms of limited warming accrue later and almost wholly to other 
actors. However, as discussed in Sections 3.6 and 4.2.6, mitigation 
costs for a  given mitigation target are not carved in stone. They 
strongly depend on numerous factors, including the way mitigation 
policies have been designed, selected, and implemented, the 
processes through which markets have been shaped by market actors 
and institutions, and nature of socially- and culturally-determined 
influences on consumer preferences. Hence, mitigation choices that 
might be expressed straightforwardly as techno-economic decisions 
are, at a deeper level, strongly conditioned by underlying structures 
of society.
A second set of likely obstacles in the short-term to accelerated 
mitigation revolves around undesirable distributional consequences, 
within and across countries. As discussed in Section  4.2.6.3, the 
distributional implications of climate policies depend strongly on their 
design, the way they are implemented, and on the context into which 
they are inserted. Distributional implications of climate policies have 
both ethics and equity dimensions, to determine what is desirable/
acceptable by a given society in a given context, notably the relative 
power of different winners and losers to have their interests taken 
into account, or not, in the relevant decision-making processes. Like 
costs, distributional implications of accelerated mitigation are rooted 
in the underlying socio-political-institutional structures of a society.

Category Main dimensionsLocation in AR6 WGIII report where 
objection is assessed and solutions 
are discussed
Costs of mitigationMarginal, sectoral or macroeconomic costs of mitigation too high; scarce resources could/
should be used for other development priorities; mitigation benefits are not worth the costs 
(or even non-existent); lack of financingSections 3.6, 4.2.6, 12.2; Chapter 15, Chapter 17
Distributional 
implicationsRisk of job losses; diminished competitiveness; inappropriate impact on poor/vulnerable people; 
negative impact on vested interestsSection 4.5; Chapter 5, Chapter 13, Chapter 14
Lack of technology Lack of suitable technologies; lack of technology transfer; unfavourable socio-political environment Section 4.2.5, Chapter 16
Unsuitable ‘structures’Inertia of installed capital stock; inertia of socio-technical systems; inertia to behaviour change; 
unsuitable institutionsSection 3.5; Chapter 5, Chapter 13
A third set of obstacles are about technology availability and 
adoption. Lack of access even to existing cost-effective mitigation 
technologies remains an important issue, particularly for many 
developing countries, and even in the short-term. Though it relates 
most directly to techno-economic costs, technology availability raises 
broader issues related to the socio-technical systems within which 
innovation and adoption are embedded, and issues of technology 
availability are inherently issues of systemic failure (Section  16.3). 
The underlying legal, economic and social structures of the economy 
are central to the different stages of socio-transition processes 
(Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 16).
The last set of obstacles revolves around the unsuitability of 
existing structures to accelerated mitigation. We include here all 
forms of established structures, material (e.g.,  physical capital) or 
not (institutions, social norms, patterns of individual behaviour), 
that are potentially long-lived and limit the implementation of 
accelerated mitigation pathways. Typically, such structures exist for 
reasons other than climate change and climate mitigation, including 
the distribution of power among various actors. Modifying them in 
the name of accelerated climate mitigation thus requires to deal with 
other non-climate issues as well. For example, resolving the landlord-
tenant dilemma, an institutional barrier to the deployment of energy efficiency in building, opens fundamental questions on private 
property in buildings.
A common thread in the discussion above is that the obstacles to 
accelerated mitigation are to a large degree rooted in the underlying 
structural features of societies. As a  result, transforming those 
underlying structures can help to remove those obstacles, and 
thus facilitate the acceleration of mitigation. This remark is all the 
more important that accelerated mitigation pathways, while very 
different across countries, all share three characteristics: speed of 
implementation, breadth of action across all sectors of the economy, 
and depth of emission reduction achieving more ambitious targets. 
Transforming those underlying structures amounts to shifting 
a  society’s development pathway (Figure  4.6). In the following 
Sections  3 and  4, we argue that it is thus necessary to recast 
accelerated mitigation in the broader context of shifting development 
pathways, and that doing so opens up additional opportunities to 
(i)  overcome the obstacles outlined above, and also (ii) combine 
climate mitigation with other development objectives.Strengthening

4.3 Shifting Development Pathways
4.3.1 Framing of Development Pathways
4.3.1.1 What are Development Pathways?
The term development pathway is defined in various ways in the 
literature, and these definitions invariably refer to the evolution 
over time of a society’s defining features. A society’s development 
pathway can be described, analysed, and explained from a variety 
of perspectives, capturing a  range of possible features, trends, 
processes, and mechanisms. It can be examined in terms of specific 
quantitative indicators, such as population, urbanisation level, 
life expectancy, literacy rate, GDP , carbon dioxide emission rate, 
average surface temperature, etc. Alternately, it can be described 
with reference to trends and shifts in broad socio-political or cultural 
features, such as democratisation, liberalisation, colonisation, 
globalisation, consumerism, etc. Or, it can be described in a way that 
highlights and details a particular domain of interest; for example, 
as an ‘economic pathway’, ‘technological pathway’, ‘demographic 
pathway’, or others. Any such focused description of a pathway is 
more limited, by definition, than the general and encompassing 
notion of a development pathway.
Development pathways represent societal evolution over time, and 
can be assessed retrospectively and interpreted in a historical light, or 
explored prospectively by anticipating and assessing alternative future 
pathways. Development pathways, and prospective development 
pathways in particular, can reflect societal objectives, as in ‘low-emission 
development pathways’, ‘climate-resilient development pathways’, 
‘sustainable development pathways’, ‘inclusive development pathway’, 
and as such can embed normative assumptions or preferences, or 
can reflect potential dystopian futures to be avoided. A  national development plan (Section  4.3.2) is a  representation of a  possible 
development pathway for a given society reflecting its objectives, as 
refracted through its development planning process.
One approach for exploring shifts in future development pathways 
is through scenarios. Some examples of scenario exercises in the 
literature are provided in Table 4.11.
Different narratives of development pathways can have distinct 
and even competing focuses such as economic growth, shifts in 
industrial structure, technological determinism, and can embody 
alternative framings of development itself (from growth to 
well-being, see Chapter  5), and of sustainable development in 
particular (Sections 1.6 and 17.1). Scenario exercises are structured 
undertakings to explore alternative future development pathways, 
often drawing on stakeholder input and accepting the deep and 
irreducible uncertainty inherent in societal development into the 
future (Schweizer and Kriegler 2012; Kahane 2012; Raskin and Swart 
2020). The results of scenario explorations, including modelling 
exercises, thus help clarify the characteristics of a particular future 
pathway, in light of a  particular set of assumptions and choice of 
indicators for assessment. Processes of developing scenarios can 
inform choices by decision makers of various kinds.
Scenarios are useful to clarify societal objectives, understand 
constraints, and explore future shifts. Scenario exercises are effective 
when they enable multi-dimensional assessment, and accommodate 
divergent normative viewpoints (Kowarsch et al. 2017). Such processes 
might take into account participants’ explicit and implicit priorities, 
values, disciplinary backgrounds, and world views. The process of 
defining and describing a society’s development pathway contributes 
to the ongoing process of understanding, explaining and defining the 
historical and contemporary meaning and significance of a society.

The imagination of facilitated stakeholder process combined with the 
rigour of modelling helps improve understanding of constraints, trade-
offs, and choices. ‘Scenario analysis offers a structured approach for 
illuminating the vast range of possibilities. A scenario is a story, told 
in words and numbers, describing the way events might unfold. If 
constructed with rigor and imagination, scenarios help us to explore 
where we might be headed, but more, offering guidance on how to 
act now to direct the flow of events toward a desirable future’  (Raskin 
et al. 2002). Scenario processes are valuable for the quantitative and 
qualitative insights they can provide, and also for the role they can 
play in providing a forum and process by which diverse institutions 
and even antagonistic stakeholders can come together, build trust, 
improve understanding, and ultimately converge in their objectives 
(Kane and Boulle 2018; Dubash 2021).
4.3.1.2 Shifting Development Pathways
Development pathways evolve as the result of the countless decisions 
and actions at all levels of societal structure, as well due to the emergent dynamics within and between institutions, cultural norms, 
socio-technological systems, and the biogeophysical environment. 
Society can choose to make decisions and take actions with the 
shared intention of influencing the future development pathway 
toward specific agreed objectives.
The SDGs provide a lens on diverse national and local development 
objectives. Humankind currently faces multiple sustainability 
challenges that together present global society with the challenge 
of assessing, deliberating, and attempting to bring about a viable, 
positive future development pathway. Ecological sustainability 
challenges include reducing GHG emissions, protecting the ozone 
layer, controlling pollutants such as aerosols and persistent organics, 
managing nitrogen and phosphorous cycles, etc. (Steffen et al. 2015), 
which are necessary to address the rising risks to biodiversity and 
ecosystem services on which humanity depends (IPBES 2019a). 
Socio-economic sustainability challenges include conflict, persistent 
poverty and deprivation, various forms of pervasive and systemic 
discrimination and deprivation, and socially corrosive inequality.

Figure 4.7 | Shifting development pathways to increased sustainability: choices by a wide range of actors at key decision points on development 
pathways can reduce barriers and provide more tools to accelerate mitigation and achieve other Sustainable Development Goals.
The global adoption of the SDGs and their underlying indicators (UN 
2017, 2018 and 2019) reflect a  negotiated prioritisation of these 
common challenges.
Figure 4.7 illustrates the process of shifting development pathways. 
The lines illustrate different possible development pathways through 
time, some of which (shown here toward the top of the figure) 
remove obstacles to the adoption and effective implementation of 
sustainable development policies, and thus give access to a  rich 
policy toolbox for accelerating mitigation and achieving SDGs. Other 
development pathways (shown here toward the bottom of the 
figure) do not overcome, or even reinforce the obstacles to adopting 
and effectively implementing sustainable development policies, 
and thus leave decision-makers with more limited policy toolbox 
(Section 4.2.7 and Figure 4.6). A richer tool box enables faster, deeper 
and broader mitigation.
The development pathways branch and branch again, signifying 
how a  diversity of decision-makers (policymakers, organisations, 
investors, voters, consumers, etc.) are continuously making choices 
that influence which of many potential development pathways 
society follows. Some of these choices fall clearly within the domain 
of mitigation policy. For example, what level carbon price, if any, 
should be imposed? Should fossil fuel subsidies be removed? Most 
decisions, of course, fall outside the direct domain of mitigation 
policy. Shifting development pathways toward sustainability involves 
this broader realm of choices beyond mitigation policy per se, and 
requires identifying those choices that are important determinants of 
the existing obstacles to accelerating mitigation and meeting other 
SDGs. Addressing these choices coherently shifts the development 
pathway away from a continuation of existing trends.
4.3.1.3 Expanding the Range of Policies and Other 
Mitigative Options
Shifting development pathways aims to influence the ultimate drivers 
of emissions (and development generally), such as the systemic and 
cultural determinants of consumption patterns, the political systems 
and power structures that govern decision-making, the institutions 
and incentives that guide and constrain socio-technical innovation, 
and the norms and information platforms that shape knowledge and 
discourse, and culture, values and needs (Raskin et al. 2002). These 
ultimate drivers determine the mitigative capacity of a society.
Decision-makers might usefully consider a broader palette of policies 
and measures as part of an overall strategy to meet climate goals and 
other sustainable development goals (Section 4.3.2 and Table 4.12). 
This is consistent with the fact that mitigation is increasingly 
understood to be inseparable from broader developmental goals, 
which can be facilitated by policy coherence and integration with 
broader objectives and policies sectorally and societally. This is 
supported by other observations that mitigation measures based 
on conventional climate policy instruments, such as emissions taxes 
or permits, price incentives such as feed-in tariffs for low-carbon 
electricity generation, and fuel economy standards, and building 
codes, which aim to influence the proximate drivers of emissions alone will not achieve the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement 
(Méjean et al. 2015; Rogelj et al. 2016; IPCC 2018a; UNEP 2018). 
An approach of shifting development pathways to increased 
sustainability (SDPS) broadens the scope for mitigation.
4.3.1.4 An Approach of SDPS Helps Manage Trade-offs 
Between Mitigation and Other SDGs
Beyond removing structural obstacles to accelerated mitigation, 
broadening the approach to policies that facilitate shifts in 
development pathways also helps manage the potential trade-offs 
between mitigation and other development objectives discussed 
in Section 4.2.7.
Systematic studies of the 17 SDGs have found the interactions 
among them to be manifold and complex (Nilsson et al. 2016; 
Pradhan et al. 2017; Weitz et al. 2018; Fuso Nerini et al. 2019). 
Addressing them calls for interventions affecting fundamental, 
interconnected, structural features of global society (International 
Panel on Social Progress 2018; TWI2050 – The World in 2050 2018), 
such as to our physical infrastructure (e.g., energy, water, industrial, 
urban infrastructure) (Waage et al. 2015; Adshead et al. 2019; 
Chester 2019; Mansell et al. 2019; Thacker et al. 2019; ), our societal 
institutions (e.g.,  educational, public health, economic, innovation, 
and political institutions) (Ostrom 2010; Kläy et al. 2015; Messner 
2015; Sachs et al. 2019), and behavioural and cultural tendencies 
(e.g.,  consumption patterns, conventional biases, discriminatory 
interpersonal and intergroup dynamics, and inequitable power 
structures) (Esquivel 2016; Sachs et al. 2019). These observations 
imply that attempt to address each SDG in isolation, or as 
independent technical challenges, would be insufficient, as would 
incremental, marginal changes. In contrast, effectively addressing 
the SDGs is likely to mean significant disruption of long-standing 
trends and transformative progress to shift development pathways 
to meet al. the SDGs, including climate action, beyond incremental 
changes targeted at addressing mitigation objectives in isolation. 
In other words, mitigation conceived as incremental change is not 
enough. Transformational change has implications for equity in its 
multiple dimensions ( Steffen and Stafford Smith 2013; Klinsky et al. 
2017a; Leach et al. 2018) including just transitions (Section 4.5).
Working Group II examines climate resilient development pathways 
(CRDP)  – continuous processes that imply deep societal changes 
and/or transformation, so as to strengthen sustainable development, 
efforts to eradicate poverty and reduce inequalities while promoting 
fair and cross-scalar capacities for adaptation to global warming and 
reduction of GHG emissions in the atmosphere. Transformative action 
in the context of CRDP specifically concerns leveraging change in 
the five dimensions of development (people, prosperity, partnership, 
peace, planet) (AR6 WGII, Chapter 18).
Section  4.3.2 provides more details on the way development 
pathways influence emissions and mitigative capacity. Section 4.3.3 
provides examples of shifts in development pathways, as well as 
of policies that might facilitate those. Cross-Chapter Box  5  in this 
chapter details the links between SDPS and sustainability.
4.3.2 Implications of Development Pathways 
for Mitigation and Mitigative Capacity
4.3.2.1 Countries Have Different Development Priorities
At the global level, the SDGs adopted by all the United Nations Member 
States in 2015 are delineated with a view to end poverty, protect the 
planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030. 
The 17 SDGs are integrated and imply that development must balance 
social, economic and environmental sustainability.
While all countries share the totality of the SDGs, development 
priorities differ across countries and over time. These priorities are 
strongly linked to local contexts, and depend on which dimensions 
of improvements in the well-being of people are considered 
the most urgent.
Development priorities are reflected in the decisions that actors 
within societies make, such as policy choices by governments and 
parliaments at all levels, votes over competing policy platforms by 
citizens, or selection of issues that non-state actors push for. Multiple 
objectives range from poverty eradication to providing energy access, 
addressing concerns of inequality, providing education, improving 
health, cleaning air and water, improving connectivity, sustaining 
growth and providing jobs, among others. For example, eradicating 
poverty and reducing inequality is a key development priority across 
many countries, such as Brazil (Grottera et al. 2017), Indonesia 
(Irfany and Klasen 2017), India (GoI 2015), South Africa (Winkler 
2018) and other low- and middle-income countries (Dorband et al. 
2019). Reducing inequality relates not only to income, but also to 
other dimensions such as in access to energy services (Tait 2017), 
gender, education, racial and ethnic profiles (Andrijevic et al. 2020), 
and thereby assumes relevance in both developing and developed 
countries. The development priorities of many poor countries and 
communities with low capacities to adapt, has been focused more 
on reducing poverty, providing basic infrastructure, education and 
improving health, rather than on mitigation (Chimhowu et al. 2019).
4.3.2.2 The Nature of National Development 
Plans Is Changing
Governments are increasingly resorting to the development of 
national plans to build institutions, resources, and risk/shock 
management capabilities to guide national development. The 
number of countries with a  national development plan has more 
than doubled, from about 62 in 2006 (World Bank 2007) to 134 
plans published between 2012 and 2018 (Chimhowu et al. 2019). 
The comeback of planning may be linked to increased consideration 
given to sustainability, which is by construction forward-looking and 
far ranging, and therefore requires state and civil society to prepare 
and implement plans at all levels of governance. Governments 
are increasingly engaging in the development and formulation of 
national plans in an organised, conscious and continual attempt to 
select the best available alternatives to achieve specific goals.
A systematic assessment of 107 national development plans and 

are increasingly focusing on mobilising action across multiple actors 
and multiple dimensions to enhance resilience and improve the 
ability to undertake stronger mitigation actions. Various initiatives 
such as the World Summit for Children in 1990; the Heavily Indebted 
Poor Country initiative that started offering debt relief in exchange 
for commitments by beneficiary states to invest in health, education, 
nutrition and poverty reduction in 1996; and push towards 
Comprehensive Development Frameworks seem to have catalysed 
the development of national actions plans across countries to 
estimate, measure and track investments and progress towards SDGs.
The most recent development plans also tend to differ from the 
earlier ones in terms of their approach. Complexity science has over 
the years argued for new forms of planning based on contingency, 
behaviour change, adaptation and constant learning (Colander and 
Kupers 2016; Ramalingam, 2013), and new plans have increasingly 
focused on increasing resilience of individuals, organisations and 
systems (Hummelbrunner and Jones, 2013). Finally, alongside short-
term (typically five year) plans with operational purpose, countries 
have also expressed visions of their development pathways over 
longer time horizons, via, for example, Voluntary National Reviews 
submitted in the context of the UN High Level Political Forum on 
Sustainable Development.
National development plans are also increasingly more holistic 
in their approach, linking closely with SDGs and incorporating 
climate action in their agendas. For instance, the Low Carbon 
Development Initiative (LCDI), launched in 2017 by the Government 
of Indonesia, seeks to identify the development policies that can help 
Indonesia achieve multiple (social, economic, and environmental) 
goals simultaneously along with preserving and improving the 
country’s  natural resources (Bappenas 2019). Likewise, Nepal’s 
Fifteenth Plan (five-year) recognises the need for climate mitigation 
and adaptation and corresponding access to international finance 
and technologies. The plan suggests mobilisation of foreign aid in the 
climate change domain in line with Nepal’s priorities and its inclusion 
in the country’s climate-friendly development programs as the key 
opportunities in this regard (Nepal 2020).
China’s development plans have evolved over time from being 
largely growth oriented, and geared largely towards the objectives 
of addressing poverty, improving health, education and public 
well-being to also including modernisation of agriculture, industry 
and infrastructure, new forms of urbanisation and a clear intent of 
focusing on innovation and new drivers of development (Central 
Compilation & Translation Press 2016). China’s 14th Five Year Plan 
not only seeks to promote high quality development in all aspects 
and focus on strengthening the economy in the global industrial 
chain, but also includes a vision of an ‘ecological civilisation’, which 
had been developed (CPC-CC 2015) and analysed earlier (He 2016; 
Xiao and Zhao 2017). It seeks to enhance China’s climate pledge to 
peak CO2 emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 
through more vigorous policies and measures. Development plans 
tie in multiple development priorities that evolve and broaden over 
time as societies develop, as exemplified inter alia by the history of 
development plans in India (Box 4.4).
4.3.2.3 Development Pathways Shape Emissions 
and Capacities to Mitigate
Analysis in the mitigation literature often frames mitigation policy 
as having development co-benefits, the main objective being climate 
stabilisation. This misses the point that development drives emissions, 
and not vice versa, and it is the overall development approach and 
policies that determine mitigation pathways (Munasinghe 2007). 
A large body of literature supports the fact that development pathways 
have direct and, just as importantly, indirect implications for GHG 
emissions (Nakicenovic et al. 2000; Winkler 2017b), through multiple 
channels, such as the nature of economic activity, spatial patterns of 
development, degree of inequality, and population growth.
Economic structure: Chapter  2  notes that overall, affluence 
(GDP per capita), economic growth and population growth have 
remained the main upward drivers of CO 2 emissions from fossil-
fuel combustion in the past decade, with energy efficiency the 
main countervailing force (Lin and Liu 2015; Wang and Feng 2017) 
(Section  2.4). A  major component of the development pathway of 
a country is precisely the nature of the economic activities on which 
the country relies (e.g.,  agriculture and mining, heavy industry, 
services, high-tech products, etc.) as well as the way it articulates its 
economy with the rest of the World (e.g., export-led growth vs import 
substitution strategies). Hence, the development pathway ultimately 
drives the underlying structure of the economy, and to a large degree 
the relationship between activity and GHG emissions.
At country level, however, the picture is more nuanced. Both India 
and China show signs of relative decoupling between GDP and 
emissions because of structural change (Chen et al. 2018a). Sumabat 
et al. (2016) indicate that economic growth had a negative impact on 
CO2 emissions in Philippines. Baek and Gweisah (2013) find that CO 2 emissions tend to drop monotonously as incomes increased. Lantz 
and Feng (2006) also indicate that per capita GDP is not related 
to CO 2 emissions in Canada. Other studies point to an emerging 
consensus that the relationship between CO 2 emissions and economic 
indicators depends on the level of development of countries (Nguyen 
and Kakinaka 2019; Sharma 2011). While some literature indicates 
that absolute decoupling of economic growth and GHG emissions 
has occurred in some countries (Le Quéré et al. 2019), a  larger 
systematic review found limited evidence of this (Haberl et al. 2020).
Looking ahead, choices about the nature of economic activities are 
expected to have significant implications for emissions. For example, 
a development pathway that focuses on enhancing economic growth 
based on manufacturing is likely to lead to very different challenges 
for mitigation compared to one that focuses on services-led growth. 
(Quéré et al. 2018) find that choices about whether or not to export 
offshore oil in Brazil will have significant implications for the country’s 
GHG emissions. Similarly, in China, transforming industrial structure 
towards tertiary sectors (Kwok et al. 2018) and restructuring exports 
towards higher value-added products (Wu et al. 2019) are expected 
to have significant implications for GHG emissions.
Spatial patterns of development: Chapter  2  notes that rapid 
urbanisation in developing and transition countries leads to increased 
CO2 emissions, the substantial migration of rural populations to urban 
areas in these countries being the main factor leading to increased 
levels of income and expenditure of new urban dwellers which in turn 
leads to increased personal carbon footprints and overall emissions 
(Section  2.4). Urbanisation, and more broadly spatial patterns of 
development, are in turned driven to a large part by development 
choices, such as, inter alia, spatial provision of infrastructure and 
services, choices regarding the agriculture and forestry sector, 
land-use policies, support to regional/local development, among Box 4.4 | India’s National Development Plan
India’s initial national development plans focused on improving the living standards of its people, increasing national income and 
food self-sufficiency. Accordingly, there was a thrust towards enhancing productivity of the agricultural and industrial sectors. While 
the main focus was on maintaining high economic growth and industrial productivity, poverty eradication, employment and inclusive 
growth remained important priorities. The National Action Plan on Climate Change with eight National Missions focusing on mitigation 
as well as adaptation was launched in 2008 integrating climate change considerations in planning and decision-making (MoEF 2008). 
The 12th Five-Year Plan (2012–2017) also brought in a focus on sustainability and mentioned the need for faster, sustainable and 
inclusive growth. The National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog) was set up in 2017 replacing the erstwhile Planning 
Commission, with a renewed focus towards bringing innovation, technology, enterprise and efficient management together at the 
core of policy formulation and implementation. However, while India has moved away from its Five-Year Plans, decision-making is 
more dynamic, with a  number of sector-specific initiatives and targets focused on integrating sustainability dimensions through 
a series of policies and measures supporting resource efficiency, improved energy access, infrastructure development, low-carbon 
options and building resilient communities, among other objectives (MoEFCC 2018, 2021). India’s overall development pathway 
currently has a strong focus on achieving robust and inclusive growth to ensure balanced development across all regions and states 
and across sectors. There is a thrust on embracing new technologies while fostering innovation and upskilling, modernisation of 
agriculture, improving regional and interpersonal equity, bridging the gap between public and private sector performance, by focusing 
on efficient delivery of public services, rooting out corruption and black economy, formalising the economy and expanding the tax 
base, improving the ease of doing business, nursing the stressed commercial banking sector back to a healthy state, and stopping 
leakages through direct benefit transfers, among other measures (GoI 2015, 2018; MoEFCC 2021).
others (World Bank 2009). For example, Dorin (2017) points out 
that if agriculture sectors in Africa and India follow the same 
development path that developed countries have followed in the 
past, namely increased labour productivity through enlargement 
and robotisation of farms, then unprecedented emigrations of rural 
workers towards cities or foreign countries will ensue, with large-
scale social, economic and environmental consequences. Looking 
ahead, a development pathway that encourages concentrated influx 
of people to large urban centres will lead to very different energy and 
infrastructure consumption patterns than a pathway that prioritises 
the development of smaller, self-contained towns and cities.
Degree of inequality: Chapter  2  notes that while eradicating 
extreme poverty and providing universal access to modern energy 
services to poor populations across the globe has negligible 
implications for emissions growth, existing studies on the role of 
poverty and inequality as drivers of GHG emissions provide limited 
evidence that under certain contexts greater inequality can lead 
to a deterioration in environmental quality and may be associated 
with higher GHG emissions (Section 2.4). In fact, factors affecting 
household consumption-based emissions include household size, 
age, education attainment, employment status, urban vs rural 
location and housing stock (Druckman and Jackson 2015). There 
is evidence to indicate that at the household level, the increase 
in emissions from additional consumption of the lower income 
households could be larger than the reduction in emissions from 
the drop in consumption from the high income households (Sager 
2019). Accordingly, as countries seek to fulfil the objective of 
reducing inequality, there are possibilities of higher increase in 
emissions (Sager 2019).
Since reducing inequality, as noted above, is globally one of the 
main development priorities, a  large body of literature focuses on 
the compatibility of climate change mitigation and reduction in 
economic inequality (Baek and Gweisah 2013; Auffhammer and 
Wolfram 2014; Berthe and Elie 2015; Hao et al. 2016; Grunewald 
et al. 2017; Wiedenhofer et al. 2017). However, the use of narrow 
approaches or simple methods of studying the relationships of 
income inequality and emissions by looking at correlations, may miss 
important linkages. For example, the influence of inequality on social 
values such as status and civic mindedness and non-political interests 
that shape environmental policy can influence overall consumption 
and its environmental impacts (Berthe and Elie 2015). Moreover, 
inequalities may also be reflected in gender, education, racial and ethnic profiles and could accordingly be associated with the level of 
emissions and mitigation prospects (Andrijevic et al. 2020).
The Illustrative Mitigation Pathways (IMP) developed for this 
Report (Box 3.1 and Section 3.2.5) provide another example of how 
development pathways influence mitigative capacity. Precisely, 
IMP1.5-SP (Shifting Pathways) and 1.5-Ren (Renewables) lead to the 
same long-term temperature, but differ in underlying socio-economic 
conditions. The former is based on Shared Socio-economic Pathway 
(SSP) 1  (sustainable development), whereas the latter is based on 
SSP2 (middle of the road). Comparing 1.5-Ren to 1.5-SP can thus be 
interpreted as a numerical translation of trying the reach the same 
long-term temperature goal without and with shifting development 
pathways towards sustainability. Data shows that the global price of 
carbon necessary to remain on target is 40–50% lower in the latter 
relative to the former, thus indicating that mitigation is cheaper with 
a  shift in development pathway towards sustainability. Other cost 
indicators (e.g. consumption loss or GDP loss) tell the same story. 
Since both IMPs were computed using the same underlying model, 
the comparison is even more robust.
In sum, development pathways can lead to different emission levels 
and different capacities and opportunities to mitigate (medium 
evidence, high agreement). Thus, focusing on shifting development 
pathways can lead to larger systemic sustainability benefits.
4.3.2.4 Integrating Mitigation Considerations Requires  
Non-marginal Shifts in Development Pathways
Concerns about mitigation are already being introduced in national 
development plans, as there is evidence that development strategies 
and pathways can be carefully designed so as to align towards multiple 
priorities and achieve greater synergistic benefits. For example, India’s 
solar programme is a key element in its NDC that can in the long run, 
not only provide energy security and contribute to mitigation, but 
can simultaneously contribute to economic growth, improved energy 
access and additional employment opportunities, if appropriate 
policies and measures are carefully planned and implemented. 
However, the environmental implications of the transition need to be 
carefully examined with regard to the socio-economic implications 
in light of the potential of other alternatives like green hydrogen, 
nuclear or carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS). Similarly, South 
Africa National Development Plan (2011) also integrates transition to 
low-carbon as part of the country development objectives (Box 4.5).
Box 4.5 | South Africa’s National Development Plan
South Africa adopted its first National Development Plan (NDP) in 2011 (NPC 2011), the same year in which the country adopted 
climate policy (RSA 2011) and hosted COP17 in Durban. Chapter 5 of the NDP addresses environmental sustainability in the context 
of development planning, and specifically ‘an equitable transition to a low-carbon economy’ (NPC 2011). The chapter refers explicitly 
to the need for a just transition, protecting the poor from impacts and any transitional costs from emissions-intensive to low-carbon. 
The plan proposes several mitigation measures, including a carbon budgeting approach, reference to Treasury’s carbon tax, use of 
various low-carbon options while maintaining energy security, and the integrated resource plan for electricity. The NDP refers to coal 
in several chapters, in some places suggesting additional investment (including new rail lines to transport coal and coal to liquids),
Looking ahead, given that different development pathways can lead 
to different levels of GHG emissions and to different capacities and 
opportunities to mitigate, there is increasing research on how to make 
development pathways more sustainable. Literature is also focusing 
on the need for a ‘new normal’ as a  system capable of achieving 
higher quality growth while addressing multiple development 
objectives by focusing on ‘innovative development pathways’.
Literature suggests that if development pathways are to be changed 
to address the climate change problem, choices that would need to 
be made about development pathways would not be marginal (Stern 
2009), and would require a new social contract to address a complex 
set of inter-linkages across sectors, classes and the whole economy 
(Winkler 2017b). Shifting development pathways necessitates 
planning in a  holistic manner, rather than thinking about discrete 
and isolated activities and actions to undertake mitigation. Further, 
the necessary transformational changes can be positive if they are 
rooted in the development aspirations of the economy and society in 
which they take place (Dubash 2012; Jones et al. 2013), but they can 
also lead to carbon colonialism if the transformations are imposed by 
Northern donors or perceived as such.
Accordingly, influencing a  societies’ development pathways draws 
upon a  broader range of policies and other efforts than narrowly 
influencing mitigation pathways, to be able to achieve the multiple 
objectives of reducing poverty, inequality and GHG emissions. The 
implications for employment, education, mobility, housing and many 
other development aspects must be integrated and new ways of 
looking at development pathways which are low carbon must be 
considered (Bataille et al. 2016b; Waisman et al. 2019). For instance, 
job creation and education are important elements that could play 
a key role in reducing inequality and poverty in countries like South 
Africa and India (Winkler et al. 2015; Rao and Min 2018) while these 
also open up broader opportunities for mitigation.
4.3.2.5 New Tools Are Needed to Pave and Assess 
Development Pathways
Relative to the literature on mitigation pathways described in 4.2.5 
and in  4.3.3, the literature on development pathways is limited. 
The climate research community has developed the Shared Socio-
economic Pathways (SSPs) that link several socio-economic drivers 
including equity in relation to welfare, resources, institutions, 
governance and climate mitigation policies in order to reflect 
many of the key development directions (O’Neill et al. 2014). In most modelling exercises however, development remains treated 
as an exogenous input. In addition, models may capture only 
some dimensions of development that are relevant for mitigation 
options, thereby not capturing distributional aspects and not 
allowing consistency checks with broader developmental goals 
(Valadkhani et al. 2016). Quantitative tools for assessing mitigation 
pathways could be more helpful if they could provide information 
on a  broader range of development indicators, and could model 
substantively different alternative development paths, thereby 
providing information on which levers might shift development in 
a more sustainable direction.
Doing so requires new ways of thinking with interdisciplinary 
research and use of alternative frameworks and methods suited to 
deeper understanding of change agents, determinants of change 
and adaptive management among other issues (Winkler 2018). 
This includes, inter alia, being able to examine enabling conditions 
for shifting development pathways (Section  4.4.1); re-evaluating 
the neo-classical assumptions within most models, both on the 
functioning of markets and on the behaviour of agents, to better 
address obstacles on the demand side, obstacles on the supply 
side and market distortions (Ekholm et al. 2013; Staub-Kaminski 
et al. 2014; Grubb et al. 2015) improving representation of issues 
related with uncertainty, innovation, inertia and irreversibility 
within the larger development contexts, including energy access 
and security; improving the representation of social and human 
capital, and of social, technological and governance innovations 
(Pedde et al. 2019).
Tools have been developed in that direction, for example in the 
Mitigation Action Plans and Scenarios (MAPS) community (La 
Rovere et al. 2014b), but need to be further mainstreamed in the 
analysis. Back-casting is often a  preferred modelling approach for 
assessment aiming to align national development goals with global 
climate goals like CO 2 stabilisation. Back-casting is a  normative 
approach where modellers construct desirable futures and specify 
upfront targets and then find out possible pathways to attain these 
targets (IPCC et al. 2001). Use of approaches like back-casting are 
useful not only in incorporating the long term national development 
objectives in the models, but also evaluating conflicts and synergies 
more effectively (van der Voorn et al. 2020). In back casting, the long-
term national development objectives remain the key benchmarks 
guiding the model dynamics and the global climate goal is interfaced 
to realise the co-benefits. The models then delineate the roadmap 
of national actions such that the national goals are achieved with Box 4.5 (continued)
in others decommissioning coal-fired power ‘procuring at least 20,000 MW of renewable electricity by 2030, importing electricity 
from the region, decommissioning 11,000 MW of ageing coal-fired power stations and stepping up investments in energy-efficiency’ 
(NPC 2011: p. 46). Reference to environmental sustainability is not limited to Chapter 5 – the introductory vision statement includes 
acknowledgement ‘that each and every one of us is intimately and inextricably of this earth with its beauty and life-giving sources; 
that our lives on earth are both enriched and complicated by what we have contributed to its condition’ (NPC 2011: p. 21); and the 
overview of the plan includes a section on climate change, addressing both mitigation and adaptation.
a  comprehensive understanding of the full costs and benefits of 
low-carbon development (often including the costs of adaptation 
and impacts from residual climate change). Back-casting modelling 
exercises show that aligning development and climate actions could 
result in much lower ‘social cost of carbon’ (Shukla et al. 2008). 
Back-casting does not aim to produce blueprints. Rather, it indicates 
the relative feasibility and the social, environmental, and political 
implications of different development and climate futures on the 
assumption of a clear relationship between goal setting and policy 
planning (Dreborg 1996). Accordingly, back-casting exercises are 
well suited for preparing local specific roadmaps like for cities (Gomi 
et al. 2010, 2011).
4.3.3 Examples of Shifts in Development Pathways and 
of Supporting Policies
As noted in Section  4.3.1, policy approaches that include 
a broader range of instruments and initiatives would impact more 
fundamentally on the actors, institutions and structures of societies 
and the dynamics among them, aiming to alter the underlying drivers 
of emissions, opening up a wider range of mitigation opportunities 
and potential in the process of achieving societal development goals. 
While the evolution of these drivers is subject to varied influences 
and complex interactions, there are policy measures by which 
decision-makers might influence them. Table  4.12 provides some 
examples of policy measures that can affect key drivers (shown in 
the row headings).
Table 4.12 | Examples of policies that can help shift development pathways.

 –Ecological tax reform

and institutions –Campaign finance laws
 –Regulatory transparency
 –Commitment to multilateral environmental governance
 –Public investment in education and R&D

 –Litigation and liability regulations
 –Reform of subsidies and other incentives not aligned with
 –Insurance sector and pension regulation
 –Green quantitative easing
 –Risk disclosurePolicies such as those listed in Table 4.12 are typically associated with 
broader objectives than GHG mitigation. They are generally conceived 
and implemented in the pursuit of overall societal development 
objectives, such as job creation, macroeconomic stability, economic 
growth, and public health and welfare. However, they can have major 
influence on mitigative capacity, and hence can be seen as necessary 
tools if mitigation options are to be significantly broadened and 
accelerated (medium evidence, medium agreement). The example of 
the UK shows how accelerated mitigation through dietary changes 
require a wide set of efforts to shift underlying drivers of behaviour. 
In this case, multiple forces have interacted to lead to reduced meat 
consumption, including health attitudes, animal welfare concerns, 
and an increasing focus on climate and other environmental 
impacts of livestock production, along with corporate investment 
in market opportunities, and technological developments in meat 
alternatives (Box 5.5).
Other historic cases that are unrelated to recent mitigation efforts 
might be more appropriate examples of major socio-technical shifts 
that were largely driven by intentional, coherent intentional policy 
initiatives across numerous domains to meet multiple objectives. The 
modernisation of agriculture in various national contexts fits such 
a  mold. In the USA, for example, major government investments 
in agricultural innovation through the creation of agricultural 
universities and support for research provided advances in the 
technological basis for modernisation. A  network of agricultural 
extension services accelerated the popularization and uptake of 
modern methods. Infrastructure investments in irrigation and drainage 
made production more viable, and investment in roadways and rail 
for transport supported market formation. Agricultural development 
banks made credit available, and government subsidies improved 
the profitability for farmers and agricultural corporations. Public 
campaigns were launched to modify food habits (Ferleger 2000).
Further examples of SDPS across many different systems and sectors 
are elaborated across this report. Concrete examples assessed in 
this chapter include high employment and low emissions structural 
change, fiscal reforms for mitigation and social contract, combining 
housing policies to deliver both housing and transport mitigation, 
and change economic, social and spatial patterns of development 
of the agriculture sector provide the basis for sustained reductions 
in emissions from deforestation (Sections  4.4.1.7–4.4.1.10). These 
examples differ by context. Examples in other chapters include 
transformations in energy, urban, building, industrial, transport, 
and land-based systems, changes in behaviour and social practices, 
as well as transformational changes across whole economies and 
societies (Cross-Chapter Box 5 in this chapter, Section 5.8, Box 6.2, 
Sections 8.2, 8.3.1, 8.4, 9.8.1, 9.8.2 and 10.4.1, and Cross-Chapter 
Box 12 in Chapter 16). These examples and others can be understood 
in the context of an explanation of the concept of SDPS, and how to 
shifting development pathways (Cross-Chapter Box 5 in this chapter).

1. What do we mean by development pathways?
In the present report, development pathways refer to patterns of development resulting from multiple decisions and choices made 
by many actors in the national and global contexts. Each society whether in the Global North or the Global South follows its own 
pattern of development (Figure 1.6). Development pathways can also be described at smaller scales (e.g., for regions or cities). By 
extension, the concept can also be applied to sectors and systems (e.g., the development pathway of the agricultural sector or of 
industrial systems).
2. Why do development pathways matter in a report about mitigation?
2a. Past development pathways determine both today’s GHG emissions and the set of opportunities to reduce emissions
Development pathways drive GHG emissions for a large part (Sections 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6). For example, different social choices and 
policy packages with regard to land use and associated rents will result in human settlements with different spatial patterns, different 
types of housing markets and cultures, and different degrees of inclusiveness, and thus different demand for transport services and 
associated GHG emissions (Sections 8.3.1 and 10.2.1).
There is compelling evidence to show that continuing along existing development pathways is unlikely to achieve rapid and deep 
emission reductions (robust evidence, medium agreement). For example, investments in long-lived infrastructure, including energy 
supply systems, could lock-in high emissions pathways and risk making deep decarbonisation and sustainable policies more 
difficult and expensive.
Development pathways also determine the set of tools available to mitigate climate change (Figure 4.7). For example, the capacity 
of households to move closer to their workplace, in response to, for example, a price signal on carbon and thus on gasoline, depends 
on rents, which themselves depend on the spatial patterns of development of human settlements (Section 8.3.1). Said differently, 
mitigation costs depend on past development choices. Similarly, development pathways determine the enablers and levers available 
for adaptation (AR6 WGII, Chapter 18) and for achieving other SDGs.
In the absence of shifts in development pathways, conventional mitigation policy instruments (e.g., carbon tax, emission quotas, 
technological norms, etc.) may not be able to limit emissions to a degree sufficient for deep decarbonisation or only at very high 
economic and social costs.
Policies to shift development pathways, on the contrary, make mitigation policies more effective. For example, policies that prioritise 
non-car transit, or limit rents close to work places would make it easier for households to relocate in response to a price signal on 
transport, and thus makes the same degree of mitigation achievable at lower economic and social cost.
2b. Shifting development pathways broadens the scope for synergies between development objectives and mitigation
Second, societies pursue a variety of development objectives, of which protecting the Earth’s climate is part. The SDGs provide a global 
mapping of these goals. Absent climate mitigation, our collective ability to achieve the SDGs in 2030 and to sustain them beyond 2030 
is likely to be compromised, even if adaptation measures are put in place (AR6 WGII).
There are many instances in which reducing GHG emissions and moving towards the achievement of other development objectives 
can go hand in hand, in the near-, mid- and long-term (Sections 3.7, 6.7.7, 7.6.5, 8.2, 9.8, 10.1.1, 11.5.3 and 17.3, and Figures 3.40 
and 12.1). For example, transitions from coal-based power to lower-emissions electricity generation technologies and from internal 
combustion engine to lower-carbon transport has large mitigation potential and direct benefits for health through reduction in local 
air pollution (Box 6.2 and Section 10.4.1). Energy efficiency in buildings and energy poverty alleviation through improved access to 
clean fuels also delivers significant health benefits (Sections 9.8.1 and 9.8.2).
Cross-Chapter Box 5 (continued)
Careful design of mitigation policies is critical to achieving these synergies (Section 13.8). Integrated policies can support the creation 
of synergies between climate change goals and other SDGs. For example, when measures promoting walkable urban areas are 
combined with electrification and clean renewable energy, there are several co-benefits to be attained (Figure SPM.8 and Section 5.2). 
These include reduced pressures on agricultural land from reduced urban growth, health co-benefits from cleaner air and benefits from 
enhanced mobility (Sections 8.2, 8.4 and 4.4.1.9).
Policy design can also manage trade-offs, for example through policy measures as part of just transitions (Section 17.4). However, 
even with good policy design, decisions about mitigation actions, and the timing and scale thereof, may entail trade-offs with the 
achievement of other national development objectives in the near-, mid- and long term. In the near term, for example, regulations may 
ban vehicles from city centres to reduce congestion and local air pollution, but reduce mobility and choice. Increasing green spaces 
within cities without caps on housing prices may involve trade-offs with affordable housing and push low income residents outside 
the city (Section 8.2.2). In the mid- and long-term, large-scale deployment of biomass energy raises concerns about food security and 
biodiversity conservation (Sections 3.7.1, 3.7.5, 7.4.4, 9.8.1, 12.5.2 and 12.5.3). Conflicts between mitigation and other development 
objectives can act as an impediment to climate action (Section 13.8). Climate change is the result of decades of unsustainable energy 
production, land-use, production and consumption patterns, as well as governance arrangements and political economic institutions 
that lock in resource-intensive development patterns (robust evidence, high agreement). Reframing development objectives and 
shifting development pathways towards sustainability can help transform these patterns and practices, allowing space for transitions 
transforming unsustainable systems (medium evidence, high agreement) (Chapter 17, Executive Summary).
Prioritising is one way to manage trade-offs, addressing some national development objectives earlier than others. Another way 
is to adopt policy packages aimed at shifting development pathways towards sustainability as they expand the range of tools available 
to simultaneously achieve multiple development objectives, including mitigation. In the city example of Section 2a, a carbon tax alone 
would run counter to other development objectives if it made suburban households locked into high emissions transport modes poorer 
or if it restricted mobility choices, in particular for low- and middle-income households. Policy packages combining affordable housing 
and provision of safe low-carbon mobility could both facilitate equitable access to housing (a major development objective in many 
countries) and make it easier to mitigate by shifting the urban development pathway.
Similarly, a fundamental shift in the service provision that helps reduce energy demand (Chapter 5), driven by targeted policies, 
investment and enabling socio-cultural and behavioural change, would reduce pressure on supply side mitigation need, hence limiting 
pressure on water and food and the achievement of associated SDGs. Some studies assume Western European lifestyle as a reference 
for the Global North and an improvement in the living standard for the Global South to reduce energy demand and emissions (Grubler 
et al. 2018), while others explore a transformative change in the Global North to achieve a decent living standard for all (Bertram et al. 
2018; Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020) (Section 3.7.8). For example, in the UK, interaction between multiple behavioural, socio-cultural, 
and corporate drivers including NGO campaigns, social movements and product innovations resulted in an observed decline in meat 
consumption (Sections 5.4 and 5.6.4).
3. What does shifting development pathways towards sustainability entail?
Shifting development pathways towards sustainability implies making transformative changes that disrupt existing developmental 
trends. Such choices would not be marginal (Stern 2009), but include technology adoption, infrastructure availability and use, and 
socio-behavioural factors (Chapter 5).
These include creating new infrastructure, sustainable supply chains, institutional capacities for evidence-based and integrated 
decision-making, financial alignment towards low-carbon socially responsible investments, just transitions and shifts in behaviour 
and norms to support shifts away from fossil-fuel consumption (Green and Denniss 2018). Adopting multi-level governance modes, 
tackling corruption where it inhibits shifts to sustainability, and improving social and political trust are also key for aligning and 
supporting long-term environmentally just policies and processes.
Shifting development pathways entails fundamental changes in energy, urban, building, industrial, transport, and land-based systems. 
It also requires changes in behaviour and social practices. Overcoming inertia and locked-in practices may face considerable opposition 
(Geels et al. 2017) (Section  5.4.5). The durability of carbon intensive transport modes and electricity generating infrastructures 
increase the risk of lock-in to high emissions pathways, as these comprise not just consumer practices, but sunk costs in infrastructure, 
supporting institutions and rules (Seto et al. 2016; Mattioli et al. 2020). Shifting investments towards low-GHG solutions requires 
a combination of conducive public policies, attractive investment opportunities, as well as the availability of financing to enable such 
a transition (Section 15.3).
Cross-Chapter Box 5 (continued)
4. How to shift development pathways?
Shifting development paths is complex. If history is any guide, practices that can easily supplant existing systems and are clearly 
profitable move fastest (Griliches 1957). Changes that involve ‘dissimilar, unfamiliar and more complex science-based components’ 
take more time, acceptance and legitimation and involve complex social learning (Conley and Udry 2010), even when they promise 
large gains (Pezzoni et al. 2019).
Yet despite the complexities of the interactions that result in patterns of development, history also shows that societies can influence 
the direction of development pathways based on choices made by decision-makers, citizens, the private sector and social stakeholders. 
For example, fundamentally different responses to the first oil shock shifted then-comparable economies on to different energy sector 
development and economic pathways in the 1970s and 80s (Sathaye et al. 2009). More recent examples have shown evidence of 
voluntary transitions for example, advanced lighting in Sweden, improved cook-stoves in China, liquefied petroleum gas stoves in 
Indonesia or ethanol vehicles in Brazil (Sovacool 2016).
There is no one-size-fits-all recipe for shifting development pathways. However, the following insights can be drawn from past 
experience and scenarios of possible future development pathways (Section  4.4.1). For example, policies making inner-urban 
neighbourhoods more accessible and affordable reduce transport costs for low- and middle-income households, and also reduce 
transport emissions (Section 4.4.1.9). Shifts in development pathways result from both sustained political interventions and bottom-
up changes in public opinion. No single sector or policy action is enough to achieve this. Coordinated policy mixes would need to 
coordinate multiple actors – in other words, individuals, groups and collectives, corporate actors, institutions and infrastructure actors – 
to deepen decarbonisation and shift pathways towards sustainability (Pettifor 2020). One example was the liquefied petroleum gas 
(LPG) Subsidy (‘Zero Kero’) Program in Indonesia which harnessed creative policy design to shift to cleaner energy by overcoming 
existing private interests. The objective of decreasing fiscal expenditures on domestic kerosene subsidies by replacing it with LPG was 
achieved by harnessing distribution networks of existing providers supported by government subsidised provision of equipment and 
subsidised pricing (Cross-Chapter Box 9 in Chapter 13).
Shifts in one country may spill over to other countries. Collective action by individuals as part of formal social movements or informal 
lifestyle changes underpins system change (Sections 5.2.3, 5.4.1, 5.4.5.3 and 13.5).
Sectoral transitions that aspire to shift development pathways often have multiple objectives, and deploy a diverse mix or package of 
policies and institutional measures (Figure 13.6). Context specific governance conditions can significantly enable or disable sectoral 
transitions, and play a determinative role in whether a sectoral transition leads to a shift in development pathway. For example, 
if implemented policies to tackle fuel poverty target the most socially vulnerable households, this can help address barriers poor 
households face in undertaking building retrofits. In the EU-28, it has been shown that accelerated energy efficiency policies coupled 
with strong social policies targeting the most vulnerable households, can help reduce the energy demand in residential sector, and 
deliver additional co-benefits of avoided premature deaths and reduced health impacts (Section 9.8.2).
Literature suggests that through equitable resource distribution, high levels of human development can be provided at moderate 
energy and carbon levels by changing consumption patterns and redirecting systems in the direction of more sustainable resource use, 
suggesting that a special effort can be made in the near term for those on higher incomes who account for a disproportionate fraction 
of global emissions (Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020; Hickel et al. 2021) (Section 5.2.2 and Figure 5.14).
The necessary transformational changes are likely to be more acceptable if rooted in the development aspirations of the economy and 
society within which they take place (Dubash 2012; Jones et al. 2013) and may enable a new social contract to address a complex set 
of inter-linkages across sectors, classes and the whole economy (Fleurbaey et al. 2018).
Taking advantage of windows of opportunity and disruptions to mindsets and socio-technical systems could advance deeper 
transformations. These might include the globally declining costs of renewables (Figure 1.7, Section 2.2.5 and Box 16.2), emerging 
social norms for climate mitigation (Green and Denniss 2018), or the COVID-19 pandemic, all of which might be harnessed to centre 
political action on protecting human and planetary health (Büchs et al. 2020), but if not handled carefully could also risk undermining 
the support for transformation.
In sum, development pathways unfold over time in response to 
complex dynamics among various drivers and diverse actors with 
varying interests and motivations (high agreement, robust evidence). 
The way countries develop determines the nature and degree of the 
obstacles to accelerating mitigation and achieving other sustainable 
development objectives (medium-robust evidence, medium 
agreement). Meeting ambitious mitigation and development goals 
cannot be achieved through incremental change (robust evidence, 
medium agreement). Shifting development pathways thus involves 
designing and implementing policies where possible to intentionally 
enhance enabling conditions and reduce obstacles to desired 
outcomes (medium evidence, medium agreement).
Section  4.4 elaborates mechanisms through which societies can 
develop and implement policies to substantially shift development 
pathways toward securing shared societal objectives. Such policies 
entail overcoming obstacles (Section 4.2.7) by means of favourable 
enabling conditions: governance and institutions, behaviour, 
innovation, policy and finance. These enabling conditions are 
amenable to intentional change – to greater or lesser degrees and 
over longer or shorter time scales – based on a range of possible 
measures and processes (Section 4.4).4.4 How to Shift Development Pathways 
and Accelerate the Pace and 
Scale of Mitigation
4.4.1 Approaches, Enabling Conditions and Examples
4.4.1.1 Framing the Problem
What have we learned so far? As highlighted above, despite 30 years 
of UNFCCC and growing contributions by non-state actors, the 
emissions gap keeps growing (Sections 4.2.2 and 4.2.3). Mitigation 
conceived as incremental change is not enough. Meeting ambitious 
mitigation goals entails rapid, non-marginal changes in production 
and consumption patterns (Sections 4.2.4 and 4.2.5). Taking another 
approach, we have seen in Section  4.3 that shifting development 
pathways broadens the scope for mitigation (Sections  4.3.1 
and 4.3.2) and offers more opportunities than mitigation alone to 
combine mitigation with the realisation of other SDGs (Section 4.3.1 
and Cross-Chapter Box 5 in this chapter).
A practical way forward is to combine shifting development 
pathways and accelerating mitigation (medium evidence, high 
agreement). This means introducing multi-objective policy packages 
and sequences with climate and development components that 
both target mitigation directly and create the conditions for shifts in 
development pathways that will help accelerate further mitigation 
down the line, and meet other development objectives. Since 
development pathways result from myriad decisions from multiple 
actors (Section 4.3.1), coordination across countries and with non-
state actors is essential.Cross-Chapter Box 5 (continued)
5. How can shifts in development pathways be implemented by actors in different contexts?
Shifting development pathways to increased sustainability is a  shared aspiration. Yet since countries differ in starting points 
(e.g., social, economic, cultural, political) and history, they have different urgent needs in terms of facilitating the economic, social, 
and environmental dimensions of sustainable development and, therefore, give different priorities (Sections 4.3.2 and 17.4). The 
appropriate set of policies to shift development pathways thus depends on national circumstances and capacities.
In some developed countries and communities, affluence leads to high levels of consumption and emissions across sectors (Mazur 
and Rosa 1974; Wiedmann et al. 2020). For some countries, reducing consumption can reduce emissions without compromising on 
wellbeing. However, some developing countries still face the challenge of escaping ‘middle-income traps’ (Agénor and Canuto 2015), 
as labour-saving technological change and globalisation have limited options to develop via the manufacturing sector (Altenburg 
and Rodrik 2017). In least developed countries, infrastructure, industry, and public services are still being established, posing both 
a challenge to financial support to deploy technologies, and large opportunities to support accelerating low-to-zero carbon options – 
especially in terms of efficient and sufficient provision (Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020). Availability of capital, or lack thereof, is a critical 
discriminant across countries and requires international cooperation (Section 15.2.2).
Shifting development pathways towards sustainability needs to be supported by global partnerships to strengthen suitable capacity, 
technological innovation (Section  16.6), and financial flows (Sections  14.4.1, 15.2.4). The international community can play 
a particularly key role by helping ensure the necessary broad participation in climate-mitigation efforts, including by countries at 
different development levels, through sustained support for policies and partnerships that support shifting development pathways 
towards sustainability while promoting equity and being mindful of different transition capacities (Sections  4.3.2, 16.5, 16.6, 
14.4 and 17.4).
The literature does not provide a handbook on how to accomplish the 
above. However, analysis of past experience as well as understanding 
of how societies function yield insights that the present section aims 
at presenting. Human history has seen multiple transformation of 
economies due to path-breaking innovations (Michaelowa et al. 
2018), like the transformation of the energy system from traditional 
biomass to fossil fuels or from steam to electricity (Fouquet 2010, 
2016a; Sovacool 2016). Fouquet (2016b) and Smil (2016) argue 
that even the most rapid global transformations have taken several 
decades. Enabling transformational change implies to create now 
the conditions that lead to that transformation (Díaz et al. 2019). 
The starting point is that there is no single factor determining such 
a transformation. Rather a range of enabling conditions can combine 
in a co-evolutionary process. Amongst the conditions that have been 
cited in the literature are higher levels of innovation, multilevel 
governance, transformative policy regimes or profound behavioural 
transformation (Rockström et al. 2017; IPCC 2018a; Geels et al. 2018; 
Kriegler et al. 2018). It might be possible to put in place some of 
the above conditions rapidly, while others may take longer, thereby 
requiring an early start.
The present chapter uses the set of enabling conditions identified in 
the IPCC SR1.5 report, namely policy, governance and institutional 
capacity, finance, behaviour and lifestyles and innovation and 
technology (de Coninck et al. 2018). As Figure  4.8 illustrates, 
public policies are required to foster both accelerating mitigation 
and shifting development pathways. They are also vital to guide 
and provide the other enabling conditions (compare Table  4.12). 
Improved governance and enhanced institutional capacity facilitate 
the adoption of policies that accelerate mitigation and shift 
development pathways, with the potential to achieve multiple 
mitigation and development objectives. Finance is required both to 
accelerate mitigation and to shift development pathways. Chapter 15 argues that near term actions to shift the financial system over the 
next decade (2021–2030) are critically important and feasible, and 
that the immediate post-COVID recovery opens up opportunities 
to scale up financing from billions to trillions (Mawdsley 2018) 
(Section 15.6.7). As discussed in Section 4.2.5, accelerated mitigation 
pathways encompass both rapid deployment of new technologies 
such as CCS or electric vehicles, as well as changes in consumption 
patterns: rapid deployment of mitigation technology and behaviour 
change are thus two enabling conditions to accelerated mitigation. 
Dynamics of deployment of technologies are relatively well known, 
pointing to specific, short-term action to accelerate innovation and 
deployment (Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 16), whereas dynamics 
of collective behaviour change is less well understood. Arguably, the 
latter also facilitates shifting development pathways.
Individual enabling conditions are discussed at length in 
Chapter  5  (behaviour change), 13 (policies, governance and 
institutional capacity), 15 (finance) and 16 (innovation). The purpose 
of the discussion below is to draw operational implications from 
these chapters for action, taking into account the focus of the present 
Chapter on action at the national level in the near- and mid-term, and 
its special emphasis on shifting development pathways in addition to 
accelerated mitigation.
The rest of the Section is organised as follows. Policy packages 
that combine climate and development policies are first 
discussed  (Section  4.4.1.2). The next sections are dedicated to 
the conditions that facilitate shifts in development pathways 
and accelerated mitigation: governance and institutions 
(Section  4.4.1.3), financial resources (Section  4.4.1.4), behaviour 
change (Section  4.4.1.5) and innovation  (Section  4.4.1.6). Four 
examples of how climate and development policies can be combined 
to shift pathways and accelerate mitigation are then presented

(Sections 4.4.1.7, 4.4.1.8, 4.4.1.9 and 4.4.1.10). Section 4.4.2 focuses 
specifically on how shifts in development pathways can deliver both 
mitigation and adaptation. Finally, Section  4.4.3 discusses risks 
and uncertainties associated with combining shifting development 
pathways and accelerating mitigation.
4.4.1.2 Policy Packages That Include Climate 
and Development Policies
Although many transformations in the past have been driven by 
the emergence and diffusion of an innovative technology, policy 
intervention was frequent, especially in the more rapid ones 
(Michaelowa et al. 2018; Grubb et al. 2021). Likewise, it is not 
expected that spontaneous behaviour change or market evolution 
alone yield the type of transformations outlined in the accelerated 
mitigation pathways described in Section  4.2.5, or in the shifts in 
development pathways described in Section 4.3.3. On the contrary, 
stringent temperature targets imply bold policies in the short term 
(Rockström et al. 2017; Kriegler et al. 2018) to enforce effective 
existing policy instruments and regulations, as well as to reform or 
remove harmful existing policies and subsidies (Díaz et al. 2019).
Policy integration, addressing multiple objectives, is an essential 
component of shifting development pathways and accelerating 
mitigation (robust evidence, high agreement). A shift in development 
pathways that fosters accelerated mitigation may best be achieved 
through integrated actions that comprise policies in support of 
the broader SDG agenda, based on country-specific priorities 
(Sections  4.3.2, 13.8 and 13.9). These may include for example, 
fiscal policies, or integrating industrial (Nilsson et al. 2021) and 
energy policies (Fragkos et al. 2021) with climate policies. Similarly, 
sectoral transitions that aspire to shifting development pathways 
towards sustainability often have multiple objectives, and deploy 
a  diverse mix or package of policies and institutional measures 
(Cross-Chapter Box 5).
Because low-carbon transitions are political processes, analyses 
are needed of policy as well as for policy (Section  13.6). Political 
scientists have developed a number of theoretical models that both 
explain policy-making processes and provide useful insights for 
influencing those processes. Case studies of successes and failures 
in sustainable development and mitigation offer equally important 
insights. Both theoretical and empirical analysis reinforce the 
argument that single policy instruments are not sufficient (robust 
evidence, high agreement). Policymakers might rather mobilise 
a range of policies, such as financial instruments (taxes, subsidies, 
grants, loans), regulatory instruments (standards, laws, performance 
targets) and processual instruments (demonstration projects, network 
management, public debates, consultations, foresight exercises, 
roadmaps) (Voß et al. 2007). Policies can be designed to focus on 
limiting or phasing out high-carbon technology. The appropriate mix is 
likely to vary between countries and domains, depending on political 
cultures and stakeholder configurations (Rogge and Reichardt 2016), 
but is likely to include a combination of: (i) standards, nudges and 
information to encourage low-carbon technology adoption and 
behavioural change; (ii) economic incentives to reward low-carbon 
investments; (iii) supply-side policy instruments including for fossil fuel production (to complement demand-side climate policies) 
and (iv) innovation support and strategic investment to encourage 
systemic change (Grubb 2014). These approaches can be mutually 
reinforcing. For example, carbon pricing can incentivise low-carbon 
innovation, while targeted support for emerging niche technologies 
can make them more competitive encourage their diffusion and 
ultimately facilitate a  higher level of carbon pricing. Similarly, the 
success of feed-in tariffs in Germany only worked as well as it did 
because it formed part of a broader policy mix including ‘supply-push’ 
mechanisms such as subsidies for research and ‘systemic measures’ 
such as collaborative research projects and systems of knowledge 
exchange (Rogge et al. 2015).
4.4.1.3 Governance and Institutional Capacity
Governance for climate mitigation and shifting development pathways 
is enhanced when tailored to national and local contexts. Improved 
institutions and governance enable ambitious climate action and help 
bridge implementation gaps (medium evidence, high agreement). 
Improving institutions involve a  broad range of stakeholders and 
multiple regional and temporal scales. It necessitates a  credible 
and trusted process for reconciling perspectives and balancing 
potential side-effects, managing winners and losers and adopting 
compensatory measures to ensure an inclusive and just transition 
(Newell and Mulvaney 2013; Miller and Richter 2014; Gambhir et al. 
2018; Diffenbaugh and Burke 2019), managing the risk of inequitable 
or non-representative power dynamics and avoiding regulatory 
capture by special interests (Helsinki Design Lab 2011; Boulle et al. 
2015; Kahane 2012).
Long experience of political management of change demonstrates 
that managing such risks is not easy, and requires sufficiently strong 
and competent institutions (Stiglitz 1998). For example, shift away 
from fossil fuel-based energy economy could significantly disrupt the 
status quo, leading to a stranding of financial and capital assets and 
shifting of political-economic power. Ensuring the decision-making 
process is not unduly influenced by actors with much to lose is key 
to managing a  transformation. Effective governance, as noted in 
Chapter 13, requires establishing strategic direction, coordination of 
policy responses, and mediation among divergent interests. Among 
varieties of climate governance, which institutions emerge is path-
dependent, based on the interplay of national political institutions, 
international drivers, and bureaucratic structures (Dubash 2021). 
Focused national climate institutions to address these challenges 
are more likely to emerge, persist and be effective when they 
are consistent with a  framing of climate change that has broad 
national political support (medium evidence, medium agreement) 
(Sections 4.5, 13.2 and 13.5).
Innovative governance approaches can help meet these challenges 
(Clark et al. 2018; Díaz et al. 2019). Enabling multilevel governance  – 
i.e., better alignment across governance scales – and coordination 
of international organisations and national governments can 
help accelerate a  transition to sustainable development and deep 
decarbonisation (Tait and Euston-Brown 2017; Michaelowa and 
Michaelowa 2017; Ringel 2017; Revi 2017; Cheshmehzangi 2016; 
IPCC 2018a). Participatory and inclusive governance  – partnerships 
between state and non-state actors, and concerted effort across 
different stakeholders are crucial in supporting acceleration (Burch 
et al. 2014; Hering et al. 2014; Roberts 2016; Figueres et al. 2017; 
Clark et al. 2018; Leal Filho et al. 2018; Lee et al. 2018). So do 
partnerships through transnational climate governance initiatives, 
which coordinate nation states and non-state actors on an 
international scale (Hsu et al. 2018). Although they are unlikely 
to close the gap of the insufficient mitigation effort of national 
governments (Michaelowa and Michaelowa 2017) (Section  4.2.3), 
they help building confidence in governments concerning climate 
policy and push for more ambitious national goals (UNEP 2018b).
Meeting these challenges also requires enhanced institutional 
capacity and enhanced institutional mechanisms to strengthen the 
coordination between multiple actors, improve complementarities 
and synergies between multiple objectives (Rasul 2016; Ringel 2017; 
Liu et al. 2018) and pursue climate action and other development 
objectives in an integrated and coherent way (Von Stechow et al. 
2016; McCollum et al. 2018; Rogelj et al. 2018b; Roy et al. 2018; Fuso 
Nerini et al. 2019), particularly in developing countries (Adenle et al. 
2017; Rosenbloom 2017). Institutional capacities to be strengthened 
include vertical collaboration and interaction within nation states 
and horizontal collaboration (e.g.,  transnational city networks) for 
the development and implementation of plans, regulations and 
policies. More specifically capacities include: capacity for knowledge 
harnessing and integration (from multiple perspectives); for 
integrated policy design and implementation (Scott 2017); for long-
term planning (Lecocq et al. 2021) for monitoring and review process; 
for coordinating multi-actor processes to create synergies and avoid 
trade-offs. As a result, institutions that enable and improve human 
capacities and capabilities are a major driver of transformation. To 
this extent, promoting education, health care and social safety, also 
are instrumental to undertake climate change mitigation and cope 
with environmental problems (Winkler et al. 2007; Sachs et al. 2019). 
Given that strengthening institutions may be a long-term endeavour, 
it needs attention in the near term.
4.4.1.4 Channelling Financial Resources
Accelerated mitigation and shifting development pathways 
necessitate both redirecting existing financial flows from high- to 
low-emissions technologies and systems and providing additional 
resources (robust evidence, high agreement). An example is changes 
in investments from fossil fuels to renewable energy, with pressures 
to disinvest in the former while increasing levels of ‘green finance’ 
(Sections  6.7.4 and 15.5). While some lower-carbon technologies 
have become competitive (Sections 1.4.3 and 2.5), support remains 
needed for the low-emissions options have higher costs per unit of 
service provided than high-emission ones. Lack of financial resources 
is identified as a major barrier to the implementation of accelerated 
mitigation and of shifts in development pathways. Overcoming this 
obstacle has two major components. One relates to private capital. 
The other to public finance.
There is substantial amount of research on the redirection of private 
financial flows towards low-carbon investment and the role of financial regulators and central banks, as detailed in Chapter  15. 
Financial systems are an indispensable element of a  systemic 
transition (Fankhauser et al. 2016; Naidoo 2020). Policy frameworks 
can redirect financial resources towards low-emission assets 
and services (UNEP 2015), mainstreaming climate finance within 
financial and banking system regulation, and reducing transaction 
costs for bankable mitigation technology projects (Mundaca et al. 
2013; Brunner and Enting 2014; Yeo 2019). Shifts in the financial 
system to finance climate mitigation and other SDGs can be achieved 
by aligning incentives and investments with multiple objectives 
(UNEP Inquiry 2016).
Different approaches have been explored to improve such alignment 
(Section  15.6), from national credit policies to directly green 
mainstream financial regulations (e.g., through modifications in the 
Basel rules for banks). For all approaches, an essential precondition 
is to assess and monitor the contribution of financial flows to climate 
and sustainability goals, with better metrics that clearly link with 
financial activity (Chenet et al. 2019). Enabling the alignment of 
investment decision-making with achieving climate and broader 
sustainability goals includes acknowledgment and disclosure of 
climate-change related risk and of risks associated with mitigation 
in financial portfolios. Current disclosures remain far from the 
scale the markets need to channel investment to sustainable and 
resilient solutions (UNEP - Finance Initiative 2020; Clark et al. 2018; 
Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures 2019; IPCC 
2018b). Disclosure, however, is not enough (Ameli et al. 2020). 
In addition, climate targets can be translated into investment 
roadmaps and financing needs for financial institutions, both at 
national and international level. Financing needs are usable for 
financial institutions, to inform portfolio allocation decisions and 
financing priorities (Chenet et al. 2019). At the international level, 
for example, technology roadmaps for key sectors can be translated 
into investment roadmaps and financing needs, as shown by existing 
experiences in energy and industrial sectors (IEA 2015; IEA and 
WBSCD 2018; Chenet et al. 2019).
The transition from traditional public climate finance interventions 
to the market-based support of climate mitigation (Bodnar et al. 2018) 
demands innovative forms of financial cooperation and innovative 
financing mechanisms to help de-risk low-emission investments 
and support new business models. These financial innovations may 
involve sub-national actors like cities and regional governments 
in raising finance to achieve their commitments (Cartwright 2015; 
CCFLA 2017). Moreover, public-private partnerships have proved to 
be an important vehicle for financing investments to meet the SDGs, 
including economic instruments for financing conservation (Sovacool 
2013; Díaz et al. 2019).
Overall, early action is needed to overcome barriers and to adjust the 
existing incentive system to align national development strategies 
with climate and sustainable development goals in the medium-
term. Steckel et al. (2017) conclude that climate finance could 
become a  central pillar of sustainable development by reconciling 
the global goal of cost-efficient mitigation with national policy 
priorities. Without a more rapid, scaled redeployment of financing, 
in development trajectories that hinder the realisation of the global 
goals will be locked in (Zadek and Robins 2016). Investment might 
be designed to avoid trading off the Paris goals against other SDGs, 
as well as those that simultaneously reduce poverty, inequality, and 
emissions (Fuso Nerini et al. 2019).
At the national level, it is also essential to create public fiscal space 
for actions promoting the SDG agenda and thereby broadening the 
scope of mitigation (medium evidence, medium agreement). To do 
so, pricing carbon – either through tax payments based on the level 
of emissions or cap-and-trade systems that limit total allowable 
emissions – is an efficient means of discouraging carbon emissions 
throughout an economy (both in consumption and production) while 
simultaneously encouraging a switch to non-carbon energy sources 
and generating revenues for prioritised actions (Section  13.6.3). 
Regarding to levels, the High-Level Commission on Carbon Prices 
concluded that ‘carbon-price level consistent with achieving the Paris 
temperature target is at least USD40–80 tCO 2–1 by 2020 and USD50–

place’ (CPLC 2017; Wall Street Journal 2019). National level models 
yield median carbon values of carbon values of USD733 tCO 2–1 in 

global models find a median value of USD578 tCO 2–1 for pathways 
that reach net zero CO 2 between 2045 and 2055 [interquartile range 
USD405–708] (Section 3.6.1).
Carbon pricing, however, is designed to reduce its fiscal base. 
Fiscal space may therefore also need to stem from other sources, 
although fiscal reforms are complex endeavours (Section 4.4.1.8). For 
countries at lower income levels, foreign aid can make an important 
contribution to the same agenda (Kharas and McArthur 2019). It may 
also be noted that, according to estimates at the global level, military 
spending amounted to USD1.748 trillion in 2012 (the last year with 
data), a figure that corresponded to 2.3% of GDP , 55% of government 
spending in education, and was 13 times the level of net ODA (World 
Bank 2020; SIPRI 2020). Given this, moderate reductions in military 
spending (which may involve conflict resolution and cross-country 
agreements on arms limitations) could free up considerable resources 
for the SDG agenda, both in the countries that reduce spending and 
in the form of ODA. The resolution of conflicts within and between 
countries before they become violent would also reduce the need for 
public and private spending repairing human and physical damage. 
The fact that civil wars are common in the countries that face the 
severest SDG challenges underscores the importance of this issue 
(Collier 2007, pp.17–37).
4.4.1.5 Changing Behaviour and Lifestyles
Changes in behaviour and lifestyles are important to accelerated 
mitigation. Most global mitigation pathways that limit warming to 
2°C (>67%) or lower assume substantial behavioural and societal 
change and low-carbon lifestyles (de Coninck et al. 2018; IPCC 
2018a; Luderer et al. 2018a) (see also Section 3.3.1 in this report; 
and Table  4.9 and Figure  4.3 in IPCC SR1.5). Chapter  5  concludes 
that behavioural changes within transition pathways offer Gigaton-
scale CO 2 savings potential at the global level, an often overlooked 
strategy in traditional mitigation scenarios.Individual motivation and capacity are impacted by different factors 
that go beyond traditional social, demographic and economic 
predictors. However, it is unclear to what extent behavioural factors 
(i.e., cognitive, motivational and contextual aspects) are taken into 
account in policy design (Dubois et al. 2019; Mundaca et al. 2019). 
In fact, while economic policies play a significant role in influencing 
people’s decisions and behaviour, many drivers of human behaviour 
and values work largely outside the market system (Winkler et al. 
2015; Díaz et al. 2019) as actors in society, particularly individuals, do 
not respond in an economically ‘rational’ manner based on perfect-
information cost-benefit analyses (Runge 1984; Shiller 2019). Rather, 
compelling narratives can drive individuals to adopt new norms and 
policies. And norms can be more quickly and more robustly shifted 
by proposing and framing policies designed with awareness of how 
framings interact with individual cognitive tendencies (van der Linden 
et al. 2015). Transformative policies are thus much more likely to be 
successfully adopted and lead to long-term behavioural change if 
designed in accordance with principles of cognitive psychology (van 
der Linden et al. 2015), and with the deep understanding of decision-
making offered by behavioural science (UNEP 2017b). Similarly, given 
that present bias – being motivated by costs and benefits that take 
effect immediately than those delivered later  – significantly shapes 
behaviour, schemes that bring forward distant costs into the present or 
that upfront incentives have proved to be more effective (Zauberman 
et al. 2009; van den Broek et al. 2017; Safarzyńska 2018). Overall, 
transformational strategies that align mitigation with subjective life 
satisfaction, and build societal support by positive discourses about 
economic, social, and cultural benefits of low-carbon innovations, 
promises far more success than targeting mitigation alone (WBGU 
2011; Asensio and Delmas 2016; Geels et al. 2017).
Climate actions are related to knowledge but even strongly to 
motivational factors (Hornsey et al. 2016; Bolderdijk et al. 2013; 
Boomsma and Steg 2014), which explains the gap between awareness 
and action (Ünal et al. 2018). Social influences, particularly from peers, 
affect people’s engagement in climate action (Schelly 2014). Role 
models appear to have a solid basis in people’s everyday preferences 
(WBGU 2011). Social norms can reinforce individuals’ underlying 
motivations and be effective in encouraging sustainable consumption 
patterns, as many examples offered by behavioural science illustrate. 
Social networks also influence and spread behaviours (Service et al. 
2014; Clayton et al. 2015; Farrow et al. 2017; Shah et al. 2019). These 
social influences can be harnessed by climate policy.
Collective action by individuals as part of formal social movements 
or informal lifestyle movements underpins system change (robust 
evidence, high agreement) (Sections 5.4 and 5.5). Organisations are 
comprised of individuals, but also become actors in their own right. 
Recent literature has considered the role of coalitions and social 
movements in energy democracy and energy transitions towards 
sustainability (Hess 2018). Other scholars have examined the role of 
women in redistributing power, both in the sense of energy transition 
and in terms of gender relations (Allen et al. 2019; Routledge et al. 
2018). Mitigation and broader sustainable development policies that 
facilitate active participation by stakeholders can build trust, forge 
new social contracts, and contribute to a  positive cycle building 
climate governance capacity (Section 5.2.3).
However, behavioural change not embedded in structural change 
will contribute little to climate change mitigation, suggesting that 
behavioural change is not only a  function of individual agency 
but also depends on other enabling factors, such as the provision 
of infrastructure and institutions (Section  5.4). Successful shifts 
towards public transport, for example, involve technologies (buses, 
trams), infrastructure (light rail, dedicated bus lanes), regulations 
(operational licenses, performance contracts), institutions (new 
organisations, responsibilities, oversight), and high-enough density, 
which in turn depends on such choices as housing or planning 
policies (Section 4.4.1.9).
4.4.1.6 Fostering Technological Innovation
As outlined in Section 4.2.5, rapid, large-scale deployment of improved 
low-carbon technology is a  critical component of accelerated 
mitigation pathways. As part of its key role in technological 
change, R&D can make a crucial contribution to accelerated mitigation 
up to 2030 and beyond, among other things by focusing on closing 
technology gaps that stand in the way of decarbonising today’s high 
emitting sectors. Such sectors include shipping, trucking, aviation 
and heavy industries like steel, cement and chemicals. More broadly, 
it is increasingly clear that digital changes are becoming a key driving 
force in societal transformation (Tegmark 2017). Digitalisation is not 
only an ‘instrument’ for resolving sustainability challenges, it is also 
a fundamental driver of disruptive, multiscalar change (Sachs et al. 
2019) that amounts to a shift in development pathway. Information 
and communication technologies, artificial intelligence, the internet 
of things, nanotechnologies, biotechnologies, robotics, are not usually 
categorised as climate technologies, but have a potential impact on 
GHG emissions (OECD 2017b) (Cross-Chapter Box 11 in Chapter 16).
The direction of innovation matters (robust evidence, high agreement). 
The research community has called for more ‘responsible innovation’ 
(Pandza and Ellwood 2013), ‘open innovation’ (Rauter et al. 2019), 
‘mission-oriented’ innovation (Mazzucato and Semieniuk 2017), 
‘holistic innovation’ (Chen et al. 2018b), ‘next-generation innovation 
policy’ (Kuhlmann and Rip 2018) or ‘transformative innovation’ (Schot 
and Steinmueller 2018) so that innovation patterns and processes 
are commensurate to our growing sustainability challenges. There 
is a  growing recognition that new forms of innovation can be 
harnessed and coupled to climate objectives (Fagerberg et al. 2016; 
Wang et al. 2018). As such, innovation and socio-technical change 
can be channelled to intensify mitigation via ‘deliberate acceleration’ 
(Roberts et al. 2018a) and ‘coalition building’ (Hess 2018).
Innovation goes beyond technology. For example, decarbonisation in 
sectors with long lived capital stock (such as heavy industry, buildings, 
transport infrastructure) entail technology, policy and financing 
innovations (Bataille 2020). Similarly, expanding the deployment 
of  photovoltaics can draw upon policies that support specific 
technical innovations (e.g., to improve photovoltaics efficiency), or 
innovations in regulatory and market regimes (e.g.,  net-metering), 
to innovations in social organisation (e.g.,  community-ownership). 
System innovation is a core focus of the transitions literature (Grin 
et al. 2010; Markard et al. 2012; Geels et al. 2017). Accelerating low-carbon transitions not only involves a shift of system elements but 
also underlying routines and rules, and hence transitions shift the 
directionality of innovation. They hence concern the development 
of a  new paradigm or regime that is more focused on solving 
sustainability challenges that cannot be solved within the dominant 
regime they substitute (Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 16).
Several studies have pointed at the important possible contributions 
of grassroots innovators for the start-up of sustainability transitions 
(Seyfang and Smith 2007; Seyfang et al. 2014; Smith et al. 2016). In 
particular, a range of studies have shown that users can play a variety 
of roles in promoting system innovation: shielding, nurturing (including 
learning, networking and visioning) and empowering the niches 
in relation to the dominant system and regime (Schot et al. 2016; 
Randelli and Rocchi 2017; Meelen et al. 2019). More fundamentally, 
innovation regimes can be led and guided by markets driven by 
monetisable profits (as much of private sector led technological 
innovation of patentable  intellectual property), or prioritise social 
returns (e.g.,  innovation structures such as innovation prizes, public 
sector innovation, investments in human capital, and socially-beneficial 
intellectual property regimes). In both cases, public policies can play 
a key role by providing resources and favourable incentives (IEA 2020). 
Chapter 16 provides more details on ways to foster innovation.
4.4.1.7 Example: Structural Change Provides a Way to Keep 
Jobs and Mitigate
Developing countries have experienced a period of rapid economic 
growth in the past two decades. Patterns of growth have differed 
markedly across regions, with newly emerging East Asian economies 
building on transition to manufacturing – as China has done in the 
past – while Latin American countries tend to transition directly from 
primary sector to services (Rodrik 2016), and African countries tend 
to rely on productivity improvements in the primary sectors (Diao 
et al. 2019). Yet many countries still face the challenge of getting out 
of the ‘middle-income trap’ (Agénor and Canuto 2015), as labour-
saving technological change and globalisation have limited options 
to develop via the manufacturing sector (Altenburg and Rodrik 2017).
Looking ahead, several studies have illustrated how structural 
change towards sustainability could lead to reduced emissions 
intensity and higher mitigative capacity. In China, for example, 
the shift away from heavy industry (to light industry and services) 
has already been identified as the most important force limiting 
emissions growth (Guan et al. 2018), and as a major factor for future 
emissions (Kwok et al. 2018).
Overall, Altenburg et al. (2017) argue that reallocation of capital 
and labour from low- to high-productivity sectors – in other words, 
structural change  – remains a  necessity, and that it is possible to 
combine it with reduced environmental footprint (including, but not 
limited to, mitigation). They argue that this dual challenge calls for 
structural transformation policies different from those implemented 
in the past, most importantly through a  ‘systematic steering of 
investment behaviour in a socially agreed direction’ and encompassing 
policy coordination (limited evidence, medium agreement).
In order to permit progress on their SDG agendas, it is essential 
that countries develop visions of their future decarbonised sectoral 
production structure, including its ability to generate growth in 
incomes, employment and foreign exchange earnings. as well as the 
related spatial distribution of production, employment, and housing. 
To this extent, governance and institutional capacity matter, such as 
availability of tools to support long-term planning. A sectoral structure 
that permits strong growth is essential given strong associations 
between growth in per-capita incomes and progress on most SDGs 
(including those related to poverty; health; education; and access to 
water, sanitation, electricity, and roads; but not income equality), in 
part due to the fact that higher incomes provide both households 
and governments with resources that at least in part would be used 
to promote SDGs (Gable et al. 2015).
The future viability of sectors will depend on the extent to which 
they can remain profitable while relying on lower-carbon energy. 
The challenge to identify alternative sectors of growth is particularly 
acute for countries that today depend on oil and natural gas for 
most of their foreign exchange and government revenues (Mirzoev 
et al. 2020). Changes in economic structure will also have gender 
implications since the roles of men and women vary across sectors. 
For example, in many developing countries, sectors in which women 
play a  relatively important role, including agriculture and unpaid 
household services like collection of water and fuel wood, may be 
negatively affected by climate change (Roy 2018). It may thus be 
important to take complementary actions to address the gender 
implications of changes in economic structure.
Given strong complementarities between policies discussed above, 
an integrated policy approach is crucial. For example, as suggested, 
the actions that influence the pace at which GHG emissions can be 
cut with political support may depend on taxation (including carbon 
taxes), investments in infrastructure, spending on R&D, changes in 
income distribution (influenced by transfers), and communication. 
In this light, it is important to consider the demands that alternative 
policy packages put on government policy-making efficiency and 
credibility as well as the roles of other enabling conditions. In fact, 
plans to undertake major reforms may provide governments with 
impetus to accelerate the enhancement of their capacities as part 
of the preparations (Karapin 2016; Withana 2016; Jakob et al. 2019).
4.4.1.8 Example: Embedding Carbon Finance in Broader 
Fiscal Reforms Offers a Way to Mitigate and Rethink 
the Social Contract
In many countries, fiscal systems are currently under stress to provide 
resources for the implementation of development priorities, such as, 
for example, providing universal health coverage and other social 
services (Meheus and McIntyre 2017) or sustainably funding pension 
systems in the context of aging populations (Asher and Bali 2017; 
Cruz-Martinez 2018). Overall, Baum et al. (2017) argue that low-
income countries are likely not to have the fiscal space to undertake 
the investment entailed in reaching the SDGs. To create additional 
fiscal space, major options include improving tax recovery, reducing 
subsidies and levying additional taxes.Mitigation offers an opportunity to create additional fiscal space, and 
thus to serve the objectives outlined above, by creating a new source 
of revenue for the government via carbon taxation or emissions 
permit auctioning and by reducing existing expenditures via reduction 
in subsidies to fossil-fuel. The 1991 tax reform in Sweden is an early 
example in which environmental taxation (including, but not limited 
to, fossil fuel taxation) was introduced as part of a package primarily 
aimed at lowering the marginal tax rates (more than 80% at the 
time), at reducing other taxes, while keeping most of the welfare 
state. To do so, the tax base was broadened, including through 
environmental and carbon taxation (Sterner 2007). Once in place, the 
carbon tax rate was substantially ramped up over time, and its base 
broadened (Criqui et al. 2019).
The future potential for using carbon taxation as a way to provide 
space for fiscal reform has been highlighted in the so-called ‘green 
fiscal reform’ literature (Vogt-Schilb et al. 2019). The potential is 
large, since only 13% of global GHG emissions were covered by 
carbon pricing schemes in 2019 (Watts et al. 2019) and since many 
countries price carbon negatively by subsidising fossil fuel use, thus 
generating effects that are the opposite of those that positive carbon 
prices hope to promote. In 2018, the global subsidy value amounted 
to USD427 billion, some 10 times the payment for carbon use (Watts 
et al. 2019). However, the size of the potential for creating fiscal 
space varies strongly across countries given differences in terms of 
current carbon prices and fuel subsidies.
The limited adoption of and political support for carbon pricing 
may be explained by the fact that most of the gains occur in the 
future and depend on actions across the globe, making them 
seem abstract and unpredictable, whereas the costs in the form of 
higher carbon prices are immediate (Karapin 2016). Furthermore, 
the links between carbon pricing and emissions may not be clear 
to the public who, in addition, may not trust that the government 
will use budgetary savings according to stated plans. The latter may 
be due to various factors, including a history of limited government 
commitment and corruption (Withana 2016; Chadwick 2017; 
Maestre-Andrés et al. 2019).
The literature reports limited systematic evidence based on ex post 
analysis of the performance of carbon pricing  – carbon taxes and 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions trading systems (ETSs) (Haites 
2018). Performance assessment is complicated by the effect of other 
policies and exogenous factors. Haites (2018) suggests that since 
2008, other policies have probably contributed more to emission 
reductions than carbon taxes, and most tax rates are too low to 
achieve mitigation objectives. Emissions under ETSs have declined, 
with the exception of four systems without emissions caps (ibid). 
Every jurisdiction with an ETS and/or carbon tax also has other 
policies that affect its GHG emissions.
To help policymakers overcome obstacles, research has reviewed the 
international experience from carbon pricing reforms. Elimination 
of fossil fuel subsidies, equivalent to the elimination of negative 
carbon prices, have been more successful when they have included 
complementary and transparent measures that enjoy popular 
support, accompanied by a strong communications component that 
explains the measures and stresses their benefits (Withana 2016; 
Rentschler and Bazilian 2017; Maestre-Andrés et al. 2019).
Part of the losses (and related calls for compensation or exemptions) 
due to carbon pricing are related to the fact that it hurts the 
competitiveness of sectors that face imports from countries with 
lower carbon prices, leading to ‘carbon leakage’ if carbon-intensive 
production (and related jobs) migrates from countries with relatively 
high carbon prices. Some research suggests that evidence that 
a border carbon tax (or adjustment), set on the basis of the carbon 
content of the import, including a downward adjustment on the basis 
of any carbon payments (taxes or other) already made before entry, 
could reduce carbon leakage while also raising additional revenue 
and encouraging carbon pricing in the exporting country (Withana 
2016; Cosbey et al. 2019).
The timing of carbon pricing reforms is also important: they are more 
likely to succeed if they exploit windows of opportunity provided 
by events that raise awareness of the costs of carbon emissions 
(like bouts of elevated local air pollution or reports about the role 
of emissions in causing global warming), as well as momentum 
from climate actions by other countries and international climate 
agreements (Karapin 2016; Jakob et al.2019). It is also important 
to consider the level of international prices of carbon energy: when 
they are low, consumer resistance would be smaller since prices 
will remain relatively low, though the tax may become more visible 
when energy prices increase again. As part of ongoing efforts 
to accelerate mitigation, such tax hikes may be crucial to avoid 
a  slow down in the shift to renewable energy sources (Withana 
2016; Rentschler and Bazilian 2017). In countries that export 
carbon energy, carbon taxation may run into additional resistance 
from producers.
There is also considerable literature providing insights on the political 
and social acceptability of carbon taxes, suggesting for example 
that political support may be boosted if the revenue is recycled to 
the tax payers or earmarked for areas with positive environmental 
effects (e.g., Bachus et al. (2019) for Belgium, and Beiser-McGrath 
and Bernauer (2019) for Germany and the USA), as well as on 
the difficulties associated with political vagaries (and economic 
consequences thereof) associated with the introduction of such 
instruments (Pereira et al. 2016). Similarly, ‘best practices’ have been 
drawn from past experience on fossil-fuel subsidy reforms (Rentschler 
and Bazilian 2017; Sovacool 2017). Specific policies, however, 
depend on societal objectives, endowments, structure of production, 
employment, and trade, and institutional structure (including the 
functioning of markets and government capacity) (Kettner et al. 
2019). As noted in Section 4.2.6, macroeconomic analysis finds that 
the overall economic implications of carbon pricing differ markedly 
depending on the way the proceeds from carbon pricing are used, 
and thus on the way the fiscal system is reformed, with potential for 
double dividend if the proceeds from the tax are used to repeal the 
most distortive taxes in the economy.
In the context of this section on development pathways, it is 
worth emphasising that potential revenues drawn from the climate mitigation component of the fiscal reform varies strongly 
with the context, and may not be sufficient to address the other 
objectives pursued. Even if the carbon price is high, the revenue 
it generates may be moderate as a share of GDP and eventually it 
will be zero if emissions are eliminated. For example, Jakob et al. 
(2016) find that the carbon pricing revenues that most countries 
in Sub-Saharan Africa could expect to generate only would meet 
a  small part of their infrastructure spending needs. In Sweden, 
the country with the highest carbon tax rate in the world, the tax 
has not been a  significant part of total tax revenues. Moreover, 
emissions from sectors covered by the tax have shrunk and, 
as a  result, the revenues from the tax, as a  share of GDP , have 
also declined, from a peak of 0.93% in 2004, when the rate was 
USD109 per metric tonne of CO2, to 0.48% in 2018, when the rate 
had reached USD132 (Jonsson et al. 2020; Statistics Sweden 2020). 
This means that governments that want to avoid a decline in the 
GDP share for total tax revenues over time would have to raise 
the intake from other taxes. However, it is here important to note 
that domestic tax hikes are likely to involve trade-offs since, at the 
same time as the spending they fund may provide various benefits, 
they may also reduce the capacity of households and the private 
sector to consume and invest, something that may reduce growth 
over time and reduced resources for spending in support of human 
development (Lofgren et al. 2013). It is also worth emphasising that 
restructuring of the fiscal system amount to changes in the social 
contract of the society (Combet and Hourcade 2017 and 2014), and 
thus represents a major economic and social decision.
4.4.1.9 Example: Combining Housing Policies With Carbon 
Taxation Can Deliver Both Housing and Mitigation 
in the Transport Sector
The spatial distribution of households and firms across urban and rural 
areas is a central characteristic of development pathways. Patterns of 
urbanisation, territorial development, and regional integration have 
wide-ranging implications for economic, social and environmental 
objectives (World Bank 2009). Notably, choices regarding spatial 
forms of development have large-scale implications for demand for 
transportation and associated GHG emissions.
Exclusionary mechanisms such as decreasing accessibility and 
affordability of inner-urban neighbourhoods is a  major cause 
of suburbanisation of low- to middle-income households 
(e.g., Hochstenbach and Musterd 2018). Suburbanisation, in turn, is 
associated with higher transportation demand (Bento et al. 2005) 
and higher carbon footprints for households (Jones and Kammen 
2014). Similarly, other studies find a significant positive link between 
housing prices and energy demand (Lampin et al. 2013).
Reducing emissions from transport in cities through traditional climate 
policy instruments (e.g., through a carbon tax) is more difficult when 
inner-urban neighbourhoods are less accessible and less affordable, 
because exclusionary mechanisms act as a  countervailing force to 
the rising transportation costs induced by the climate policy, pushing 
households outwards rather than inwards. Said differently, the costs 
of mitigating intra-city transportation emissions are higher when 
inner-urban housing prices are higher (Lampin et al. 2013).
This suggests that policies making inner-urban neighbourhoods more 
accessible and more affordable can open up broader opportunities 
for suburban households to relocate in the face of increasing 
transportation costs. This is particularly important for low- and 
middle-income households, who spend a  greater portion of their 
income on housing and transportation, and are more likely to be 
locked into locations that are distant from their jobs. Making inner-
urban neighbourhoods more accessible and more affordable has the 
potential to reduce both the social costs (e.g.,  households feeling 
helpless in front of rising fuel prices) and the economic costs of 
mitigation policies – as a lower price of carbon is likely to achieve 
the same amount of emission reductions since households have more 
capacities to adjust.
Making inner-cities neighbourhoods more accessible and more 
affordable is a complex endeavour (Benner and Karner 2016). At the 
same time, it is already a policy objective in its own right in many 
countries, independent of the climate mitigation motivation, for 
a  range of social, health and economic reasons. Revenues derived 
from climate policies could provide additional resources to support 
such programs, as some climate policy already have provisions to use 
their revenues towards low-income groups (Karner and Marcantonio 
2018). The mitigation benefits of keeping inner-cities more accessible 
and affordable for low- and middle-income households often remains 
out of, or is only emerging in the debates surrounding the planning 
of fast-developing cities in many developing countries (IADB 2012; 
Grant 2015; Khosla and Bhardwaj 2019). Finally, from a  political 
economy perspective, it is also interesting to note that (Bergquist et 
al. 2020) find higher support for climate policy packages in the USA 
when affordable housing programs are included.
In addition, investment in infrastructure is critical to the development 
of decarbonised economic structures that generate growth, 
employment, and universal access to a wide range of services that 
are central to the SDG agenda: transportation, water, sanitation, 
electricity, flood protection, and irrigation. For low- and middle-
income countries, annual costs of reaching these goals by 2030 and 
putting their economies on a path toward decarbonisation may range 
between 2% and 8% of GDP , with the level depending on spending 
efficiency. Notably, these costs need not exceed those of more 
polluting alternatives (Rozenberg and Fay 2019). For transportation, 
this involves a shift toward more public transportation (rail and bus), 
and decarbonised electricity for vehicles, combined with land-use 
policies that densify cities and reduce distances between homes and 
jobs. By influencing the spatial distribution of households and firms 
and the organisation of transportation, infrastructure has a strong 
bearing on GHG emissions and the costs of providing services to 
different populations. Depending on country context, the private 
sector may play a  particularly important role in the financing of 
infrastructure (World Bank 2009; Klein 2015).
Many investments in infrastructure and sectoral capital stocks have 
long lifetimes. Given this, it may be important to make sure that 
today’s investments be fully decarbonised at the start or that they 
later can be converted to zero carbon. Today’s investments in electric 
vehicles in settings where electricity is produced with fossil fuels is an example of convertible investments – they will be decarbonised 
once electricity production has switched to renewable energies. For 
capital stocks that cannot be decarbonised, countries may face costs 
of decommissioning well before the end of their useful lifetimes, 
especially when it is needed to respect country commitments to 
future full decarbonisation.
4.4.1.10 Example: Changing Economic, Social and Spatial 
Patterns of Development of the Agriculture Sector 
Provide the Basis for Sustained Reductions in 
Emissions From Deforestation
A growing literature assesses co-benefits of sectoral policies that 
lead to decarbonisation and simultaneously promote economic 
development, improve living standards, reduce inequality, and create 
job opportunities (Maroun and Schaeffer 2012; Bataille et al. 2016b; 
Pye et al. 2016; Bataille et al. 2018; La Rovere et al. 2018; Richter 
et al. 2018; Waisman et al. 2019). While this may be particularly 
challenging in developing countries, given large populations still 
lacking basic needs, previous development paths show that finding 
synergies in development and climate objectives in the AFOLU 
sector is possible. One example is Brazil, which has arguably shifted 
its development pathway to reduce emissions and make progress 
towards several SDGs, though progress is not linear. Over the past 
two decades, Brazil had made remarkable progress in implementing 
a sequence of policies across multiple sectors. This policy package 
simultaneously increased minimum wages of low income families, 
achieved universal energy access, and raised the quality of life and 
well-being for the large majority of the population (Da Silveira 
Bezerra et al. 2017; Grottera et al. 2017, 2018; La Rovere et al. 2018). 
This led to significant social benefits, reduction of income inequality 
and poverty eradication (Da Silveira Bezerra et al. 2017; Grottera 
et al. 2017), reflected in a decrease of the Gini coefficient and a rise 
in the human development index (La Rovere 2017).
Regulatory instruments were used to limit deforestation rates, 
together with implemented economic instruments that provided 
benefits to those protecting local ecosystems and enhancing land-
based carbon sinks (Nunes et al. 2017; Bustamante et al. 2018; 
Soterroni et al. 2018, 2019). In parallel, public policies reinforced 
environmental regulation and command-and-control instruments 
to limit deforestation rates and implemented market-based 
mechanisms to provide benefits to those protecting local ecosystems 
and enhancing land-based carbon sinks (Sunderlin et al. 2014; 
Nunes et al. 2017; Hein et al. 2018; Simonet et al. 2019). The private 
sector, aligned with public policies and civil society, implemented the 
Amazon Soy Moratorium, a voluntary agreement that bans trading of 
soybeans from cropland associated with cleared Amazon rainforest 
and blacklists farmers using slave labour. This was achieved without 
undermining production of soybean commodities (Soterroni et al. 
2019). As a result, between 2005 and 2012, the country halved its 
GHG emissions and reduced the rate of deforestation by 78% (INPE 
2019a,b). This example shows that development delivering well-
being can be accompanied by significant mitigation. A  long-term 
and strategic vision was important in guiding enabling policies 
and mechanisms.
In more recent years, some of these shifts in Brazil’s development 
pathways were undone. Political changes have redefined 
development priorities, with higher priority being given to 
agricultural development than climate change mitigation. The current 
administration has reduced the power of environmental agencies and 
forestry protection laws (including the forest code), while allowing 
the expansion of cropland to protected Amazon rainforest areas 
(Ferrante and Fearnside 2019; Rochedo et al. 2018). As a result, in 
2020, deforestation exceeded 11,000 km2, and reached the highest 
rate in the last 12 years (INPE 2020). The literature cautions that, 
if current policies and trends continue, the Amazon may reach an 
irreversible tipping point beyond which it will be impossible to 
remediate lost ecosystems and restore carbon sinks and indigenous 
people knowledge (Lovejoy and Nobre 2018; INPE 2019a; Nobre 
2019). In addition, fossil fuel subsidies and other fiscal support of 
increased exploitation of oil resources may create carbon lock-ins 
that further inhibit low-carbon investments (Lefèvre et al. 2018).
Brazil’s progress in mitigation depended significantly on reduced 
deforestation in the past. If deforestation rates keep on rising, 
mitigation efforts would need to shift to the energy sector. However, 
according to Rochedo et al. (2018), mitigation costs in the energy 
sector in Brazil are three times the costs of reducing deforestation 
and increasing land-based carbon sinks. Further mitigation strategies 
may depend on CCS in Brazil as elsewhere (Herreras Martínez 
et al. 2015; Nogueira de Oliveira et al. 2016), though the economic 
feasibility of deployment is not yet clear (Section 4.2.5.4).
4.4.2 Adaptation, Development Pathways  
and Mitigation
Mitigation actions are strongly linked to adaptation. These 
connections come about because mitigation actions can be adaptive 
(e.g.,  some agroforestry projects) but also through policy choices 
(e.g.,  climate finance is allocated among adaptation or mitigation 
projects) and even biophysical links (e.g.,  climate trajectories, 
themselves determined by mitigation, can influence the viability of 
adaptation projects). As development pathways shape the levers and 
enablers available to a society (Section 4.3.1, Figure 4.7), a broader 
set of enabling conditions also helps with adaptation (medium 
evidence, high agreement).
Previous assessments have consistently recognised this linkage. The 
Paris Agreement includes mitigation and adaptation as key areas of 
action, through NDCs and communicating adaptation actions and 
plans. The Agreement explicitly recognises that mitigation co-benefits 
resulting from adaptation can count towards NDC targets. The IPCC 
Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC 2014) emphasised that sustainable 
development is helpful in going beyond a narrow focus on separate 
mitigation and adaptation options and their specific co-benefits. 
The IPCC Special Report on climate change and land addresses 
GHG emissions from land-based ecosystems with a  focus on the 
vulnerability of land-based systems to climate change. The report 
identifies the potential of changes to land use and land management 
practices to mitigate and adapt to climate change, and to generate 
co-benefits that help meet other SDGs (Jian et al. 2019).A substantial literature detailing trade-offs and synergies between 
mitigation and adaptation exists and is summarised in the IPCC SR1.5 
including energy system transitions; land and ecosystem transitions 
(including addressing food system efficiency, sustainable agricultural 
intensification, ecosystem restoration); urban and infrastructure 
system transitions (including land use planning, transport systems, 
and improved infrastructure for delivering and using power); 
industrial system transitions (including energy efficiency, bio-based 
and circularity, electrification and hydrogen, and industrial carbon 
capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS); and carbon dioxide removal 
(including bioenergy with CCS, afforestation and reforestation, 
soil carbon sequestration, and enhanced weathering) (IPCC 2018: 
Table  4.SM.5.1). Careful design of policies to shift development 
pathways towards sustainability can increase synergies and manage 
trade-offs between mitigation and adaptation (robust evidence, 
medium agreement).
This section examines how development pathways can build greater 
adaptive and mitigative capacity, and then turns to several examples 
of mitigation actions with implications for adaptation where there 
is a notable link to development pathways and policy choices. These 
examples are in the areas of agriculture, blue carbon and terrestrial 
ecosystem restoration.
4.4.2.1 Development Pathways can Build Greater Capacity for 
Both Adaptation and Mitigation
Previous IPCC assessments have reflected on making development 
more sustainable (IPCC et al. 2001; Sathaye et al. 2007; Fleurbaey 
et al. 2014). Other assessments have highlighted how ecosystem 
functions can support sustainable development and are critical to 
meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement (IPBES 2019b). IPCC SR1.5 
found that sustainable development pathways to  1.5°C broadly 
support and often enable transformations and that ‘sustainable 
development has the potential to significantly reduce systemic 
vulnerability, enhance adaptive capacity, and promote livelihood 
security for poor and disadvantaged populations (high confidence)’ 
(IPCC 2018b: Section  5.3.1). With careful management, shifting 
development pathways can build greater adaptive and mitigative 
capacity, as further confirmed in recent literature (Schramski et al. 
2018; Harvey et al. 2014; Ebi et al. 2014; Rosenbloom et al. 2018; 
Antwi-Agyei et al. 2015; Singh 2018; IPBES 2019b). The literature 
points to the challenge of design of specific policies and shifts 
in development pathways to achieve both mitigation and 
adaptation goals.
Governance and institutional capacity
Governance and institutional capacity necessary for mitigation 
actions also enables effective adaptation actions. Implementation of 
mitigation and adaptation actions can, however, encounter different 
sets of challenges. Mitigation actions requiring a  shift away from 
established sectors and resources (e.g., fossil fuels) entail governance 
challenges to overcome vested interests (Piggot et al. 2020; SEI 
et al. 2020). Mitigation-focused initiatives from non-state actors 
tend to attain greater completion than adaptation-focused initiatives 
(NewClimate Institute et al. 2019).
Behaviour and lifestyles
On the level of individual entities, adaptation is reactive to current 
or anticipated environmental changes but mitigation is undertaken 
deliberately. Chapter  5  considers behavioural change, including 
the reconsideration of values and what is meant by well-being, 
and reflecting on a range of actors addressing both adaptation and 
mitigation. Shifting development pathways may be disruptive (Cross-
Chapter Box  5), and there may be limits to propensity to change. 
Some studies report that climate change deniers and sceptics can be 
induced to undertake pro-environmental action if those actions are 
framed in terms of societal welfare, not climate change (Bain et al. 
2012; Hornsey et al. 2016). Concrete initiatives to change behaviour 
and lifestyles include the Transition Town movement, which seeks 
to implement a just transition – both in relation to adaptation and 
mitigation – in specific localities (Roy et al. 2018).
Finance
Finance and investment of mitigation actions must be examined in 
conjunction with funding of adaptation actions, due to biophysical 
linkages and policy trade-offs (Box  15.1). Most climate funding 
supports mitigation efforts, not adaptation efforts (Buchner et al. 
2019) (Halimanjaya and Papyrakis 2012). Mitigation projects are 
often more attractive to private capital (Abadie et al. 2013; Buchner 
et al. 2019). Efforts to integrate adaptation and mitigation in climate 
change finance are limited (Kongsager et al. 2016; Locatelli et al. 2016) 
There is a perception that integration of mitigation and adaptation 
projects would lead to competition for limited finance available for 
adaptation (Locatelli et al. 2016). Long-standing debates (Ayers and 
Huq 2009; Smith et al. 2011) whether development finance counts 
as adaptation funding remain unresolved. See Chapter 15 for more 
in-depth discussion relating investment in funding mitigation and 
adaptation actions.
Innovation and technologies
Systems transitions that address both adaptation and mitigation 
include the widespread adoption of new and possibly disruptive 
technologies and practices and enhanced climate-driven innovation 
(IPCC 2018a). See Chapter  16 for an in-depth discussion of 
innovation and technology transfer. The literature points to trade-
offs that developing countries face in investing limited resources 
in research and development, though finding synergies in relation 
to agriculture (Adenle et al. 2015). Other studies point to difference 
in technology transfers for adaptation and mitigation (Biagini 
et al. 2014). Adaptation projects tend to use existing technologies 
whereas mitigation climate actions are more likely to rely on novel 
technologies. Innovations for mitigation are typically technology 
transfers from developed to less-developed countries (Biagini 
et al. 2014), however this so-called North-South technology transfer 
pathway is not exclusive (Biagini et al. 2014), and is increasingly 
challenged by China’s global role in implementing mitigation actions 
(Chen 2018; Urban 2018). Indigenous knowledge can be a unique 
source for techniques for adaptation (Nyong et al. 2007) and may be 
favoured over externally generated knowledge (Tume et al. 2019).Policy
Adaptation-focused pathways might reduce inequality, if adequate 
support is available and well-distributed (Pelling and Garschagen 
2019). Some studies suggest that cities might plan for possible 
synergies in adaptation and mitigation strategies, currently done 
independently (Grafakos et al. 2019). The literature suggests that 
cities might identify both mitigation and adaptation as co-benefits of 
interventions targeted at developmental goals (Dulal 2017).
4.4.2.2 Specific Links Between Mitigation and Adaptation
Mitigation actions can be adaptive and vice-versa. In particular, 
many nature-based solutions (NBS) for climate mitigation 
are  adaptive (medium evidence,  medium agreement). Multiple 
NBS are being pursued under current development pathways 
(Chapter  7), but shifting to sustainable development pathways 
may enable a wider set of nature-based mitigation solutions with 
adaptation benefits. An example of this would be a shift to more 
sustainable diets through guidelines, carbon taxes, or investment 
in  R&D of animal product substitutes (Figure  13.2) which could 
reduce pressure on land and allow for implementation of multiple 
NBS. Many of these solutions are consistent with meeting other 
societal goals, including biodiversity conservation and other 
sustainable development goals (Griscom et al. 2017; Fargione 
et al. 2018; Tallis et al. 2018). However, there can be synergies 
and trade-offs in meeting a  complex set of sustainability goals 
(e.g., biodiversity, Section 7.6.5 and 3.1.5).
Development is a  key factor leading to land degradation in many 
parts of the world (IPBES 2019b). Shifting development pathways to 
sustainability can include restoration and protection of ecosystems, 
which can enhance capacity for both mitigation and adaptation 
actions (IPBES 2019b).
In this section, we explore mitigation actions related to sustainable 
agriculture, coastal ecosystems (‘blue carbon’), and restoration and 
protection of some terrestrial ecosystems. These mitigation actions 
are exemplary of trade-offs and synergies with adaptation, sensitivity 
to biophysical coupling, and linkages to development pathways. 
Other specific examples can be found in Chapters 6 to 11.
Farming system approaches can benefit mitigation and adaptation
Farming system approaches can be a  significant contributor to 
mitigation pathways. These practices (which are not mutually 
exclusive) include agroecology, conservation agriculture, 
integrated production systems and organic farming (Box  7.5). 
Such methods have potential to sequester significant amounts of 
soil carbon (Section 7.4.3.1) as well as reduce emissions from on-
field practices such as rice cultivation, fertilizer management, and 
manure management (Section 7.4.3) with total mitigation potential 
of 3.9 ± 0.2 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 (Chapter 7). Critically, these approaches 
may have significant benefits in terms of adaptation and other 
development goals.
Farming system approaches to agricultural mitigation have a wide 
variety of co-benefits and trade-offs. Indeed, there are conceptual 
formulations for these practices in which the co-benefits are more of 
a focus, such as climate-smart agriculture (CSA) which ties mitigation 
to adaptation through its three pillars of increased productivity, 
mitigation, and adaptation (Lipper et al. 2014). The ‘4 per 1000’ goal 
to increase soil carbon by 0.4% per year (Soussana et al. 2019) is 
compatible with the three pillars of CSA. Sustainable intensification, 
a framework which centers around a need for increased agricultural 
production within environmental constraints also complements CSA 
(Campbell et al. 2014). The literature reports examples of mitigation 
co-benefits of adaptation actions, with evidence from various regions 
(Thornton and Herrero 2015; Thornton et al. 2018) (Chapter 7).
Conservation agriculture, promoted for improving agricultural soils 
and crop diversity (Powlson et al. 2016) can help build adaptive 
capacity (Smith et al. 2017; Pradhan et al. 2018a) and yield 
mitigation co-benefits through improved fertiliser use or efficient use 
of machinery and fossil fuels (Harvey et al. 2014; Cui et al. 2018; 
Pradhan et al. 2018a).
There is a  complex set of barriers to implementation of farming-
system approaches for climate mitigation (Section 7.6.4), suggesting 
a  need for deliberate shifts in development pathways to achieve 
significant progress in this sector. The link between NDCs and 
mitigation in the land use sector can provide impetus for such policies. 
For example, there are multiple agricultural mitigation options that 
southeast Asian countries could use to meet NDCs that would have 
an important adaptive impact (Amjath-Babu et al. 2019).
Some agricultural practices considered sustainable have trade-offs, 
and their implementation can have negative effects on adaptation or 
other ecosystem services. Fast-growing tree monocultures or biofuel 
crops may enhance carbon stocks but reduce downstream water 
availability and decrease availability of agricultural land (Windham-
Myers et al. 2018; Kuwae and Hori 2019). In some dry environments 
similarly, agroforestry can increase competition with crops and 
pastures, decreasing productivity, and reduce catchment water yield 
(Schrobback et al. 2011).
Agricultural practices can adapt to climate change while decreasing 
CO2 emissions on the farm field. However, if such a practice leads 
to lower yields, interconnections of the global agricultural system 
can lead to land use change elsewhere and a  net increase in 
GHG emissions (Erb et al. 2016). Implementation of sustainable 
agriculture can increase or decrease yields depending on context 
(Pretty et al. 2006).
Blue carbon and mitigation co-benefits of adaptation actions
The Paris Agreement recognises that mitigation co-benefits resulting 
from Parties’ adaptation actions and/or economic diversification 
plans can contribute to mitigation outcomes (UNFCCC 2015a: 
Article 4.7). Blue carbon refers to biologically-driven carbon flux or 
storage in coastal ecosystems such as seagrasses, salt marshes, and 
mangroves (Wylie et al. 2016; Fennessy et al. 2019; Fourqurean et al. 2012; Tokoro et al. 2014) (see Cross-Chapter Box 8 on blue carbon as 
a storage medium and removal process).
Restoring or protecting coastal ecosystems is a  mitigation action 
with synergies with adaptation and development. Such restoration 
has been described as a ‘no regrets’ mitigation option in the Special 
Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (Bindoff 
et al. 2019) and advocated as a climate solution at national scales 
(Bindoff et al. 2019; Taillardat et al. 2018; Fargione et al. 2018) and 
global scales (Howard et al. 2017). On a  per-area basis, carbon 
stocks in coastal ecosystems can be higher than in terrestrial forests 
(Howard et al. 2017), with below-ground carbon storage up to 1000 
tC ha–1 (McLeod et al. 2011; Crooks et al. 2018; Bindoff et al. 2019). 
Overall, coastal vegetated systems have a  mitigation potential of 
around 0.5% of current global emissions, with an upper limit of less 
than 2% (Bindoff et al. 2019).
Restoration or protection of coastal ecosystems is an important 
adaptation action with multiple benefits, with bounded global 
mitigation benefits (Gattuso et al. 2018; Bindoff et al. 2019). Such 
restoration/preservation reduces coastal erosion and protects from 
storm surges, and otherwise mitigates impacts of sea level rise and 
extreme weather along the coast line (Siikamäki et al. 2012; Romañach 
et al. 2018; Alongi 2008). Restoration of tidal flow to coastal wetlands 
inhibits methane emissions which occur in fresh and brackish water 
(Kroeger et al. 2017) (Section 7.4.2.8 describes a more inclusive set 
of ecosystem services provided by coastal wetlands). Coastal habitat 
restoration projects can also provide significant social benefits in the 
form of job creation (through tourism and recreation opportunities), 
as well as ecological benefits through habitat preservation (Edwards 
et al. 2013; Sutton-Grier et al. 2015; Sutton-Grier and Moore 2016; 
Wylie et al. 2016; Kairo et al. 2018; Bindoff et al. 2019).
Coastal ecosystem-based mitigation can be cost-effective, but 
interventions should be designed with care. One concern is to 
assure that actions remain effective at higher levels of climate 
change (Alongi 2015; Bindoff et al. 2019). Also, methane emissions 
from ecosystems may partially reduce the benefit of the carbon 
sequestration (Rosentreter et al. 2018) depending on the salinity 
(Poffenbarger et al. 2011; Kroeger et al. 2017). As the main driver 
of mangrove forest loss is aquaculture/agriculture (Thomas et al. 
2017), there may be entrenched interests opposing restoration and 
protection actions.
Restoration and protection of terrestrial ecosystems
Restoration of terrestrial landscapes can be a  direct outcome of 
development pathways, and can be critical to achieving a variety of 
SDGs (especially 1, 2, 6, 8, 13, 15)  (Vergara et al. 2016; Lapola et al. 
2018) although it also presents risks and can have trade-offs with 
other SDGs (Cao et al. 2010; Dooley and Kartha 2018). Landscape 
restoration is nearly always a mitigation action, and can also provide 
adaptive capacity. While policy in Brazil has tended to focus on the 
Amazon as a carbon sink, the mitigation co-benefits of ecosystem-
based adaptation actions have been highlighted in the literature 
(Locatelli et al. 2011; Di Gregorio et al. 2016). A study of potential 
restoration of degraded lands in Latin America (Vergara et al. 2016) 
indicates that substantial benefits for mitigation, adaptation, and 
economic development accrue after several years, underscoring 
a reliance on deliberate development choices. In agricultural contexts, 
restoration is a development choice that can enhance adaptive and 
mitigative capacity via impact on farmer livelihoods.
Preventing degradation of landscapes can support both mitigation 
and adaptation (IPCC 2019). Restoration of ecosystems is associated 
with improved water filtration, groundwater recharge and flood 
control and multiple other ecosystem services (Ouyang et al. 2016).
Restoration projects must be designed with care. There can be trade-
offs in addition to the synergies noted above (Section  7.6.4.3). 
Restorations may be unsuccessful if not considered in their socio-
economic context (Lengefeld et al. 2020; Iftekhar et al. 2017; Jellinek 
et al. 2019). Restoration projects for mitigation purposes can be 
more effective if done with adaptation in mind (Gray et al. 2011) as 
a changing climate may render some mitigation actions biophysically 
infeasible (Arneth et al. 2021). Landscape restoration projects 
intended for CDR may underperform due to future release of stored 
carbon, or deferral of storage until after irreversible climate change 
effects (e.g. extinctions) (Dooley and Kartha 2018).
Afforestation plans have received substantial attention as a climate 
mitigation action, with ongoing unresolved debate on the feasibility 
and trade-offs of such plans. Such afforestation programs can fail 
for biophysical reasons (Fleischman et al. 2020) (Section  7.4.2.2) 
but also lack of consideration of socioeconomic and development 
contexts (Fleischman et al. 2020).
4.4.3 Risks and Uncertainties
Shifting development pathways and accelerating mitigation are 
complex endeavours that carry risks. Some of these risks can be easily 
captured by quantitative models. Others are better understood via 
qualitative approaches, such as qualitative narrative storylines (told 
in words) and methods mixing qualitative and quantitative models 
(Kemp-Benedict 2012; Hanger-Kopp et al. 2019). The following 
outline key risks and relevant hedging strategies identified in 
the literature.
4.4.3.1 Actions by Others Not Consistent 
With Domestic efforts
The international context is a major source of uncertainty for national-
level planning, especially for small- or medium-sized open economies, 
because the outcome of domestic choices may significantly depend 
on decisions made by other countries and actor, over which national 
governments have limited or no control (Lachapelle and Paterson 
2013). Availability of foreign financial resources in countries with 
limited domestic savings (Baum et al. 2017) and availability of 
technology transfers (Glachant and Dechezleprêtre 2017) are some 
examples. Other external decisions with significant bearing on 
domestic action include mitigation policies in other countries (Dai et al. 2017), and especially in major trading partners, the lack of 
which can result in competitive disadvantage for sectors exposed to 
international competition (Alton et al. 2014). The international prices 
of the key commodities (notably energy), goods and services are 
important, notably when shifting development pathway is based on 
structural change (e.g.,  Willenbockel et al. 2017 for Ghana and Kenya).
Remedies include first devising policy packages that are, to the 
extent possible, robust to uncertainty regarding external decisions. 
For example, mitigation in the building sector is considered less 
problematic for competitiveness since the construction sector is 
less exposed to international competition. Remedies also include 
securing international cooperation to reduce the uncertainty 
that domestic decision-makers face about the international 
context. Shifting investments towards low-GHG solutions requires 
a  combination of conducive public policies, attractive investment 
opportunities and financing of transitions (Section 15.6), which can 
enable shifting development pathways. Cooperation can generate 
positive spill overs through technology diffusion (Section  13.6.6). 
Third, cooperation is not limited to governments. As discussed in 
Section 4.2.3, international cooperative initiatives among non-state 
actors (cities, economic branches, etc.) can also provide know-how, 
resources and stable cooperative frameworks that reduce uncertainty 
for individual actors (Section 14.5.5).
4.4.3.2 Parts of Complex Policy Packages Fail
As outlined in the examples in Section  4.4.1 above, shifting 
development pathways and accelerating mitigation are complex 
endeavours, on which there is limited experience and know-how 
from the past. An uncertainty is that parts of these policy packages 
may fail, in other words, under-deliver relative to the amount of 
mitigation and of transformations initially expected. For example, 
France has failed to meet its 2015–2018 carbon budget as housing 
retrofitting programs, in particular, have failed to deliver the expected 
amount of emission reductions (Haut Conseil pour le Climat 2019). 
There are two main options to tackle this risk. The first is to build 
in redundancy. The second is to anticipate that some parts of the 
policies will inevitably fail, and build-in monitoring and corrective 
mechanisms in a sequential decision-making process. To this regard, 
building institutions that can properly monitor, learn from and 
improve over time is critical (Nair and Howlett 2017).
4.4.3.3 New Information Becomes Available
The science on climate change, its impacts and the opportunities to 
mitigate is continuously being updated. Even though decisions are no 
longer made ‘in a sea of uncertainty’ (Lave 1991), we know that new 
information will come over time, that may have significant bearing on 
the design and objectives of policies to shift development pathways 
and accelerate mitigation. New information may come from climate 
sciences (e.g.,  updated GWP values or available carbon budgets) 
(Quéré et al. 2018), impact sciences (e.g.,  re-evaluation of climate 
impacts associated with given emission pathways) (Ricke et al. 2018) 
or mitigation sciences (e.g.,  on availability of given technologies) 
(Lenzi et al. 2018; Giannousakis et al. 2020).
At the same time, economic and social systems are characterised by 
high degree of inertia, via long-lived capital stock or urban forms 
(Lecocq and Shalizi 2014), or more broadly mutually reinforcing 
physical, economic, and social constraints (Seto et al. 2016) that 
may lead to carbon lock-ins (Erickson et al. 2015). Risks associated 
with long-lasting fossil-fuel power plants have been the object of 
particular attention. For example, Pfeiffer et al. (2018) estimate 
that even if the current pipeline of power plants was cancelled, 
about 20% of the existing capacity might be stranded to remain 
compatible with 1.5°C or 2°C pathways – implying that additional 
capital accumulation would lead to higher sunk costs associated with 
stranded assets (Ansar et al. 2013; Johnson et al. 2015; Kriegler et al. 
2018; Luderer et al. 2018b).
In the presence of uncertainty and inertia (or irreversibilities), 
hedging strategies may be considered, that include selection of 
risk-hedging strategies and processes to adjust decisions as new 
information becomes available. The notion of hedging against risks 
is also prominent in the adaptation literature, as exemplified by 
the terminology of ‘climate resilient development’ (Fankhauser and 
McDermott 2016) (AR6 WGII, Chapter18). There is also a  growing 
literature on hedging strategies for individual actors (e.g.,  firms 
or investors) in the face of the uncertainties associated with 
mitigation (e.g.,  policy uncertainty or the associated carbon price 
uncertainty; e.g., Andersson et al. 2016 or Morris et al. 2018). On the 
other hand, there is often limited discussion of uncertainty and of 
its implication for hedging strategies in the accelerated mitigation 
pathway literature. Exceptions include (Capros et al. 2019), who elicit 
‘no-regret’ and ‘disruptive’ mitigation options for the EU through 
a detailed sensitivity analysis, and (Watson et al. 2015) who discuss 
flexible strategies for the UK energy sector transition in the face of 
multiple uncertainties.
4.4.3.4 Black Swans (Such as the COVID-19 Crisis)
As the current COVID-19 crisis demonstrates, events happen that 
can derail the best-laid plans. Unexpected events beyond the range 
of human experience until then are called ‘black swans’, given the 
expectation that all swans are white. The only point to note here is 
that such events may also provide opportunities. In the COVID-19 
case, for example, the experience of conducting many activities on-
line, which reduces emissions from transport, may leave an imprint 
on how some of these activities are carried out in the post-COVID-19 
world. Similarly, reduced air pollution seen during the pandemics may 
increase support for mitigation and strengthen the case for climate 
action. However, the emissions implications of recovery packages 
depend on choosing policies that support climate action while 
addressing the socio-economic implications of COVID-19 (Hepburn 
et al. 2020). Governments may be in a  stronger position to do so 
due to their pivotal role in assuring the survival of many businesses 
during the pandemics. Given the magnitude of recovery packages 
and their implications (Pollitt et al. 2021), choosing the direction of 
recovery packages amounts to choosing a  development pathway 
(Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1).4.4.3.5 Transformations Run Into Oppositions
As noted above, shifting development pathways and accelerating 
mitigation involve a  broad range of stakeholders and decision-
makers, at multiple geographical and temporal scales. They 
require a  credible and trusted process for reconciling perspectives 
and balancing potential side-effects, managing winners and losers 
and implementing compensatory measures to ensure an inclusive 
just transition (Newell and Mulvaney 2013; Miller and Richter 2014; 
Gambhir et al. 2018; Diffenbaugh and Burke 2019). Such processes 
are designed to manage the risk of inequitable or non-representative 
power dynamics (Helsinki Design Lab 2011; Boulle et al. 2015; 
Kahane 2012). More generally, stakeholder processes can be subject 
to regulatory capture by special interests, or outright opposition 
from a  variety of stakeholders. Information asymmetry between 
government and business may shape the results of consultative 
processes. Long experience of political management of change 
demonstrates that managing such risks is not easy, and requires 
sufficiently strong and competent institutions (Stiglitz 1998). The 
next section on Just Transition (Section 4.5) addresses this issue.
4.5 Equity, Including Just Transitions
Equity is an ethical and at times economic imperative, but it is 
also instrumentally an enabler of deeper ambition for accelerated 
mitigation (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2019). The literature supports 
a range of estimates of the net benefits – globally or nationally – of 
low-carbon transformation, and it identifies a number of difficulties 
in drawing definitive quantitative conclusions (e.g.,  comparisons 
of costs and benefits among different actors, the existence of non-
economic impacts, comparison across time, uncertainty in magnitude) 
(Section 3.6). One of the most important of these dimensions is the 
distributional consequences of mitigation, as well as a range of equity 
considerations arising from the uncertainty in net benefits, as well 
as from the distribution of costs and benefits among winners and 
losers (Rendall 2019; Caney 2016; Lahn and Bradley 2016; Lenferna 
2018a; Kartha et al. 2018b; Robiou Du Pont et al. 2017). Some equity 
approaches are even just seeking corrective justice including for 
historical emissions (Adler 2007). For an assessment of literature on 
fairness in NDCs, see Section 4.2.2.7.
Equity issues are often discussed in the literature via frameworks that 
are well-founded in the ethical literature and that have a  strong bearing 
on effort-sharing, but have not yet been quantitatively modelled 
and expressed in the form of an emissions allocation  quantified 
framework. These include, for example, ethical perspectives based 
in human rights (Johl and Duyck 2012), human capabilities (Klinsky 
et al. 2017b), environmental justice (Mohai et al. 2009; Schlosberg 
2009), ecological debt (Srinivasana et al. 2008; Warlenius et al. 2015), 
transitional justice (Klinsky 2017; Klinsky and Brankovic 2018), and 
planetary boundaries (Häyhä et al. 2016).
While there is extensive literature on equity frameworks for national 
emissions allocations (CSO Equity Review 2015, 2017, 2018; Holz et al. 
2018; Kemp-Benedict et al. 2018; Robiou du Pont and Meinshausen 
2018; Fyson et al. 2020; Pozo et al. 2020; Pye et al. 2020), such 
studies have tended to focus on allocation of a global carbon budget 
among countries based on quantified equity frameworks. The implicit 
normative choices made in these analysis have limitations (Kartha 
et al. 2018a). Moreover, there are many ethical parameters that could 
be introduced to enrich the existing quantitative frameworks, such 
as progressivity (Holz et al. 2018), consumption-based accounting 
(Afionis et al. 2017), prioritarianism (Adler and Treich 2015), and a right 
to development (Moellendorf 2020). Introducing these ethical frames 
into conventional quantification approaches generally implies greater 
allocations for poorer and lower-emitting populations, suggesting that 
the approaches that are typically highlighted in emissions allocation 
analyses tends to favour wealthier and higher-emitting countries. 
Broader, more inclusive sharing of costs and burdens is seen as a way 
to enhance equity in procedures and outcomes.
Ultimately, equity consequences depend on how costs and benefits 
are initially incurred and how they are shared as per social contracts 
(Combet and Hourcade 2017), national policy, and international 
agreements. The literature suggests a  relationship between the 
effectiveness of cooperative action and the perception of fairness of 
such arrangements. Winkler et al. (2018) demonstrate that countries 
have put forward a  wide variety of indicators and approaches for 
explaining the fairness and ambition of their NDCs, reflecting the 
broader range of perspectives found in the moral philosophical 
literature cited above. Mbeva and Pauw (2016) further find that 
adaptation and financing issues take on greater salience in the 
national perspectives reflected in the NDCs.
Topics of equity and fairness have begun to receive a greater amount 
of attention within the energy and climate literature, namely through 
the approaches of gender and race (Pearson et al. 2017; Lennon 2017; 
Allen et al. 2019), climate justice (Roberts and Parks 2007; Routledge 
et al. 2018) (Roberts &  Parks, 2006; Routledge et al. 2018), and 
energy justice (Sovacool and Dworkin 2014). While such approaches 
frequently envision justice and equity as an ethical imperative, justice 
also possesses the instrumental value of enabling deeper and more 
socially acceptable mitigation efforts (Klinsky and Winkler 2018).
A concrete focal point on these issues has been that of ‘just transition’. 
Getting broad consensus for the transformational changes entailed 
in moving from a  high- to a  low-carbon economy means ‘leaving 
no one behind’, in other words, ensuring (sufficiently) equitable 
transition for the relevant affected individuals, workers, communities, 
sectors, regions and countries (Newell and Mulvaney, 2013; Jasanoff 
2018). The concept of a ‘just transition’ owes its origin to the USA 
trade union movement of the 1980s. The earliest version of a just 
transition was called the ‘Superfund for Workers’ modelled on the 

up of toxic substances from chemicals, mining and energy production 
(Stevis and Felli 2015). It was further taken up, for example in the 
collaboration of the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), 
the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the UN Environment 
Programme (UNEP) in promoting ‘green jobs’ as integral elements of a  just transition (ILO 2015; Rosemberg 2010). In recent years 
the concept of a ‘just transition’ has gained increased traction, for 
example incorporated in the outcome of the Rio+20 Earth Summit 
and more recently recognised in the preamble of the Paris Agreement, 
which states ‘the imperative of a just transition of the workforce and 
the creation of decent work and quality jobs in accordance with 
nationally defined development priorities’ (UNFCCC 2015a). Some 
heads of state and government signed a Solidarity and Just Transition 
Silesia Declaration first introduced at COP24 in Poland (HoSG 2018).
The literature identifies targeted and proactive measures from 
governments, agencies, and authorities to ensure that any negative 
social, environmental or economic impacts of economy-wide transitions 
are minimised, while benefits are maximised for those disproportionally 
affected (Healy and Barry 2017). While the precise definition varies by 
source, core elements tend to include: (i) investments in establishing 
low-emission and labour-intensive technologies and sectors (Mijn 
Cha et al. 2020); (ii) research and early assessment of the social and 
employment impacts of climate policies (Green and Gambhir 2020; 
Mogomotsi et al. 2018); (iii) social dialogue and democratic consultation 
of social partners and stakeholders (Swilling and Annecke 2012; Smith 
2017); (iv) the creation of decent jobs; active labour markets policies; 
and rights at work (ILO 2015; UNFCCC 2016c); (v) fairness in energy 
access and use (Carley and Konisky 2020); (vi) economic diversification 
based on low-carbon investments; (vii) realistic training/retraining 
programs that lead to decent work; (viii) gender specific politics 
that promote equitable outcomes (Allwood 2020); (ix) the  fostering 
of international cooperation and coordinated multilateral actions 
(Lenferna 2018b; Newell and Simms 2020); (x) redressing of past 
harms and perceived injustices (Setzer and Vanhala 2019; UNHRC 
2020); and (xi) consideration of inter-generational justice concerns, 
such as the impacts of policy decisions on future generations (Newell 
and Mulvaney, 2013).
A just transition could therefore entail that the state intervenes more 
actively in the eradication of poverty, and creates jobs in lower-
carbon sectors, in part to compensate for soon-to-be abandoned 
fossil-fuel-based sectors, and that governments, polluting industries, 
corporations and those more able to pay higher associated taxes 
pay for transition costs, provide a welfare safety net and adequate 
compensation for people, communities, places, and regions that 
have been impacted by pollution, marginalised or negatively 
impacted by a transition from a high- to low-carbon economy and 
society (Muttitt and Kartha 2020; Le Billon and Kristoffersen 2020; 
Kartha et al. 2018b). Reducing climate impacts is another important 
dimension of equity, in that the poor who are least responsible 
for climate change are most vulnerable to its impacts (AR6 WGII, 
Chapter 8). Focusing on financial losses alone however can obscure 
an important distinction between losses incurred by corporations 
and states and losses experienced by workers and communities. 
Processes established in the name of a  just transition are also at 
risk of being co-opted by incumbent interests and powerful/wealthy 
agents (Green and Gambhir, 2020). Policy interventions associated 
with good governance, democratic oversight, and legal recourse can 
help overcome attempted co-optation of just transition, or use of 
COVID-19 recovery packages for continued carbon lock-in (Hepburn 
et al. 2020; SEI et al. 2020).
The just transition concept has thus become an international focal 
point tying together social movements, trade unions, and other key 
stakeholders to ensure equity is better accounted for in low-carbon 
transitions and to seek to protect workers and communities. It also 
forms a central pillar of the growing movement for a ‘Green New 
Deal’ – a roadmap for a broad spectrum of policies, programs, and 
legislation that aims to rapidly decarbonise the economy while 
significantly reducing economic inequality (Allam et al. 2021; Galvin 
and Healy 2020). The US Green New Deal Resolution (Ocasio-Cortez 
2019) for example, positions structural inequality, poverty mitigation, 
and a just transition at its centre. The European Green Deal proposed 
in 2019 (European Commission 2019), including a  €100  billion 
‘Just Transition Mechanism’ to mitigate the social effects of 
transitioning away from jobs in fossil-based industries. National 
level green new deals with strong just transition components have 
been proposed in South Korea, Australia, Spain, UK, Puerto Rico, 
Canada, as well as regional proposals across Latin America and the 
Caribbean (Pollin 2020).A just transition at national, regional and local scales can help to 
ensure that workers, communities, frontline communities and 
the energy-poor are not left behind in the transition. Moreover, 
a  just transition necessitates that rapid decarbonisation does not 
perpetuate asymmetries between richer and poorer states and 
people (UNHRC 2020). Alliances around a just transition in countries 
across the world take many forms (Box 4.6).
As Figure 4.9 shows, no fewer than seven national commissions or task 
forces on a just transition existed as of 2020 as well as seven other 
sets of national policies and a  multitude of other actors, networks, 
and movements. For instance, the German phase-out of coal subsidies 
involved a  savings package for unemployed miners. Subsidy reform 
packages introduced by Iran, Namibia, the Philippines, Turkey, and 
United Kingdom provide similar compensating measures to affected 
groups (Sovacool 2017). Spain’s just transition plan for coal miners 
includes early retirement, redundancy packages, silicosis compensation, 
retraining for green jobs, and priority job placement for former miners.Box 4.6 | Selected Organisations and Movements Supporting a Just Transition

This section summarises knowledge gaps that require further research:
• Literature on mitigation pathways at the national level remains 
skewed towards large emitters. Many low-income countries 
have very few or no studies at all (Lepault and Lecocq 2021) 
(Section  4.2) (Annex III). Development of new studies and 
inclusion of associated scenarios in updated mitigation national 
mitigation pathway database would enhance understanding of 
mitigation at national level.
• Ex ante and ex post analysis of mitigation action and of 
mitigation  plans by non-state actors, and their relationship 
with mitigation action and plans by governments is limited 
(Section 4.2.3).
• System analysis solutions are only beginning to be recognised in 
current literature on deep mitigation pathways, and rarely 
included in existing national policies or strategies (Section 4.2.5).
• While the technology elements of accelerated mitigation 
pathways at national level are generally well documented, 
studies of the economic and social implications of such pathways 
remain scarce (Section 4.2.6).
• Literature on the implication of development choices for 
emissions and for capacity to mitigate is limited (Section 4.3.2). 
In particular, more contributions from the research community 
working on development issues would be very useful here.
• Literature describing shifts in development pathways, and the 
conditions for such shifts (based on past experience or on models) 
remains scarce (Sections 4.3.1, 4.3.3 and 4.4.1). Studying shifts 
in development pathways requires new ways of thinking with 
interdisciplinary research and use of alternative frameworks 
and methods suited for understanding of change agents, 
determinants of change and adaptive management among other 
issues (Winkler 2018). Research is not only expected to produce 
knowledge and boost innovation, but also to help identify 
transformation pathways and to enlighten public debate and 
public decision-making on related political choices.
• Other research gaps concern the open ocean and blue carbon. 
There is limited knowledge about quantification of the blue 
carbon stocks. Research is required into what happens if the 
sequestration capacity of the ocean and marine ecosystems 
is damaged by climate change to the tipping point until the 
sink becomes an emitter, and on how to manage blue carbon 
(Section 4.4.2).
• Knowledge is limited on: (i) linking equity frameworks on 
mitigation with adaptation and most importantly with loss and 
damage, (ii) applying ethical parameters to enrich many of the 
existing quantitative frameworks, to assess fairness and ambition 
of NDCs; (iii) extending equity frameworks to quantify equitable 
international support, as the difference between equity-based 
national emissions scenarios and national domestic emissions 
scenarios (Sections 4.2.2.7 and 4.5).
FAQ 4.1 |  What is to be done over and above countries’ existing pledges under the Paris 
Agreement to keep global warming well below 2°C?
Current pledges and efforts under the PA aimed at keeping global warming below 2°C are not enough, falling short by 14 to 

are not fulfilled for those Parties that have made their pledges with conditions for support (Section 4.2.2.3). To cover up for these 
shortfalls will require taking actions across all sectors that can substantially reduce GHG emissions. Examples of such actions 
include shifting to low- or zero-emission power generation, such as renewables; changing food systems, such as diet changes away 
from land-intensive animal products; electrifying transport and developing ‘green infrastructure’, such as building green roofs, or 
improving energy efficiency by smart urban planning, which will change the layout of many cities. Because these different actions 
are connected, it means all relevant companies, industries and stakeholders would need to be involved to increase the support 
and chance of successful implementation (Section 4.2.5). The deployment of low-emission technology depends upon economic 
conditions (e.g., employment generation or capacity to mobilise investment), but also on social/cultural conditions (e.g., awareness 
and acceptability) and institutional conditions (e.g., political support and understanding), and the provision of relevant enabling 
conditions (Section  4.4.1). Encouraging stronger and more ambitious climate action by non-government and sub-national 
stakeholders, as well as international cooperative initiatives (ICIs) could make significant contributions to emissions reduction 
(Section 4.2.3).
FAQ 4.2 |  What is to be done in the near term to accelerate mitigation and shift 
development pathways?
Increasing speed of implementation, breadth of action across all sectors of the economy, and depth of emission reduction faces 
important obstacles, that are rooted in the underlying structure of societies (Section 4.2.7). Addressing these obstacles amounts to 
shifting away from existing developmental trends (i.e., shifting development pathways, Cross-Chapter Box 5). This can be done by 
strengthening governance and institutional capacity, aligning technology and innovation systems with low-carbon development, 
facilitating behaviour change and providing adequate finance within the context of multi-objective policy packages and sequences 
(Section  4.4.1). Shifting development pathways towards sustainability broadens the scope for, and is thus a  complement to, 
accelerated mitigation (Section 4.3).
FAQ 4.3 |  Is it possible to accelerate mitigation in the near term while there are so many other 
development priorities? (Education, health, employment, etc.)
It is possible to accelerate mitigation while addressing other developmental priorities by implementing measures that simultaneously 
address both climate and development goals. Casting mitigation in the broader context of development pathways provides additional 
opportunities to articulate both (Section 4.3.1.4). Policies such as progressive taxation, investment in public transport, regulatory 
transparency, commitment to multilateral environmental governance, fiscal incentives for private investments, international 
technology development and transfer initiatives, and risk disclosure and efforts to improve underlying enabling conditions (improving 
governance and institutional capacity, fostering behavioural change and technological innovation, and provision of finance) address 
multiple objectives beyond mitigation, such as job creation, macroeconomic stability, economic growth, public health and welfare, 
providing energy access, providing formal housing, and providing mobility. How we manage our land and agriculture, growing cities, 
transport needs, our industries, and the way people are trained and employed all impact on GHG emissions and the options we 
have to reduce them. In turn, reducing GHG emissions can also contribute to reducing poverty, preventing hunger, improving health 
and wellbeing, and providing clean water and clean energy. Implementing right policies and investments can help to address the 
challenges of how to reduce emissions without constraining development. For example, in land use, widespread planting of a single 
tree species or crops for bioenergy (organic matter turned into renewable energy) could affect food and water supplies. Therefore, if 
bioenergy is to be relied upon to offset emissions, the right policies and investments are needed (see also Chapter 17).

Assessment of the social science literature and regional case studies 
reveals how social norms, culture, and individual choices interact with 
infrastructure and other structural changes over time. This provides 
new insight into climate change mitigation strategies, and how 
economic and social activity might be organised across sectors to 
support emission reductions. To enhance well-being, people demand 
services and not primary energy and physical resources per  se. 
Focusing on demand for services and the different social and political 
roles people play broadens the participation in climate action.
Potential of Demand-side Actions and Service 
Provisioning Systems
Demand-side mitigation and new ways of providing services 
can help avoid, shift, and improve final service demand. Rapid 
and deep changes in demand make it easier for every sector 
to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the short and 
medium term (high confidence). {5.2, 5.3}
The indicative potential of demand-side strategies to reduce 
emissions of direct and indirect CO 2 and non-CO 2 GHG emissions 
in three end-use sectors (buildings, land transport, and food) is 
40–70% globally by 2050 (high confidence). Technical mitigation 
potentials compared to the 2050 emissions projection of two scenarios 
consistent with policies announced by national governments until 2020 
amount to 6.8 GtCO 2 for building use and construction, 4.6 GtCO 2 for 
land transport and 8.0 GtCO 2-eq for food demand,  and amount to 
4.4 GtCO 2 for industry. Mitigation strategies can be classified as Avoid-
Shift-Improve (ASI) options, that reflect opportunities for socio-cultural, 
infrastructural, and technological change. The greatest ‘Avoid’ potential 
comes from reducing long-haul aviation and providing short-distance 
low-carbon urban infrastructures. The greatest ‘Shift’ potential would 
come from switching to plant-based diets. The greatest ‘Improve’ 
potential comes from within the building sector, and in particular 
increased use of energy-efficient end-use technologies and passive 
housing. {5.3.1, 5.3.2, Figure  5.7, Figure  5.8, Table  5.1, Chapter  5 
Supplementary Material II, Table 5.SM.2}
Socio-cultural and lifestyle changes can accelerate climate change 
mitigation (medium confidence). Among 60 identified actions that 
could change individual consumption, individual mobility choices have 
the largest potential to reduce carbon footprints. Prioritising car-free 
mobility by walking and cycling and adoption of electric mobility could 
save 2 tCO 2-eq cap–1 yr –1. Other options with high mitigation potential 
include reducing air travel, heating and cooling set-point adjustments, 
reduced appliance use, shifts to public transit, and shifting consumption 
towards plant-based diets. {5.3.1, 5.3.1.2, Figure 5.8}
Leveraging improvements in end-use service delivery through 
behavioural and technological innovations, and innovations 
in market organisation, leads to large reductions in upstream 
resource use (high confidence). Analysis of indicative potentials 
range from a factor 10- to 20-fold improvement in the case of available 
energy (exergy) analysis, with the highest improvement potentials at the end-user and service-provisioning levels. Realisable service-level 
efficiency improvements could reduce upstream energy demand by 
45% in 2050. {5.3.2, Figure 5.10}
Alternative service provision systems, for example those 
enabled through digitalisation, sharing economy initiatives 
and circular economy initiatives, have to date made a limited 
contribution to climate change mitigation (medium confidence). 
While digitalisation through specific new products and applications 
holds potential for improvement in service-level efficiencies, without 
public policies and regulations, it also has the potential to increase 
consumption and energy use. Reducing the energy use of data centres, 
networks, and connected devices is possible in managing low-carbon 
digitalisation. Claims on the benefits of the circular economy for 
sustainability and climate change mitigation have limited evidence. 
{5.3.4, 5.3.4.1, 5.3.4.2, Figure 5.12, Figure 5.13}
Social Aspects of Demand-side Mitigation Actions
Decent living standards and well-being for all are achievable 
through the implementation of high-efficiency low demand 
mitigation pathways (medium confidence). Decent living standards 
(DLS) – a benchmark of minimum material conditions for human well-
being  – overlaps with many Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
Minimum requirements of energy use consistent with enabling 
well-being for all is between 20 and 50 GJ per person per year (cap–1 yr –1) 
depending on the context. {5.2.2.1, 5.2.2.2, Box 5.3}
Providing better services with less energy and resource 
input has high technical potential and is consistent with 
providing well-being for all (medium confidence). Assessment 
of 19 demand-side mitigation options and 18 different constituents 
of well-being show that positive impacts on well-being outweigh 
negative ones by a factor of 11. {5.2, 5.2.3, Figure 5.6}
Demand-side mitigation options bring multiple interacting 
benefits (high confidence). Energy services to meet human needs 
for nutrition, shelter, health, and so on are met in many different ways, 
with different emissions implications that depend on local contexts, 
cultures, geography, available technologies, and social preferences. 
In the near term, many less-developed countries and poor people 
everywhere require better access to safe and low-emissions energy 
sources to ensure decent living standards and increase energy savings 
from service improvements by about 20–25%. {5.2, 5.4.5, Figure 5.3, 
Figure 5.4, Figure 5.5, Figure 5.6, Box 5.2, Box 5.3}
Granular technologies and decentralised energy end use, 
characterised by modularity, small unit sizes and small unit 
costs, diffuse faster into markets and are associated with 
faster technological learning benefits, greater efficiency, more 
opportunities to escape technological lock-in, and greater 
employment (high confidence) . Examples include solar photovoltaic 
systems, batteries, and thermal heat pumps. {5.3, 5.5, 5.5.3}
Wealthy individuals contribute disproportionately to higher 
emissions and have a high potential for emissions reductions 
(high confidence). Individuals with high socio-economic status 
are capable of reducing their GHG emissions by becoming role 
models of low-carbon lifestyles, investing in low-carbon businesses, 
and advocating for stringent climate policies. {5.4.1, 5.4.3, 5.4.4, 
Figure 5.14}
Demand-side solutions require both motivation and capacity 
for change (high confidence). Motivation by individuals or 
households worldwide to change energy consumption behaviour is 
generally low. Individual behavioural change is insufficient for climate 
change mitigation unless embedded in structural and cultural change. 
Different factors influence individual motivation and capacity for 
change in different demographics and geographies. These factors go 
beyond traditional socio-demographic and economic predictors and 
include psychological variables such as awareness, perceived risk, 
subjective and social norms, values, and perceived behavioural control. 
Behavioural nudges promote easy behaviour change, for example 
‘Improve’  actions such as making investments in energy efficiency, 
but fail to motivate harder lifestyle changes (high confidence). {5.4}
Meta-analyses demonstrate that behavioural interventions, 
including the way choices are presented to consumers,1 work 
synergistically with price signals, making the combination 
more effective (medium confidence). Behavioural interventions 
through nudges, and alternative ways of redesigning and motivating 
decisions, alone provide small to medium contributions to reduce 
energy consumption and GHG emissions. Green defaults, such as 
automatic enrolment in ‘green energy’ provision, are highly effective. 
Judicious labelling, framing, and communication of social norms can 
also increase the effect of mandates, subsidies, or taxes. {5.4, 5.4.1, 
Table 5.3a, Table 5.3b}
Coordinated change in several domains leads to the 
emergence of new low-carbon configurations with cascading 
mitigation effects (high confidence). Demand-side transitions 
involve interacting and sometimes antagonistic processes on the 
behavioural, socio-cultural, institutional, business, and technological 
dimensions. Individual- or sectoral-level change may be stymied by 
reinforcing social, infrastructural, and cultural lock-ins. Coordinating 
the way choices are presented to end users and planners, physical 
infrastructures, new technologies and related business models can 
rapidly realise system-level change. {5.4.2, 5.4.3, 5.4.4, 5.4.5, 5.5}
Cultural change, in combination with new or adapted 
infrastructure, is necessary to enable and realise many ‘Avoid’ 
and ‘Shift’ options (medium confidence). By drawing support 
from diverse actors, narratives of change can enable coalitions to 
form, providing the basis for social movements to campaign in favour 
of (or against) societal transformations. People act and contribute to 
climate change mitigation in their diverse capacities as consumers, 
citizens, professionals, role models, investors, and policymakers. 
{5.4, 5.5, 5.6}

underpins system change (high confidence). Collective action 
and social organising are crucial to shift the possibility space of public 
policy on climate change mitigation. For example, climate strikes have 
given voice to youth in more than 180 countries. In other instances, 
mitigation policies allow the active participation of all stakeholders, 
resulting in building social trust, new coalitions, legitimising change, 
and thus initiate a positive cycle in climate governance capacity and 
policies. {5.4.2, Figure 5.14}
Transition pathways and changes in social norms often start 
with pilot experiments led by dedicated individuals and 
niche groups (high confidence). Collectively, such initiatives 
can find entry points to prompt policy, infrastructure, and policy 
reconfigurations, supporting the further uptake of technological and 
lifestyle innovations. Individuals’ agency is central as social change 
agents and narrators of meaning. These bottom-up socio-cultural 
forces catalyse a  supportive policy environment, which enables 
changes. {5.5.2}
The current effects of climate change, as well as some mitigation 
strategies, are threatening the viability of existing business 
practices, while some corporate efforts also delay mitigation 
action (medium confidence). Policy packages that include job 
creation programmes help to preserve social trust, livelihoods, 
respect, and dignity of all workers and employees involved. Business 
models that protect rent-extracting behaviour may sometimes delay 
political action. Corporate advertisement and marketing strategies 
may also attempt to deflect corporate responsibility to individuals 
or aim to appropriate climate care sentiments in their own brand 
building. {5.4.3, 5.6.4}
Middle actors – professionals, experts, and regulators – play 
a  crucial, albeit underestimated and underutilised, role in 
establishing low-carbon standards and practices (medium 
confidence). Building managers, landlords, energy efficiency 
advisers, technology installers, and car dealers influence patterns 
of mobility and energy consumption by acting as middle actors or 
intermediaries in the provision of building or mobility services and 
need greater capacity and motivation to play this role. {5.4.3}
Social influencers and thought leaders can increase the 
adoption of low-carbon technologies, behaviours, and lifestyles 
(high confidence). Preferences are malleable and can align with 
a cultural shift. The modelling of such shifts by salient and respected 
community members can help bring about changes in different 
service provisioning systems. Between 10% and 30% of committed 
individuals are required to set new social norms. {5.2.1, 5.4}
Preconditions and Instruments to Enable 
Demand-side Transformation
Social equity reinforces capacity and motivation for mitigating 
climate change (medium confidence). Impartial governance 
by gender, and income equity, increases social trust, thus enabling 
demand-side climate policies. High status (often high carbon) item 
consumption may be reduced by taxing absolute wealth without 
compromising well-being. {5.2, 5.4.2, 5.6}
Policies that increase the political access and participation 
of women, racialised, and marginalised groups increase the 
democratic impetus for climate action (high confidence) . 
Including more differently situated knowledge and diverse perspectives 
makes climate mitigation policies more effective. {5.2, 5.6}
Carbon pricing is most effective if revenues are redistributed 
or used impartially (high confidence). A carbon levy earmarked 
for green infrastructures or saliently returned to taxpayers 
corresponding to widely accepted notions of fairness increases the 
political acceptability of carbon pricing. {5.6, Box 5.11}
Greater contextualisation and granularity in policy approaches 
better addresses the challenges of rapid transitions towards 
zero-carbon systems (high confidence). Larger systems take 
more time to evolve, grow, and change compared to smaller ones. 
Creating and scaling up entirely new systems takes longer than 
replacing existing technologies and practices. Late adopters tend to 
adopt faster than early pioneers. Obstacles and feasibility barriers 
are high in the early transition phases. Barriers decrease as a result 
of technical and social learning processes, network building, scale 
economies, cultural debates, and institutional adjustments. {5.5, 5.6}
The lockdowns implemented in many countries in response 
to the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that behavioural 
change at a massive scale and in a short time is possible (high 
confidence). COVID-19 accelerated some specific trends, such as 
increased uptake of urban cycling. However, the acceptability of 
collective social change over a longer term towards less resource-
intensive lifestyles depends on social mandate building through 
public participation, discussion and debate over information provided 
by experts, to produce recommendations that inform policymaking. 
{Box 5.2}
Mitigation policies that integrate and communicate with the 
values people hold are more successful (high confidence). Values 
differ between cultures. Measures that support autonomy, energy 
security and safety, equity and environmental protection, and fairness 
resonate well in many communities and social groups. Changing from 
a commercialised, individualised, entrepreneurial training model to an 
education cognisant of planetary health and human well-being can 
accelerate climate change awareness and action. {5.4.1, 5.4.2}
Changes in consumption choices that are supported by 
structural changes and political action enable the uptake of 
low-carbon choices (high confidence). Policy instruments applied 
in coordination can help to accelerate change in a consistent desired 
direction. Targeted technological change, regulation, and public 
policy can help in steering digitalisation, the sharing economy, and 
circular economy towards climate change mitigation. {5.3, 5.6}Complementarity in policies helps in the design of an optimal 
demand-side policy mix (medium confidence). In the case of 
energy efficiency, for example, this may involve CO 2 pricing, standards 
and norms, and information feedback. {5.3, 5.4, 5.6}
The Sixth Assessment Report of the IPCC (AR6), for the first time, 
features a  chapter on demand, services, and social aspects of 
mitigation. It builds on the AR4 and AR5, which linked behaviour and 
lifestyle change to mitigating climate change (IPCC 2007; Roy and Pal 
2009; IPCC 2014a), the Global Energy Assessment (Roy et al. 2012), 
and the AR5, which identified sectoral demand-side mitigation options 
across chapters (IPCC 2014a; IPCC 2014b; Creutzig et al. 2016b). The 
literature on the nature, scale, implementation and implications of 
demand-side solutions, and associated changes in lifestyles, social 
norms, and well-being, has been growing rapidly (Creutzig et  al. 
2021a) (Box 5.2). Demand-side solutions support near-term climate 
change mitigation (Méjean et al. 2019; Wachsmuth and Duscha 2019) 
and include consumers’ technology choices, behaviours, lifestyle 
changes, coupled with production-consumption infrastructures and 
systems, service provision strategies, and associated socio-technical 
transitions. This chapter’s assessment of the social sciences (also see 
Chapter 5 Supplementary Material I) reveals that social dynamics at 
different levels offer diverse entry points for acting on and mitigating 
climate change (Jorgenson et al. 2018).
Three entry points are relevant for this chapter. First, well-designed 
demand for services scenarios are consistent with adequate levels 
of well-being for everyone (Rao and Baer 2012; Grubler et al. 2018; 
Mastrucci et al. 2020; Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020), with high and/
or improved quality of life (Max-Neef 1995), improved levels of 
happiness (Easterlin et al. 2010) and sustainable human development 
(Arrow et al. 2013; Dasgupta and Dasgupta 2017).
Second, demand-side solutions support staying within planetary 
boundaries (Haberl et  al. 2014; Matson et  al. 2016; Hillebrand 
et al. 2018; Andersen and Quinn 2020; UNDESA 2020; Hickel et al. 
2021; Keyßer and Lenzen 2021). Demand side solutions entail 
fewer environmental risks than many supply-side technologies (Von 
Stechow et al. 2016). Additionally they make carbon dioxide removal 
technologies, such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage 
(BECCS) less relevant (Van Vuuren et al. 2018) but modelling studies 
(Grubler et al. 2018; Hickel et al. 2021; Keyßer and Lenzen 2021) still 
require ecosystem-based carbon dioxide removal. In the IPCC’s Special 
Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5) (IPCC 2018), four stylised 
scenarios have explored possible pathways towards stabilising global 
warming at 1.5°C (IPCC 2014a, Figure SPM.3a) (Figure 5.1) One of 
these scenarios, LED-19, investigates the scope of demand-side 
solutions (Figure 5.1). The comparison of scenarios reveals that such 
low energy demand pathways eliminate the need for technologies 
with high uncertainty, such as BECCS. Third, interrogating demand 
for services from the well-being perspective also opens new avenues 
for assessing mitigation potentials (Brand-Correa and Steinberger 
2017; Mastrucci and Rao 2017; Rao and Min 2018a; Mastrucci 
and Rao 2019; Baltruszewicz et  al. 2021). Arguably, demand-side 
interventions often operate institutionally or in terms of restoring 
natural functioning and have so far been politically sidelined but 
COVID-19 revealed interesting perspectives (Box 5.2). Such demand-
side solutions also support near-term goals towards climate change 
mitigation and reduce the need for politically challenging high global 
carbon prices (Méjean et al. 2019) (Box 5.11). The well-being focus emphasises equity and universal need satisfaction, compatible with 
progress towards meeting the Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs) (Lamb and Steinberger 2017).
The requisites for well-being include collective and social interactions 
as well as consumption-based material inputs. Moreover, rather than 
material inputs per se, people need and demand services for dignified 
survival, sustenance, mobility, communication, comfort and material 
well-being (Nakićenović et al. 1996b; Johansson et al. 2012; Creutzig 
et al. 2018). These services may be provided in many different context-
specific ways using physical resources (biomass, energy, materials, 
etc.) and available technologies (e.g.,  cooking tools, appliances). 
Here we understand demand as demand for services (often requiring 
material input), with particular focus on services that are required for 
well-being (such as lighting, accessibility, shelter, etc.), and that are 
shaped by culturally and geographically differentiated social aspects, 
choice architectures and the built environment (infrastructures).
Focusing on demand for services broadens the climate solution space 
beyond technological switches confined to the supply side, to include 
solutions that maintain or improve well-being related to nutrition, 
shelter and mobility while (sometimes radically) reducing energy and 
material input levels (Creutzig et  al. 2018; Cervantes Barron 2020; 
Baltruszewicz et al. 2021; Kikstra et al. 2021b). This also recognises 
that mitigation policies are politically, economically and socially 
more feasible, as well as more effective, when there is a  two-way 
alignment between climate action and well-being (OECD 2019a). 
There is medium evidence and high agreement that well-designed 
demand for services scenarios are consistent with adequate levels 
of well-being for everyone (Rao and Baer 2012; Grubler et al. 2018; 
Rao et al. 2019b; Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020; Kikstra et al. 2021b), 
with high and/or improved quality of life (Max-Neef 1995; Vogel et al. 
2021) and improved levels of happiness (Easterlin et  al. 2010) and 
sustainable human development (Gadrey and Jany-Catrice 2006; 
Arrow et al. 2013; Dasgupta and Dasgupta 2017). While demand for 
services is high as development levels increase, and related emissions 
are growing in many countries (Yumashev et al. 2020; Bamisile et al. 
2021), there is also evidence that provisioning systems delink services 
provided from emissions (Conte Grand 2016; Patra et  al. 2017; 
Kavitha et  al. 2020). Various mitigation strategies, often classified 
into Avoid-Shift-Improve (ASI) options, effectively reduce primary 
energy demand and/or material input (Haas et al. 2015; Haberl et al. 
2017; Samadi et al. 2017; Hausknost et al. 2018; Haberl et al. 2019; 
Van den Berg et al. 2019; Ivanova et al. 2020). Users’ participation in 
decisions about how services are provided, not just their technological 
feasibility, is an important determinant of their effectiveness and 
sustainability (Whittle et al. 2019; Vanegas Cantarero 2020).
Sector-specific mitigation approaches (Chapters 6–11) emphasise 
the potential of mitigation via improvements in energy- and 
materials-efficient manufacturing (Gutowski et  al. 2013; Gramkow 
and Anger-Kraavi 2019; Olatunji et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2019), new 
product design (Fischedick et  al. 2014), energy-efficient buildings 
(Lucon et al. 2014), shifts in diet (Bajželj et al. 2014; Smith et al. 2014), 
transport infrastructure design (Sims et al. 2014), and compact urban 
forms (Seto et  al. 2014). In this chapter, service-related mitigation 
strategies are categorised as ‘Avoid’, ‘Shift’, or ‘Improve’ options to 
them, are much broader than usually considered in traditional sector-
specific presentations. ASI originally arose from the need to assess 
the staging and combinations of inter-related mitigation options 
in the provision of transportation services (Hidalgo and Huizenga 
2013). In the context of transportation services, ASI seeks to mitigate 
emissions through  avoiding as much transport service demand as 
possible (e.g., through telework to eliminate commutes, mixed-use 
urban zoning to shorten commute distances), shifting remaining 
demand to more efficient modes (e.g.,  bus rapid transit replacing 
passenger vehicles), and improving the carbon intensity of modes 
utilised (e.g., electric buses powered by renewables) (Creutzig et al. 
2016a). This chapter summarises ASI options and potentials across 
sectors and generalises the definitions. ‘Avoid’ refers to all mitigation 
options that reduce unnecessary (in the sense of being not required 
to deliver the desired service output) energy consumption by 
redesigning service provisioning systems; ‘Shift’ refers to the switch 
to already existing competitive efficient technologies and service 
provisioning systems; and ‘Improve’ refers to improvements in 
efficiency in existing technologies. The Avoid-Shift-Improve framing 
operates in three domains: Socio-cultural, where social norms, 
culture, and individual choices play an important role – a category 
especially, but not only, relevant for ‘Avoid’ options; Infrastructure, 
which provides the cost and benefit landscape for realising options 
and is particularly relevant for ‘Shift’ options; and Technologies, 
especially important for the ‘Improve’ options.
‘Avoid’, ‘Shift’, and ‘Improve’ choices will be made by individuals and 
households, instigated by salient and respected role models and novel 
social norms, but will require support by adequate infrastructures designed by urban planners and building and transport professionals, 
corresponding investments, and a  political culture supportive of 
mitigation action. This is particularly true for many ‘Avoid’ and ‘Shift’ 
decisions that are difficult because they encounter psychological 
barriers of breaking routines, habits and imagining new lifestyles 
and the social costs of not conforming to society (Kaiser 2006). 
Simpler ‘Improve’ decisions like energy efficiency investments, on 
the other hand, can be triggered and sustained by traditional policy 
instruments, complemented by behavioural nudges.
A key concern about climate change mitigation policies is that 
they may reduce quality of life. Based on growing literature, in 
this chapter we adopt the concept of decent living standards (DLS, 
explained further in relation to other individual and collective well-
being measures and concepts in the Social Science Primer, Chapter 5 
Supplementary Material I) as a universal set of service requirements 
essential for achieving basic human well-being. DLS includes the 
dimensions of nutrition, shelter, living condition, clothing, health care, 
education, and mobility (Frye et al. 2018; Rao and Min 2018b). DLS 
provides a fair, direct way to understand the basic low-carbon energy 
needs of society and specifies the underlying minimum material and 
energy requirements. This chapter also comprehensively assesses 
related well-being metrics that result from demand-side action, 
observing overall positive effects (Section 5.3). Similarly, ambitious 
low-emissions demand-side scenarios suggest that well-being 
could be maintained or improved while reducing global final energy 
demand, and some current literature estimates that it is possible 
to meet decent living standards for all within the 2°C warming 
window (Grubler et al. 2018; Burke 2020; Keyßer and Lenzen 2021) 
(Section 5.4). A key concern here is how to blend new technologies

modalities and Avoiding certain kinds of emissions altogether 
(Section 5.6).
Social practice theory emphasises that material stocks and social 
relations are key in forming and maintaining habits (Reckwitz 2002; 
Haberl et al. 2021). This chapter reflects these insights by assessing 
the role of infrastructures and social norms in GHG emission-intensive 
or low-carbon lifestyles (Section 5.4).
A core operational principle for sustainable development is equitable 
access to services to provide well-being for all, while minimising 
resource inputs and environmental and social externalities/trade-
offs, underpinning the Sustainable Development Goals (Princen 
2003; Lamb and Steinberger 2017; Dasgupta and Dasgupta 2017). 
Sustainable development is not possible without changes in consumption patterns within the widely recognised constraints of 
planetary boundaries, resource availability, and the need to provide 
decent living standards for all (Langhelle 2000; Toth and Szigeti 
2016; O’Neill et  al. 2018). Inversely, reduced poverty and higher 
social equity offer opportunities for delinking demand for services 
from emissions, for example via more long-term decision-making 
after having escaped poverty traps and by reduced demand for 
non-well-being-enhancing status consumption (Nabi et  al. 2020; 
Ortega-Ruiz et al. 2020; Parker and Bhatti 2020; Teame and Habte 
2020) (Section 5.3).
Throughout this chapter we discuss how people can realise various 
opportunities to reduce GHG emission-intensive consumption 
(Sections 5.2 and 5.3), and act in various roles (Section  5.4), 
within an enabling environment created by policy instruments and 
infrastructure that build on social dynamics (Section 5.6).
Box 5.1 | Bibliometric Foundation of Demand-side Climate Change Mitigation
A bibliometric overview of the literature found 99,065 academic peer-reviewed papers identified with 34 distinct search queries 
addressing relevant content of this chapter (Creutzig et al. 2021a). The literature is growing rapidly (15% yr –1) and the literature body 
assessed in the AR6 period (2014–2020) is twice as large as all literature published before.

being, services, equity, trust, and governance. Section 5.3 quantifies 
the demand-side opportunity space for mitigation, relying on the 
Avoid-Shift-Improve framework. Section  5.4 assesses the relevant 
contribution of different parts of society to climate change mitigation. 
Section  5.5 evaluates the overall dynamics of social transition processes while Section 5.6 summarises insights on governance and 
policy packages for demand-side mitigation and well-being. A Social 
Science Primer (Chapter  5 Supplementary Material I) defines and 
discusses key terms and social science concepts used in the context 
of climate change mitigation.Box 5.1 (continued)
A large part of the literature is highly repetitive and/or includes no concepts or little quantitative or qualitative data of relevance to 
this chapter. For example, a systematic review on economic growth and decoupling identified more than 11,500 papers treating this 
topic, but only 834 of those, that is, 7%, included relevant data (Wiedenhofer et al. 2020). In another systematic review, assessing 
quantitative estimates of consumption-based solutions (Ivanova et al. 2020), only 0.8% of papers were considered after consistency 
criteria were enforced. Altogether, we relied on systematic reviews wherever possible. Other important papers were not captured by 
systematic reviews but are included in this chapter through expert judgement. Based on topical modelling and relevance coding of 
resulting topics, the full literature body can be mapped into two dimensions, where spatial relationships indicate topical distance 
(Box  5.1, Figure  1). The interpretation of topics demonstrates that the literature organises in four clusters of high relevance for 
demand-side solutions (housing, mobility, food, and policy), whereas other clusters (nature, energy supply) are relatively less relevant. 
Box 5.2 | COVID-19, Service Provisioning and Climate Change Mitigation
There is now high evidence and high agreement that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the political feasibility of large-scale 
government actions to support the services for provision of public goods, including climate change policies. Many behavioural changes 
due to COVID-19 reinforce sufficiency and emphasis on solidarity, economies built around care, livelihood protection, collective action, 
and basic service provision, linked to reduced emissions.
COVID-19 led to direct and indirect health, economic, and confinement-induced hardships and suffering, mostly for the poor, and 
reset habits and everyday behaviours of the well-off too, enabling a reflection on the basic needs for a good life. Although COVID-19 
and climate change pose different kinds of threats and therefore elicit different policies, there are several lessons from COVID-19 for 
advancing climate change mitigation (Klenert et al. 2020; Manzanedo and Manning 2020; Stark 2020). Both crises are global in scale, 
requiring holistic societal response; governments can act rapidly, and delay in action is costly (Bouman et al. 2020a; Klenert et al. 2020). 
The pandemic highlighted the role of individuals in collective action and many people felt morally compelled and responsible to act for 
others (Budd and Ison, 2020). COVID-19 also taught the effectiveness of rapid collective action (physical distancing, wearing masks, 
etc.) as contributions to the public good. The messaging about social distancing, wearing masks and handwashing during the pandemic 
called attention to the importance of effective public information (e.g., also about reducing personal carbon footprints), recognising that 
rapid pro-social responses are driven by personal and socio-cultural norms (Bouman et al. 2020a; Sovacool et al. 2020a). In contrast, low 
trust in public authorities impairs the effectiveness of policies and polarises society (Bavel et al. 2020; Hornsey 2020).
During the shutdown, emissions declined relatively most in aviation, and absolutely most in car transport (Le Quéré et al. 2020, 
Sarkis et al. 2020), and there were disproportionally strong reductions in GHG emissions from coal (Bertram et al. 2021) (Chapter 2). 
At their peak, CO 2 emissions in individual countries decreased by 17% on average (Le Quéré et al. 2020). Global energy demand was 
projected to drop by 5% in 2020, energy-related CO 2 emissions by 7%, and energy investment by 18% (IEA 2020a). COVID-19 shock 
and recovery scenarios project final energy demand reductions of 1–36 EJ yr−1 by 2025 and cumulative CO 2 emission reductions of 
14–45 GtCO 2 by 2030 (Kikstra et al. 2021a). Plastics use and waste generation increased during the pandemic (Klemeš et al. 2020; 
Prata et al. 2020). Responses to COVID-19 had important connections with energy demand and GHG emissions due to quarantine and 
travel restrictions (Sovacool et al. 2020a). Reductions in mobility and economic activity reduced energy use in sectors such as industry 
and transport, but increased energy use in the residential sector (Diffenbaugh et al. 2020). COVID-19 induced behavioural changes 
that may translate into new habits, some beneficial and some harmful for climate change mitigation. New digitally-enabled service 
accessibility patterns (videoconferencing, telecommuting) played an important role in sustaining various service needs while avoiding 
demand for individual mobility. However, public transit lost customers to cars, personalised two wheelers, walking and cycling, while 
suburban and rural living gained popularity, possibly with long-term consequences. Reduced air travel, pressures for more localised
in Demand-side Mitigation
As outlined in section 5.1, mitigation, equity and well-being go hand 
in hand to motivate actions. Global, regional, and national actions 
and policies that advance inclusive well-being and build social trust 
strengthen governance. There is high evidence and high agreement that 
demand-side measures cut across all sectors, and can bring multiple 
benefits (Mundaca et al. 2019; Wachsmuth and Duscha 2019; Geels 
2020; Niamir et al. 2020b; Garvey et al. 2021; Roy et al. 2021). Since 
effective demand requires affordability, one of the necessary conditions 
for acceleration of mitigation through demand-side measures is wide 
and equitable participation from all sectors of society. Low-cost low-
emissions technologies, supported by institutions and government 
policies, can help meet service demand and advance both climate 
and well-being goals (Steffen et  al. 2018a; Khosla et  al. 2019). This 
section introduces metrics of well-being and their relationship to GHG 
emissions, and clarifies the concept of service provisioning.
5.2.1 Metrics of Well-being and their Relationship 
to Greenhouse Gas Emissions
There is high evidence and high agreement in the literature that 
human well-being and related metrics provide a societal perspective which is inclusive, compatible with sustainable development, and 
generates multiple ways to mitigate emissions. Development targeted 
to basic needs and well-being for all entails less carbon intensity than 
GDP-focused growth (Rao et al. 2014; Lamb and Rao 2015).
Current socioeconomic systems are based on high-carbon economic 
growth and resource use (Steffen et  al. 2018b). Several systematic 
reviews confirm that economic growth is tightly coupled with 
increasing CO 2 emissions (Ayres and Warr 2005; Tiba and Omri 
2017; Mardani et  al. 2019; Wiedenhofer et  al. 2020) although the 
level of emissions depends on inequality (Baležentis et al. 2020; Liu 
et al. 2020b), and on geographic and infrastructural constraints that 
force consumers to use fossil fuels (Pottier et  al. 2021). Different 
patterns emerge in the causality of the energy–growth nexus: 
(i) energy consumption causes economic growth; (ii) growth causes 
energy consumption; (iii) bidirectional causality; and (iv) no significant 
causality (Ozturk 2010). In a systematic review, Mardani et al. (2019) 
found that in most cases, energy use and economic growth have 
a  bidirectional causal effect, indicating that as economic growth 
increases, further CO 2 emissions are stimulated at higher levels; in turn, 
measures designed to lower GHG emissions may reduce economic 
growth. However, energy substitution and efficiency gains may offer 
opportunities to break the bidirectional dependency (Komiyama 
2014; Brockway et  al. 2017; Shuai et  al. 2019). Worldwide trends 
reveal that at best only relative decoupling (resource use grows at Box 5.2 (continued)
food and manufacturing supply chains (Hobbs 2020; Nandi et al. 2020; Quayson et al. 2020), and governments’ revealed willingness 
to make large-scale interventions in the economy also reflect sudden shifts in service provisions and GHG emissions, some likely to be 
lasting (Aldaco et al. 2020; Bilal et al. 2020; Boyer 2020; Hepburn et al. 2020; Norouzi et al. 2020; Prideaux et al. 2020; Sovacool et al. 
2020a). If changes in some preference behaviours, for example for larger homes and work environments to enable home working and 
online education, lead to sprawling suburbs or gentrification with linked environmental consequences, this could translate into long-
term implications for climate change (Beaunoyer et al. 2020; Diffenbaugh et al. 2020). Recovering from the pandemic by adopting low 
energy demand practices – embedded in new travel, work, consumption and production behaviour and patterns – could reduce carbon 
prices for a 1.5°C consistent pathway by 19%, reduce energy supply investments until 2030 by USD1.8 trillion, and lessen pressure on 
the upscaling of low-carbon energy technologies (Kikstra et al. 2021a).
COVID-19 drove hundreds of millions of people below poverty thresholds, reversing decades of poverty reduction accomplishments (Krieger 
2020; Mahler et al. 2020; Patel et al. 2020; Sumner et al. 2020) and raising the spectre of intersecting health and climate crises that are 
devastating for the most vulnerable (Flyvbjerg 2020; Phillips et al. 2020). Like those of climate change, pandemic impacts fall heavily on 
disadvantaged groups, exacerbate the uneven distribution of future benefits, amplify existing inequities, and introduce new ones (Beaunoyer 
et al. 2020; Devine-Wright et al. 2020). Addressing such inequities is a positive step towards the social trust that leads to improved climate 
policies as well as individual actions. Increased support for care workers and social infrastructures within a solidarity economy is consistent 
with lower-emission economic transformation (Shelley 2017; Di Chiro 2019; Pichler et al. 2019; Smetschka et al. 2019).
Fiscally, the pandemic may have slowed the transition to a sustainable energy world: governments redistributed public funding to combat 
the disease, adopted austerity and reduced capacity. Of nearly 300 policies implemented to counteract the pandemic, the vast majority are 
related to rescue, including worker and business compensation, and only 4% of these focus on green policies with potential to reduce GHG 
emissions in the long term; some rescue policies also assist emissions-intensive business (Hepburn et al. 2020; Leach et al. 2021). However, 
climate investments can double as the basis of the COVID-19 recovery (Stark 2020), with policies focused on both economic multipliers and 
climate impacts, such as clean physical infrastructure, natural capital investment, clean research and development (R&D) and education 
and training (Hepburn et al. 2020). This requires attention to investment priorities, including often-underprioritised social investment, given 
how inequality intersects with, and is a recognised core driver of, environmental damage and climate change (Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020).
(Jackson 2009; Krausmann et  al. 2009; Ward et  al. 2016; Jackson 
2016), while absolute decoupling (when material use declines as GDP 
grows) is rare, observed only during recessions or periods of low or 
no economic growth (Heun and Brockway 2019; Hickel and Kallis 
2019; Vadén et al. 2020; Wiedenhofer et al. 2020). Recent trends in 
OECD countries demonstrate the potential for absolute decoupling of 
economic growth not only from territorial but also from consumption-
based emissions (Le Quéré et al. 2019), albeit at scales insufficient for 
mitigation pathways (Vadén et al. 2020) (Chapter 2).
Energy demand and demand for GHG-intensive products increased 
from 2010 until 2020 across all sectors and categories. 2019 witnessed 
a reduction in energy demand growth rate to below 1% and 2020 
an overall decline in energy demand, with repercussions for energy 
supply disproportionally affecting coal via merit order effects (Bertram 
et al. 2021) (Cross-Chapter Box 1 in Chapter 1). There was a slight 
but significant shift from high-carbon beef consumption to medium-
carbon intensive poultry consumption. Final energy use in buildings 
grew from 118 EJ in 2010 to around 128 EJ in 2019 (increased about 
8%). The highest increase was observed in non-residential buildings, 
with a 13% increase against 8% in residential energy demand (IEA 
2019a). While electricity accounted for one-third of building energy 
use in 2019, fossil fuel use also increased at a marginal annual average 
growth rate of 0.7% since 2010 (IEA 2020a). Energy-related CO 2 
emissions from buildings have risen in recent years after flattening 
between 2013 and 2016. Direct and indirect emissions from electricity 
and commercial heat used in buildings rose to 10 GtCO 2 in 2019, the 
highest level ever recorded. Several factors have contributed to this 
rise, including growing energy demand for heating and cooling with 
rising air conditioner ownership and extreme weather events. A critical 
issue remains how comfortable people feel with temperatures 
they will be exposed to in the future and this depends on physical, 
psychological and behavioural factors (Singh et al. 2018; Jacobs et al. 
2019). Literature now shows high evidence and high agreement  
around the observation that policies and infrastructure interventions 
that lead to change in human preferences are more valuable for 
climate change mitigation. In economics, welfare evaluations are 
predominantly based on the preference approach. Preferences 
are  typically assumed to be fixed, so that only changes in relative 
prices will reduce emissions. However, as decarbonisation is a societal 
transition, individuals’ preferences do shift and this can contribute 
to climate change mitigation (Gough 2015). Even if preferences are 
assumed to change in response to policy, it is nevertheless possible 
to evaluate policy, and demand-side solutions, by approaches to well-
being and welfare that are based on deeper concepts of preferences 
across disciplines (Roy and Pal 2009; Fleurbaey and Tadenuma 2014; 
Komiyama 2014; Dietrich and  List 2016; Mattauch and Hepburn 
2016). In cases of past societal transitions, such as smoking reduction, 
there is evidence that societies guided the processes of shifting 
preferences, and values changed along with changing relative prices 
(Nyborg  and  Rege 2003; Stuber et  al. 2008; Brownell and Warner 
2009). Further evidence on changing preferences in consumption 
choices pertinent to decarbonisation includes Grinblatt et al. (2008) 
and Weinberger and Goetzke (2010) for mobility; Erb et  al. (2016), 
Muller  et  al. (2017),  and Costa and Johnson (2019) for diets; and 
Baranzini et al. (2017) for solar panel uptake. If individuals’ preferences and values change during a transition to the low-carbon economy, then 
this overturns conclusions on what count as adequate or even optimal 
policy responses to climate change mitigation in economics (Jacobsen 
et al. 2012; Schumacher 2015; Dasgupta et al. 2016; Daube and Ulph 
2016; Ulph and Ulph 2021). In particular, if policy instruments, such as 
awareness campaigns, infrastructure development or education, can 
change people’s preferences, then policies or infrastructure provision – 
socially constrained by deliberative decision making – which change 
both relative prices and preferences, are more valuable for mitigation 
than previously thought (Creutzig et al. 2016b; Mattauch et al. 2016; 
Mattauch et  al. 2018). The provisioning context of human needs is 
participatory, so transformative mitigation potential arises from social 
as well as technological change (Lamb and Steinberger 2017). Many 
dimensions of well-being and ‘basic needs’ are social, not individual, in 
character (Schneider 2016), so extending well-being and DLS analysis 
to emissions also involves understanding individual situations in social 
contexts. This includes building supports for collective strategies to 
reduce emissions (Chan et al. 2019), going beyond individual consumer 
choice. Climate policies that affect collective behaviour fairly are the 
most acceptable policies across political ideologies (Clayton 2018); 
thus collective preferences for mitigation are synergistic with evolving 
policies and norms in governance contexts that reduce risk, ensure 
social justice and build trust (Atkinson et  al. 2017; Cramton et  al. 
2017; Milkoreit 2017; Tvinnereim et al. 2017; Smith and Reid 2018; 
Carattini et al. 2019).
Because of data limitations, which can make cross-country 
comparisons difficult, health-based indicators and in particular life 
expectancy (Lamb et  al. 2014) have sometimes been proposed as 
quick and practical ways to compare local or national situations, 
climate impacts, and policy effects (Decancq et al. 2009; Sager 2017; 
Burstein et al. 2019). A number of different well-being metrics are 
valuable in emphasising the constituents of what is needed for 
a  decent life in different dimensions (Lamb and Steinberger 2017; 
Porter et al. 2017; Smith and Reid 2018). The SDGs overlap in many 
ways with such indicators, and the data needed to assess progress 
in meeting the SDGs is also useful for quantifying well-being (Gough 
2017). For the purposes of this chapter, indicators directly relating 
GHG emissions to well-being for all are particularly relevant.
Well-being can be categorised either as ‘hedonic’ or ‘eudaimonic’. 
Hedonic well-being is related to a  subjective state of human 
motivation, balancing pleasure over pain, and has gained influence 
in psychology assessing ‘subjective well-being’, assuming that the 
individual is motivated to enhance personal freedom, self-preservation 
and enhancement (Sirgy 2012; Brand-Correa and Steinberger 2017; 
Lamb and Steinberger 2017; Ganglmair-Wooliscroft and Wooliscroft 
2019). Eudaimonic well-being focuses on the individual in the broader 
context, associating happiness with virtue (Sirgy 2012), allowing for 
the creation of social institutions and political systems and considering 
their ability to enable individuals to flourish. Eudaimonic analysis 
supports numerous development approaches (Fanning and O’Neill 
2019) such as the capabilities (Sen 1985), human needs (Doyal and 
Gough 1991; Max-Neef et al. 1991) and models of psychosocial well-
being (Ryan and Deci 2001). Measures of well-being differ somewhat 
in developed and developing countries (Sulemana et al. 2016; Ng and 
Diener 2019); for example, food insecurity, associated everywhere 
poor subjective well-being in more-developed countries (Frongillo 
et al. 2019); in wealthier countries, the relationship between living in 
rural areas is less strongly associated with negative well-being than 
in less-developed countries (Requena 2016); and income inequality 
is negatively associated with subjective well-being in developed 
countries, but positively so in less-developed countries (Ngamaba 
et al. 2018). This chapter connects demand-side climate mitigation 
options to multiple dimensions of well-being, going beyond the 
single dimensional metric of GDP which is at the core of IAMs. Many 
demand side-mitigation solutions generate positive and negative 
impacts on wider dimensions of human well-being which are not 
always quantifiable (medium evidence, medium agreement).
5.2.1.1 Services for Well-being
Well-being needs are met through services. Provision of services 
associated with low energy demand is a key component of current 
and future efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Services can be 
provided in various culturally-appropriate ways, with diverse 
climate implications. There is high evidence and high agreement 
in the literature that many granular service provision systems can 
make ‘demand’ more flexible, provide new options for mitigation, 
support access to basic needs, and enhance human well-being. 
Energy services offer an important lens to analyse the relationship 
between energy systems and human well-being (Jackson and 
Papathanasopoulou 2008; Druckman and Jackson 2010; Mattioli 
2016; Walker et al. 2016; Fell 2017; Brand-Correa et al. 2018; King 
et al. 2019; Pagliano and Erba 2019; Whiting et al. 2020). Direct and 
indirect services provided by energy, rather than energy itself, deliver 
well-being benefits (Kalt et al. 2019). For example, illumination and 
transport are intermediary services in relation to education, health 
care, meal preparation, sanitation, and so on, which are basic human 
needs. Sustainable consumption and  production revolve around 
‘doing more and better with the same’ and thereby increasing well-
being from economic activities ‘by reducing resource use, degradation 
and pollution along the whole lifecycle, while increasing quality 
of life’ (UNEP 2010). Although energy is required for delivering 
human development by supporting access to basic needs (Lamb 
and Rao 2015; Lamb and Steinberger 2017), a reduction in primary 
energy use and/or shift to low-carbon energy, if associated with 
the maintenance or improvement of services, can not only ensure 
better environmental quality but also directly enhance well-being 
(Roy et al. 2012). The correlation between human development and 
emissions is not necessarily coupled in the long term, which implies 
there is a need to prioritise human well-being and the environment 
over economic growth (Steinberger et al. 2020). At the interpersonal 
and community levels, cultural specificities, infrastructure, norms, and 
relational behaviours differ (Box 5.3). For example, demand for space 
heating and cooling depends on building materials and designs, 
urban planning, vegetation, clothing and social norms as well as 
geography, incomes, and outside temperatures (Brand-Correa et al. 
2018; Campbell et al. 2018; Ivanova et al. 2018; IEA 2019b; Dreyfus 
et al. 2020). In personal mobility, different variable needs satisfiers 
(e.g.,  street space allocated to cars, buses or bicycles) can help 
satisfy human needs, such as accessibility to jobs, health care, and 
education. Social interactions and normative values play a  crucial role in determining energy demand. Hence, demand-side and service-
oriented mitigation strategies are most effective if geographically 
and culturally differentiated (Niamir et al. 2020a).
Decent living standards (DLS) serves as a socio-economic benchmark 
as it views human welfare not in relation to consumption but 
rather in terms of services which together help meet human needs 
(e.g.,  nutrition, shelter, health, etc.), recognising that these service 
needs may be met in many different ways (with different emissions 
implications) depending on local contexts, cultures, geography, 
available technologies, social preferences, and other factors. Therefore, 
one key way of thinking about providing well-being for all with low 
carbon emissions centres around prioritising ways of providing 
services for DLS in a  low-carbon way (including choices of needs 
satisfiers, and how these are provided or made accessible). They may 
be supplied to individuals or groups or communities, both through 
formal markets and/or informally, for example by collaborative 
work, in coordinated ways that are locally appropriate, designed and 
implemented in accordance with overlapping local needs.
The most pressing DLS service shortfalls, as shown in Figure 5.2, lie 
in the areas of nutrition, mobility, and communication. Gaps in regions 
such as Africa and the Middle East are accompanied by current levels 
of service provision in the highly industrialised countries at much 
higher than DLS levels for the same three service categories. The lowest 
population quartile by income worldwide faces glaring shortfalls 
in housing, mobility, and nutrition. Meeting these service needs 
using low-emissions energy sources is a top priority. Reducing GHG 
emissions associated with high levels of consumption and material 
throughput by those far above DLS levels has potential to address 
both emissions and inequality in energy and emission footprints 
(Otto et al. 2019). This, in turn, has further potential benefits; under 
the conditions of ‘fair’ income reallocation to public services, this can 
reduce national carbon footprint by up to 30% while allowing the 
consumption of those at the bottom to increase (Millward-Hopkins 
and Oswald 2021). The challenge then is to address the upper limits of 
consumption. When consumption only just supports the satisfaction 
of basic needs, any decrease causes deficiencies in human-need 
satisfaction. This is quite unlinke the case of consumption that 
exceeds the limits of basic needs, in which deprivation causes 
a  subjective discomfort (Brand-Correa et  al. 2020). Therefore, to 
collectively remain within environmental limits, the establishment of 
minimum and maximum standards of consumption, or sustainable 
consumption corridors, (Wiedmann et al. 2020) has been suggested, 
depending on the context. In some countries, carbon-intensive ways 
of satisfying human needs have been locked-in, for example via car-
dependent infrastructures (Jackson and Papathanasopoulou 2008; 
Druckman and Jackson 2010; Mattioli 2016; King et al. 2019), and 
both infrastructure reconfiguration and adaptation are required to 
organise need satisfaction in low-carbon ways (see also Section 10.2).
There is high evidence and high agreement in the literature that vital 
dimensions of human well-being correlate with consumption, but 
only up to a threshold. High potential for mitigation lies in using low-
carbon energy for new basic needs satisfaction while cutting emissions 
of those whose basic needs are already met (Grubler et  al.  2018; 
Rao and Min 2018b; Rao et al. 2019b; Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020;

tools to clarify this socio-economic benchmark and identify well-being 
for all compatible mitigation potential. Energy services provisioning 
opens up avenues of efficiency and possibilities for decoupling energy 
services demand from primary energy supply, while needs satisfaction 
leads to the analysis of the factors influencing the energy demand 
associated with the achievement of well-being (Brand-Correa and 
Steinberger 2017; Tanikawa et  al. 2021). Vital dimensions of well-
being correlate with consumption, but only up to a threshold: decent 
living energy thresholds range from about 13 to 18.4 GJ cap–1 yr –1 of 
final energy consumption but the current consumption ranges from 
under 5 GJ cap–1 yr –1 to over 200 GJ cap–1 yr–1 (Millward-Hopkins 
et  al. 2020), thus a  mitigation strategy that protects minimum 
levels of essential-goods service delivery for DLS, but critically 
views consumption beyond the point of diminishing returns of 
needs satisfaction, is able to sustain well-being while generating 
emissions reductions (Goldemberg et  al. 1988; Jackson and Marks 
1999; Druckman and Jackson 2010; Girod and De Haan 2010; Vita 
et  al. 2019a; Baltruszewicz et  al. 2021). Such relational dynamics 
are relevant both within and between countries, due to variances 
in income levels, lifestyle choice (see also Section 5.4.4), geography, resource assets and local contexts. Provisioning for human needs 
is recognised as participatory and inter-relational; transformative 
mitigation potential can be found in social as well as technological 
change (Mazur and Rosa 1974; Goldemberg et al. 1985; Lamb and 
Steinberger 2017; O’Neill et al. 2018; Hayward and Roy 2019; Vita 
et al. 2019a). More equitable societies which provide DLS for all can 
devote attention and resources to mitigation (Richards 2003; Dubash 
2013; Rafaty 2018; Oswald et  al. 2021). For further exploration of 
these concepts, see Chapter 5 Supplementary Material I.

people have little or no access to energy for clean cooking. About 
1.2 billion lack energy for cleaning, sanitation and water supply, 
lighting, and basic livelihood tasks (Sovacool and Drupady 2016; 
Rao and Pachauri 2017).The current per capita energy requirement 
to provide a  decent standard of living range from around 5 to 

Rao et al. 2019b; Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020), which shows the 
level of inequality that exists; this depends on the context, such 
as geography, culture, infrastructure or how services are provided 
(Brand-Correa et  al. 2018) (Box  5.3). However, through efficient 
technologies and radical demand-side transformations, the final 
energy requirements for providing DLS by 2050 is estimated at 
15.3  GJ cap–1 yr –1 (Millward-Hopkins et  al. 2020). Recent DLS 
estimates for Brazil, South Africa, and India are in the range between 

poor are often those living in informal settlements, particularly 
women, in sub-Saharan Africa and developing Asia, whose 
socially-determined responsibilities for food, water, and care are 
highly labour-intensive and made more intense by climate change (Guruswamy 2016; Wester et al. 2019). In Brazil, India and South 
Africa, where inequality is extreme (Alvaredo et al. 2018) mobility 
(51–60%), food production and preparation (21–27%) and housing 
(5–12%) dominate total energy needs (Rao et al. 2019b). Minimum 
requirements of energy use consistent with enabling well-being for 
all is between 20 and 50 GJ cap–1 yr –1 depending on context (Rao 
et al. 2019b). Inequality in access to and availability of services for 
human well-being varies in extreme degree across countries and 
income groups. In developing countries, the bottom 50% receive 
about 10% of the energy used in land transport and less than 5% 
in air transport, while the top 10% use about 45% of the energy 
for land transport and around 75% for air transport (Oswald et al. 
2020). Within-country analysis shows that particular groups in 
China – women born in the rural West with disadvantaged family 
backgrounds – face unequal opportunities for energy consumption 
(Shi 2019). Figure 5.3 shows the wide variation across world regions 
in people’s access to some of the basic material prerequisites for 
meeting DLS, and variations in energy consumption, providing 
a starting point for comparative global analysis.
Box 5.3 | Inequities in Access to and Levels of End-use Technologies and Infrastructure Services
Acceleration in mitigation action needs to be understood from a societal perspective. Technologies, access and service equity factors 
sometimes change rapidly. Access to technologies, infrastructures and products, and the services they provide, are essential for raising 
global living standards and improving human well-being (Alkire and Santos 2014; Rao and Min 2018b). Yet access to and levels 
of service delivery are distributed extremely inequitably as of now. How fast such inequities can be reduced by granular end-use 
technologies is illustrated by the cellphone (households with mobiles), comparing the situation between 2000 and 2018. In this 
eighteen-year period, cellphones changed from a very inequitably-distributed technology to one with almost universal access, bringing 
accessibility benefits especially to populations with very low disposable income and to those whose physical mobility is limited (Porter 
2016). Every human has the right to a dignified decent life, to live in good health and to participate in society. This is a daunting 
challenge, requiring that in the next decade governments build out infrastructure to provide billions of people with access to a number 
of services and basic amenities in comfortable homes, nutritious food, and transit options (Rao and Min 2018b). For a long time, this 
challenge was thought to also be an impediment to developing countries’ participation in global climate mitigation efforts. However, 
recent research shows that this need not be the case (Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020; Rao et al. 2019b).
Several of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (UN 2015) deal with providing access to technologies and service infrastructures 
to the share of population so far excluded, showing that the UN 2030 Agenda has adopted a multidimensional perspective on poverty. 
Multidimensional poverty indices, such as the Social Progress Indicator and the Individual Deprivation Measure, go beyond income 
and focus on tracking the delivery of access to basic services by the poorest population groups, both in developing countries (Fulton 
et al. 2009; Alkire and Santos 2014; Alkire and Robles 2017; Rao and Min 2018b), and in developed countries (Townsend 1979; 
Aaberge and Brandolini 2015; Eurostat 2018). At the same time, the SDGs, primarily SDG 10 on reducing inequalities within and 
among countries, promote a more equitable world, both in terms of inter- as well as intra-national equality.
Access to various end-use technologies and infrastructure services features directly in the SDG targets and among the indicators 
used to track their progress (UN 2015; UNESC 2017): Basic services in households (SDG 1.4.1), Improved water sources (SDG 6.1.1); 
Improved sanitation (SDG 6.1.2); Electricity (SDG 7.1.1); Internet – fixed broadband subscriptions (SDG 17.6.2); Internet – proportion 
of population using (SDG 17.8.1). Transport (public transit, cars, mopeds or bicycles) and media technologies (mobile phones, TVs, 
radios, PCs, Internet) can be seen as proxies for access to mobility and communication, crucial for participation in society and the 
economy (Smith et al. 2015). In addition, SDG 10 is a more conventional income-based inequality goal, referring to income inequality 
(SDG 10.1), social, economic and political inclusion of all (SDG 10.2.), and equal opportunities and reduced inequalities of outcome 
(SDG 10.3).
5.2.2.2 Variations in Energy Use
There is high evidence and high agreement in the literature that 
through equitable distribution, well-being for all can be assured at 
the lowest-possible energy consumption levels (Steinberger and 
Roberts 2010; Oswald et al. 2020) by reducing emissions related to 
consumption as much as possible, while assuring DLS for everyone 
(Annecke 2002; de Zoysa 2011; Ehrlich and Ehrlich 2013; Spangenberg 
2014; Toroitich and Kerber 2014; Kenner 2015; Toth and Szigeti 2016; 
Smil 2017; Otto et al. 2019; Baltruszewicz et al. 2021). For example, 
at similar levels of human development, per capita energy demand in the US was 63% higher than in Germany (Arto et al. 2016); those 
patterns are explained by context in terms of various climate, cultural 
and historical factors influencing consumption. Context matters even 
in within-country analysis, for example, electricity consumption in 
the US shows that efficiency innovations do exert positive influence 
on savings of residential energy consumption, but the relationship 
is mixed; on the contrary, affluence (household income and home 
size) and context (geographical location) drive resource utilisation 
significantly (Adua and Clark 2019); affluence is central to any future 
prospect in terms of environmental conditions (Wiedmann et  al. 
2020). In China, inequality of energy consumption and expenditure Box 5.3 (continued)

climatic region (Wu et al. 2017).
Consumption is energy- and materials-intensive and expands along 
with income. About half of the energy used in the world is consumed 
by the richest 10% of people, most of whom live in developed 
countries, especially when one includes the energy embodied in 
the goods they purchase from other countries and the structure of 
consumption as a function of income level (Arto et al. 2016; Wolfram 
et  al. 2016; Santillán Vera et  al. 2021). International trade plays 
a central role, being responsible for shifting burdens in most cases 
from low-income developing countries producers to high-income 
developed countries as consumers (Wiedmann et  al. 2020). China 
is the largest exporter to the EU and United States, and accounts 
for nearly half and 40% of their imports in energy use respectively 
(Wu et al. 2019). Wealthy countries have exported or outsourced their 
climate and energy crisis to low- and middle-income countries (Baker 
2018), exacerbated by intensive international trade (Steinberger 
et  al. 2012; Scherer et  al. 2018). Therefore, issues of total energy 
consumption are inseparably related to the energy inequity among 
the countries and regions of the world.
Within the energy use induced by global consumer products, 
household consumption is the biggest contributor, contributing to 
around three-quarters of the global total (Wu et al. 2019). A more 
granular analysis of household energy consumption reveals that 
the lowest two quintiles in countries with average annual income 
below USD15,000 cap–1 yr –1 consume less energy than the 
international energy requirements for DLS (20–50 GJ cap–1); 77% of 
people consume less than 30 GJ cap–1 yr –1 and 38% consume less 
than 10 GJ cap–1 yr –1 (Oswald et al. 2020). Many energy-intensive 
goods have high price elasticity (>1.0), implying that growing 
incomes lead to over-proportional growth of energy footprints in 
these consumption categories. Highly unequally distributed energy 
consumption is concentrated in the transport sector, ranging from 
vehicle purchase to fuels, and most unequally in package holidays 
and aviation (Gössling 2019; Oswald et al. 2020).
Socio-economic dynamics and outcomes affect whether provisioning 
of goods and services is achieved at low energy demand levels 
(Figure  5.4). Specifically, multivariate regression shows that public 
service quality, income equality, democracy, and electricity access 
enable higher need satisfaction at lower energy demand, whereas 
extractivism and economic growth beyond moderate levels of 
affluence reduce need satisfaction at higher energy demand (Vogel 
et  al. 2021). Altogether, this demonstrates that at a  given level of 
energy provided, there is large scope to improve service levels for 
well-being by modifying socio-economic context without increasing 
energy supply (Figure 5.4).
5.2.2.3 Variations in Consumption-based Emissions
The carbon footprint of a  nation is equal to the direct emissions 
occurring due to households’ transport, heating and cooking, as well 
as the impact embodied in the production of all consumed goods 
and services (Wiedmann and Minx 2008; Davis and Caldeira 2010; 
Hübler 2017; Vita et al. 2019a). There are large differences in carbon footprints between the poor and the rich. As a result of energy use 
inequality, the lowest global emitters (the poorest 10% in developing 
countries) in 2013 emitted about 0.1  tCO 2  cap–1  yr–1, whereas the 
highest global emitters (the top 1% in the richest countries) emitted 
about 200–300 tCO 2 cap–1 yr–1 (World Bank 2019). The poorest 50% 
of the world’s population are responsible for only about 10% of total 
lifetime consumption emissions, in contrast about 50% of the world’s 
GHG emissions can be attributed to consumption by the world’s richest 
10%, with the average carbon footprint of the richest being 175 times 
higher than that of the poorest 10% (Chancel and Piketty 2015). This 
richest 10% consumed the global carbon budget by nearly 30% during 
the period 1990–2015 (Kartha et al. 2020; Gore 2020). While mitigation 
efforts often focus on the poorest, the lifestyle and consumption 
patterns of the affluent often influence the growing middle class (Otto 
et  al. 2019). Across EU countries, only 5% of households are living 
within 1.5°C climate limits and the top 1% emit more than 22 times 
the target on average, with land and air transport being particular 
characteristics of the highest-emitting countries (Ivanova and Wood 
2020).
In low-income nations – which can exhibit per-capita carbon footprints 

emissions are predominantly domestic and driven by provision of 
essential services (shelter, low-meat diets, clothing). Per capita carbon 
footprints average 1.6 tonnes per year for the lowest income category, 
then quickly increase to 4.9 and 9.8 tonnes for the two middle-income 
categories and finally to an average of 17.9 tonnes for the highest 
income category. Global CO 2 emissions remain concentrated: the top 
10% of emitters contribute about 35–45% of the total, while the 
bottom 50% contribute just 13–15% of global emissions (Chancel and 
Piketty 2015; Hubacek et al. 2017). In wealthy nations, services such as 
private road transport, frequent air travel, private jet ownership, meat-
intensive diets, entertainment and leisure add significant emissions, 
while a considerable fraction of the carbon footprint is imported from 
abroad, embedded in goods and services (Hubacek et al. 2017).
High-income households consume and demand energy at an order of 
magnitude greater than what is necessary for DLS (Oswald et al. 2020). 
Energy-intensive goods, such as package holidays, have a  higher 
income elasticity of demand than less energy-intensive goods like 
food, water supply and housing maintenance, which results in high-
income individuals having much higher energy footprints (Oswald et al. 
2020). Evidence highlights highly unequal GHG emissions in aviation: 
only 2–4% of the global population flew internationally in 2018, with 
1% of the world population emitting 50% of CO 2 from commercial 
aviation (Gössling and Humpe 2020). Some individuals may add more 
than 1600 tCO 2 yr –1 individually by air travel (Gössling 2019).
The food sector dominates in all income groups, comprising 28% 
of households’ carbon footprint, with cattle and rice the major 
contributors (Scherer et al. 2018); food also accounts for 48% and 
70% of household impacts on land and water resources respectively, 
and consumption of meat, dairy, and processed food rise fast 
asincomes increase (Ivanova et al. 2016). Roughly 20–40% of food 
produced worldwide is lost to waste before it reaches the market, 
or is wasted by households, the energy embodied in wasted food was 
estimated at around 36 EJ yr –1, and during the period 2010–2016 
(Godfray and Garnett 2014; Springmann et  al. 2018; Mbow et  al. 
2019). Global agri-food supply chains are crucial in the variation 
of per  capita food consumption-related-GHG footprints, mainly in 
the case of red meat and dairy (Kim et al. 2020) since the highest 
per capita food-consumption-related GHG emissions do not correlate 
perfectly with the income status of countries. Thus, it is also crucial 
to focus on high-emitting individuals and groups within countries, 
rather than only those who live in high-emitting countries, since the 
top 10% of emitters live on all continents and one-third of them are 
from the developing world (Chakravarty et al. 2009; Pan et al. 2019).
The environmental impact of increasing equity across income 
groups can be either positive or negative (Hubacek et al. 2017; Rao 
and Min 2018a; Scherer et al. 2018; Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020). 
Projections for achieving equitable levels of service provision globally 
predict large increases in global GHG emissions and demand for key 
resources (Blomsma and Brennan 2017), especially in passenger 
transport, which is predicted to increase nearly three-fold between 

(OECD 2019a), and associated infrastructure needs, increasing freight 
(Murray et al. 2017), increasing demand for cooling (IEA 2018), and 
shifts to carbon-intensive high-meat diets (OECD/FAO 2018).
Increasing incomes for all to attain DLS raises emissions and energy 
footprints, but only slightly (Chakravarty et  al. 2009; Jorgenson 
et al. 2016; Scherer et al. 2018; Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020; Oswald 
et  al. 2020; Oswald et  al. 2021). The amount of energy needed for 
a high global level of human development is dropping (Steinberger and 
Roberts 2010) and could by 2050 be reduced to 1950 levels (Millward-
Hopkins et al. 2020) requiring a massive deployment of technologies 
across the different sectors as well as demand-side reduction 
consumption. The consumption share of the bottom half of the world’s 
population represents less than 20% of all energy footprints, which is 
less than what the top 5% of people consume (Oswald et al. 2020).
Income inequality itself also raises carbon emissions (Hao et al. 2016; 
Sinha 2016; Uzar and Eyuboglu 2019; Baloch et  al. 2020; Oswald 
et al. 2020; Wiedmann et al. 2020; Vogel et al. 2021). Wide inequality 
can increase status-based consumption patterns, where individuals 
spend more to emulate the standards of the high-income group (the 
Veblen effect); inequality also diminishes environmental efforts by 
reducing social cohesion and cooperation (Jorgenson et al. 2017) and 
finally, inequality also operates by inducing an increase in working 
hours that leads to higher economic growth and, consequently, 
higher emissions and ecological footprint, so working time reduction 
is key for policy to both reduce emissions and protect employment 
(Fitzgerald et al. 2015; Fitzgerald et al. 2018).
5.2.3 Equity, Trust, and Participation  
in Demand-side Mitigation
There is high evidence and high agreement in literature that socio-
economic equity builds not only well-being for all, but also trust and 
effective participatory governance, which in turn strengthen demand-
side climate mitigation. Equity, participation, social trust, well-being, governance and mitigation are parts of a  continuous interactive 
and self-reinforcing process (Figure 5.5). Chapter 5 Supplementary 
Material I (Section  5.SM.1) contains more detail on these links, 
drawing from social science literature.
Economic growth in equitable societies is associated with lower 
emissions than in inequitable societies (McGee and Greiner 2018), 
and income inequality is associated with higher global emissions 
(Ravallion et al. 1997; McGee and Greiner 2018; Rao and Min 2018c; 
Diffenbaugh and Burke 2019; Fremstad and Paul 2019; Liu and Hao 
2020). Relatively slight increases in energy consumption and carbon 
emissions produce great increases in human development and well-
being in less-developed countries, and the amount of energy needed 
for a high global level of human development is dropping (Steinberger 
and Roberts 2010). Equitable and democratic societies which provide 
high quality public services to their population have high well-being 
outcomes at lower energy use than those which do not, whereas 
those which prioritise economic growth beyond moderate incomes 
and extractive sectors display a reversed effect (Vogel et al. 2021).
Well-designed climate mitigation policies ameliorate constituents of 
well-being (Creutzig et al. 2021b). The study shows that of all demand-
side option effects on well-being, 79% are positive, 18% are neutral (or 
not relevant or specified), and only 3% are negative (high confidence) 
(Creutzig et  al. 2021b) (Figure  5.6). Figure  5.6 illustrates that active 
mobility (cycling and walking), efficient buildings and prosumer 
choices of renewable technologies have the most encompassing 
beneficial effects on well-being, with no negative outcomes detected. 
Urban and industry strategies are highly positive overall for well-
being, but they will also reshape supply-side businesses with transient 
intermediate negative effects. Shared mobility, like all the others, 
has overall highly beneficial effects on well-being, but also displays 
a few negative consequences, depending on implementation, such as 
a minor decrease in personal security for patrons of ride-sourcing.
Well-being improvements are most notable in health, air, and energy 
(high confidence). These categories are also most substantiated 
in the literature, often under the framing of co-benefits. In many 
cases, co-benefits outweigh the mitigation benefits of specific GHG 
emission reduction strategies. Food (medium confidence), mobility 
(high confidence), and water (medium confidence) are further 
categories where well-being is improved. Mobility has entries 
with highest well-being rankings for teleworking, compact cities, 
and urban system approaches. Effects on well-being in water and 
sanitation mostly come from buildings and urban solutions. Social 
dimensions, such as personal security, social cohesion, and especially 
political stability, are less predominantly represented. An exception 
is economic stability, suggesting that demand-side options generate 
stable opportunities to participate in economic activities (high 
confidence). Although the relation between demand-side mitigation 
strategies and the social aspects of human well-being is important, 
this has been less reflected in the literature so far, and hence the 
assessment finds more neutral/unknown interactions (Figure 5.6).
Policies designed to foster higher well-being for all via climate mitigation 
include reducing emissions through wider participation in climate 
action, building more effective governance for improved mitigation, 
as integral parts of climate policies. Public participation facilitates 
social learning and people’s support of and engagement with climate 
change priorities; improved governance is closely tied to effective 
climate policies (Phuong et al. 2017). Better education, health care, 
valuing of social diversity, and reduced poverty – characteristics of 
more equal societies – all lead to resilience, innovation, and readiness 
to adopt progressive and locally-appropriate mitigation policies, 
whether high-tech or low-tech, centralised or decentralised (Tanner 
et al. 2009; Lorenz 2013; Chu 2015; Cloutier et al. 2015; Mitchell 2015; 
Martin and Shaheen 2016; Vandeweerdt et al. 2016; Turnheim et al. 
2018). Moreover, these factors are the ones identified as enablers of 
high need satisfaction at lower energy use (Vogel et al. 2021).
There is less policy lock-in in more equitable societies (Seto et al. 2016). 
International communication, networking, and global connections 
among citizens are more prevalent in more equitable societies, and 
these help spread promising mitigation approaches (Scheffran et al. 
2012). Climate-related injustices are addressed where equity is 
prioritised (Klinsky and Winkler 2014). Thus, there is high confidence 
in the literature that addressing inequities in income, wealth, and 
DLS not only raises overall well-being and furthers the SDGs but also 
improves the effectiveness of climate change mitigation policies. For 
example, job creation, retraining for new jobs, local production of livelihood necessities, social provisioning, and other positive steps 
toward climate mitigation and adaptation are all associated with 
more equitable and resilient societies (Okvat and Zautra 2011; Bentley 
2014; Klinsky et al. 2016; Roy et al. 2018a). At all scales of governance, 
the popularity and sustainability of climate policies requires attention 
to the fairness of their health and economic implications for all, 
and participatory engagement across social groups – a responsible 
development framing (Cazorla and Toman 2001; Dulal et  al. 2009; 
Chuku 2010; Shonkoff et al. 2011; Navroz 2019; Hofstad and Vedeld 
2020; Muttitt and Kartha 2020; Roy and Schaffartzik 2020; Temper 
et  al. 2020; Waller et  al. 2020). Far from being secondary or even 
a  distraction from climate mitigation priorities, an equity focus is 
intertwined with mitigation goals (Klinsky et al. 2016). Demand-side 
climate mitigation options have pervasive ancillary, equity-enhancing 
benefits, for example for health, local livelihoods, and community forest 
resources (Chhatre and Agrawal 2009; Garg 2011; Shaw et al. 2014; 
Serrao-Neumann et al. 2015; Klausbruckner et al. 2016; Salas and Jha 
2019) (Figure  5.6). Limiting climate change risks is fundamental to 
collective well-being (Max-Neef et al. 1989; Yamin et al. 2005; Nelson 
et al. 2013; Gough 2015; Gough 2017; Pecl et al. 2017; Tschakert et al. 
2017). Section 5.6 discusses well-designed climate policies more fully, 
with examples. Rapid changes in social norms which are underway 
and which underlie socially-acceptable climate policy initiatives are 
discussed in section 5.4.Well-being for all

a  growing stream of social sciences literature with climate policy 
relevance (Arrow et al. 2004; Ramakrishnan and Creutzig 2021). Given 
growing public support worldwide for strong sustainability, sufficiency, 
and sustainable consumption, changing demand patterns and 
reduced demand are accompanying environmental and social benefits 
(Jackson 2008; Fedrigo et al. 2010; Schroeder 2013; Figge et al. 2014; 
Spangenberg and Germany 2016; Spengler 2016; Burke 2020; Mont 
et al. 2020). Beyond a threshold, increased material consumption is not 
closely correlated with improvements in human progress (Frank 1999; 
Kahneman and Deaton 2010; Steinberger and Roberts 2010; Roy et al. 
2012; Oishi et al. 2018; Xie et al. 2018; Vita et al. 2019b; Wang et al. 2019; 
Vita et al. 2020). Policies focusing on the ‘super-rich’, also called the 
‘polluter elite’, are gaining attention for moral or norms-based as well 
as emissions-control reasons (Kenner 2019; Otto et al. 2019; Pascale 
et al. 2020; Stratford 2020) (Section 5.2.2.3). Conspicuous consumption 
by the wealthy is the cause of a large proportion of emissions in all 
countries, related to expenditures on such things as air travel, tourism, 
large private vehicles and large homes (Brand and Boardman 2008; 
Roy and Pal 2009; Roy et al. 2012; Brand and Preston 2010; Gore 2015; 
Hubacek et al. 2017; Jorgenson et al. 2017; Sahakian 2018; Gössling 
2019; Kenner 2019; Lynch et al. 2019; Osuoka and Haruna 2019).
Since no country now meets its citizens’ basic needs at a  level of 
resource use that is globally sustainable, while high levels of life 
satisfaction for those just escaping extreme poverty require even 
more resources, the need for transformative shifts in governance and 
policies is large (O’Neill et al. 2018; Vogel et al. 2021).
Inequitable societies use energy and resources less efficiently. 
Higher income inequality is associated with higher carbon emissions, 
at least in developed countries (Grunewald et al. 2011; Golley and 
Meng 2012; Chancel et al. 2015; Grunewald et al. 2017; Jorgenson 
et  al. 2017; Sager 2017; Klasen 2018; Liu et  al. 2019); reducing 
inequality in high-income countries helps to reduce emissions (Klasen 
2018). There is high agreement in the literature that alienation or 
distrust weakens collective governance and fragments political 
approaches towards climate action (Smit and Pilifosova 2001; Adger 
et al. 2003; Hammar and Jagers 2007; Van Vossole 2012; Bulkeley 
and Newell 2015; Smith and Howe 2015; ISSC et al. 2016; Alvaredo 
et al. 2018; Smith and Mayer 2018; Fairbrother et al. 2019; Hayward 
and Roy 2019; Kulin and Johansson Sevä 2019; Liao et al. 2019).
Populism and politics of fear are less prevalent under conditions of 
more income equality (Chevigny 2003; Bryson and Rauwolf 2016; 
O’Connor 2017; Fraune and Knodt 2018; Myrick and Evans Comfort 
2019). Ideology and other social factors also play a role in populist 
climate scepticism, but many of these also relate to resentment of 
elites and desire for engagement (Swyngedouw 2011; Lockwood 
2018; Huber et al. 2020). ‘Climate populism’ movements are driven by 
an impetus for justice (Beeson 2019; Hilson 2019). When people feel 
powerless and/or that climate change is too big a problem to solve 
because others are not acting, they may take less action themselves 
(Williams and Jaftha 2020). However, systems for benefit-sharing 
can build trust and address large-scale ‘commons dilemmas’, in the 
context of strong civil society (Barnett 2003; Mearns and Norton 2009; 
Inderberg et al. 2015; Sovacool et al. 2015; Hunsberger et al. 2017; Soliev and Theesfeld 2020). Leadership is also important in fostering 
environmentally-responsible group behaviours (Liu and Hao 2020).
In some less-developed countries, higher income inequality may in 
fact be associated with lower per capita emissions, but this is because 
people who are excluded by poverty from access to fossil fuels must 
rely on biomass (Klasen 2018). Such energy poverty – the fact that 
millions of people do not have access to energy sources to help meet 
human needs  – implies the opposite of development (Guruswamy 
2010; Guruswamy 2020). In developing countries, livelihood 
improvements do not necessarily cause increases in emissions (Peters 
et al. 2012; Reusser et al. 2013; Creutzig et al. 2015a; Chhatre and 
Agrawal 2009; Baltruszewicz et  al. 2021) and poverty alleviation 
causes negligible emissions (Chakravarty et  al. 2009). Greater 
equity is an important step towards sustainable service provisioning 
(Godfray et al. 2018; Dorling 2019; Timko 2019).
As discussed in Section 5.6, policies to assist the low-carbon energy 
transition can be designed to include additional benefits for income 
equality, besides contributing to greater energy access for the poor 
(Burke and Stephens 2017; Frank 2017; Healy and Barry 2017; 
Sen 2017; Chapman et  al. 2018; La Viña et  al. 2018; Chapman 
and Fraser 2019; Piggot et al. 2019; Sunderland et al. 2020). Global 
and intergenerational climate inequities impact people’s well-being, 
which affects their consumption patterns and political actions 
(Albrecht et al. 2007; Fritze et al. 2008; Gori-Maia 2013; Clayton et al. 
2015; Pizzigati 2018) (Box 5.4).
Consumption reductions, both voluntary and policy-induced, 
can have positive and double-dividend effects on efficiency as 
well as reductions in energy and materials use (Mulder et al. 
2006; Harriss and Shui 2010; Figge et  al. 2014; Grinde 
et al. 2018; Spangenberg and Lorek 2019; Vita et al. 2020). Less 
waste, better emissions control and more effective carbon policies lead 
to better governance and stronger democracies. Systems-dynamics 
models linking strong emissions-reducing policies and strong social 
equity policies show that a low-carbon transition in conjunction with 
social sustainability is possible, even without economic growth (Kallis 
et al. 2012; Jackson and Victor 2016; Stuart et al. 2017; Chapman and 
Fraser 2019; D’Alessandro et al. 2019; Gabriel and Bond 2019; Huang 
et al. 2019; Victor 2019). Such degrowth pathways may be crucial in 
combining technical feasibility of mitigation with social development 
goals (Hickel et al. 2021; Keyßer and Lenzen 2021).
Multi-level or polycentric governance can enhance well-being and 
improve climate governance and social resilience, due to varying 
adaptive, flexible policy interventions at different times and scales 
(Kern and Bulkeley 2009; Lidskog and Elander 2009; Amundsen 
et al. 2010; Keskitalo 2010; Lee and Koski 2015; Jokinen et al. 2016; 
Lepeley 2017; Marquardt 2017; Di Gregorio et al. 2019). Institutional 
transformation may also result from socio-ecological stresses that 
accompany climate change, leading to more effective governance 
structures (David Tàbara et  al. 2018; Patterson and Huitema 2019; 
Barnes et  al. 2020). An appropriate, context-specific mix of options 
facilitated by policies can deliver both higher well-being and reduced 
disparity in access to basic needs for services concurrently with climate 
mitigation (Thomas and Twyman 2005; Mearns and Norton 2009; 
2017). Hence, nurturing equitable human well-being through provision 
of decent living standards for all goes hand in hand with climate change 
mitigation (ISSC et al. 2016; OECD 2019a). There is high confidence in 
the literature that addressing inequities in income, wealth, and DLS not 
only raises overall well-being and furthers the SDGs but also improves 
the effectiveness of climate change mitigation policies.
Participatory governance involves understanding and 
engagement with policies, including climate policies. Greater 
public participation in climate policy processes and governance, by 
increasing the diversity of ideas and stakeholders, builds resilience 
and allows broader societal transformation towards systemic change, 
even in complex, dynamic and contested contexts (Dombrowski 2010; 
Wise et al. 2014; Haque et al. 2015; Jodoin et al. 2015; Mitchell 2015; 
Kaiser 2020; Alegria 2021). This sometimes involves complex policy 
discussions that can lead to governance innovations, also influencing 
social norms (Martinez 2020). A specific example are citizen assemblies, 
deliberating public policy challenges, such as climate change (Devaney 
et al. 2020). Activist climate movements are changing policies as well as 
normative values (Section 5.4 and the Social Science Primer, Chapter 5 
Supplementary Material I). Environmental justice and climate justice 
activists worldwide have called attention to the links between economic 
and environmental inequities, collected and publicised data about 
them, and demanded stronger mitigation (Goodman 2009; Schlosberg 
and Collins 2014; Jafry 2019; Cheon 2020). Youth climate activists, and 
Indigenous leaders, are also exerting growing political influence towards 
mitigation (Helferty and Clarke 2009; White 2011; Powless 2012; 
Petheram et al. 2015; UN 2015; Curnow and Gross 2016; Grady-Benson 
and Sarathy 2016; Claeys and Delgado Pugley 2017; O’Brien et al. 2018; 
Rowlands and Gomez Peña 2019; Bergmann and Ossewaarde 2020; 
Han and Ahn 2020; Nkrumah 2021). Indigenous resurgence (activism 
fuelled by ongoing colonial social and environmental injustices, land 
claims, and deep spiritual and cultural commitment to environmental protection) not only strengthens climate leadership in many countries, 
but also changes broad social norms by raising knowledge of 
Indigenous governance systems which supported sustainable lifeways 
over thousands of years (Wildcat 2014; Chanza and De Wit 2016; 
Whyte 2017; Whyte 2018, Temper et al. 2020). Related trends include 
recognition of the value of traditional ecological knowledge, Indigenous 
governance principles, decentralisation, and appropriate technologies 
(Lange et al. 2007; Goldthau 2014; Whyte 2017).
Social trust aids policy implementation. More equal societies display 
higher trust, which is a key requirement for successful implementation 
of climate policies (Rothstein and Teorell 2008; Carattini et al. 2015; 
Klenert et al. 2018; Patterson et al. 2018). Inter-personal trust among 
citizens often promotes pro-environment behaviour by influencing 
perceptions (Harring and Jagers 2013), enhancing cooperation, and 
reducing free-riding and opportunistic behaviour (Gür 2020). Individual 
support for carbon taxes and energy innovations falls when collective 
community support is lacking (Bolsen et  al. 2014; Smith and Mayer 
2018; Simon 2020). Social trust has a  positive influence on civic 
engagement among local communities, NGOs, and self-help groups for 
local clean cooking fuel installation (Nayak et al. 2015).
Section  5.6 includes examples of climate mitigation policies and 
policy packages which address the interrelationships shown in 
Figure 5.5. Improving well-being for all through climate mitigation 
includes emissions-reduction goals in policy packages that ensure 
equitable outcomes, prioritise social trust-building, support wide 
public participation in climate action including within the informal 
sector, and facilitate institutional change for effective multi-level 
governance, as integral components of climate strategies. This 
strategic approach, and its feasibility of success, rely on complex 
contextual factors that may differ widely, especially between the 
Global North and Global South (Atteridge et al. 2012; Patterson et al. 
2018; Jewell and Cherp 2020; Singh et al. 2020; Singh et al. 2021).
Box 5.4 | Gender, Race, Intersectionality and Climate Mitigation
There is high evidence and high agreement that empowering women benefits both mitigation and adaptation, because women 
prioritise climate change in their voting, purchasing, community leadership, and work, both professionally and at home (high evidence, 
high agreement). Increasing voice and agency for those marginalised in intersectional ways by indigeneity, race, ethnicity, dis/ability, 
and other factors has positive effects for climate policy (high evidence, high agreement).
Climate change affects people differently along all measures of difference and identity, which have intersectional impacts linked to 
economic vulnerability and marginalisation (Morello Frosch et al. 2009; Dankelman 2010; Habtezion 2013; Godfrey and Torres 2016; 
Walsh 2016; Flatø et al. 2017; Goodrich et al. 2019; Perkins 2019; Gür 2020). Worldwide, racialised and Indigenous people bear the 
brunt of environmental and climate injustices through geographic location in extraction and energy ‘sacrifice zones’, areas most 
impacted by extreme weather events, and/or through inequitable energy access (Aubrey 2019; Jafry 2019; Gonzalez 2020; Lacey-
Barnacle et al. 2020; Porter et al. 2020; Temper et al. 2020) Disparities in climate change vulnerability not only reflect pre-existing 
inequalities, they also reinforce them. For example, inequities in income and in the ownership and control of household assets, 
familial responsibilities due to male out-migration, declining food and water access, and increased disaster exposure can undermine 
women’s ability to achieve economic independence, enhance human capital, and maintain physical and mental health and well-being 
(Chandra et al. 2017; Eastin 2018; Das et al. 2019). Studies during the COVID-19 crisis have found that, in general, women’s economic 
and productive lives have been affected disproportionately to men’s (Alon et al. 2020; ILO 2020). Women have less access to social 
protections and their capacity to absorb economic shocks is very low, so they face a ‘triple burden’ during crises – including those
resulting from climate change – and this is heightened for women in the less-developed countries and for those who are intersectionally 
vulnerable (Coates et al. 2020; McLaren et al. 2020; Wenham et al. 2020; Azong and Kelso 2021; Erwin et al. 2021; Maobe and Atela 
2021; Nicoson 2021; Sultana 2021; Versey 2021). Because men currently hold the majority of energy-sector jobs, energy transition 
will impact them economically and psychologically; benefits, burdens and opportunities on both the demand and supply sides of the 
mitigation transition have a range of equity implications (Pearl-Martinez and Stephens 2017; Standal et al. 2020; Mang-Benza 2021). 
Mitigating gendered climate impacts requires addressing inequitable power relations throughout society (Wester and Lama 2019).
Women’s well-being and gender-responsive climate policy have been emphasised in international agreements including the Paris Agreement 
(UNFCCC 2015), Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women General Recommendation 37 (Vijeyarasa 
2021), and the 2016 Decision 21/CP .22 on Gender and Climate Change (UNFCCC 2016; Larson et al. 2018). Increasing the participation 
of women and marginalised social groups, and addressing their special needs, helps to meet a range of SDGs, improve disaster and crisis 
response, increase social trust, and improve climate mitigation policy development and implementation (Alber 2009; Whyte 2014; Elnakat 
and Gomez 2015; Salehi et al. 2015; Buckingham and Kulcur 2017; Cohen 2017; Kronsell 2017; Lee and Zusman 2019).
Women have a key role in the changing energy economy due to their demand for and end use of energy resources in socially-gendered 
productive roles in food production and processing, health, care, education, clothing purchases and maintenance, commerce, and 
other work, both within and beyond the home (Räty and Carlsson-Kanyama 2009; Oparaocha and Dutta 2011; Bob and Babugura 
2014; Macgregor 2014; Perez et al. 2015; Bradshaw 2018; Clancy and Feenstra 2019; Clancy et al. 2019; Fortnam et al. 2019; Rao 
et al. 2019a; Quandt 2019; Horen Greenford et al. 2020; Johnson 2020). Women’s work and decision-making are central in the food 
chain and agricultural output in most developing countries, and in household management everywhere. Emissions from cooking fuels 
can cause serious health damage, and unsustainable extraction of biofuels can also hurt mitigation (Bailis et al. 2015), so considering 
health, biodiversity and climate tradeoffs and co-benefits is important (Rosenthal et al. 2018; Aberilla et al. 2020; Mazorra et al. 2020). 
Policies on energy use and consumption are often focused on technical issues related to energy supply, thereby overlooking demand-
side factors such as household decision-making, unpaid work, livelihoods and care (Himmelweit 2002; Perch 2011; Fumo 2014; Hans 
et al. 2019; Huyer and Partey 2020). Such gender-blindness represents the manifestation of wider issues related to political ideology, 
culture and tradition (Carr and Thompson 2014; Thoyre 2020; Perez et al. 2015; Fortnam et al. 2019).
Women, and all those who are economically and/or politically marginalised, often have less access to energy and use less, not just 
because they may be poorer but case studies show because their consumption choices are more ecologically inclined and their energy 
use is more efficient (Lee et al. 2013; Permana et al. 2015; Li et al. 2019). Women’s carbon footprints are about 6–28% lower than 
men’s (with high variation across countries), mostly based on their lower meat consumption and lower vehicle use (Isenhour and 
Ardenfors 2009; Räty and Carlsson-Kanyama 2009; Räty and Carlsson-Kanyama 2010; Barnett et al. 2012; Medina and Toledo-Bruno 
2016; Ahmad et al. 2017; Fernström Nåtby and Rönnerfalk 2018; Li et al. 2019). Gender-based income redistribution in the form of pay 
equity for women could reduce emissions if the redistribution is revenue neutral (Terry 2009; Dengler and Strunk 2018). Also, advances 
in female education and reproductive health, especially voluntary family planning, can contribute greatly to reducing world population 
growth (Abel et al. 2016; Dodson et al. 2020).
Carbon emissions are lower per capita in countries where women have more political ‘voice’, controlling for GDP per capita and a range of 
other factors (Ergas and York 2012). While most people recognise that climate change is happening (Lewis et al. 2018; Ballew et al. 2019), 
climate denialism is more prevalent among men (McCright and Dunlap 2011; Anshelm and Hultman 2014; Nagel 2015; Jylhä et al. 2016), 
while women are more likely to be environmental activists, and to support stronger environmental and climate policies (Stein 2004; 
McCright and Xiao 2014, Whyte 2014). Racialised groups are more likely to be concerned about climate change and to take political 
action to support climate mitigation policies (Leiserowitz and Akerlof 2010; Godfrey and Torres 2016; Schuldt and Pearson 2016; Pearson 
et al. 2017; Ballew et al. 2020; Johnson 2020). This underscores the important synergies between equity and mitigation. The contributions 
of women, racialised people, and indigenous people, who are socially positioned as those first and most affected by climate change – and 
therefore experts on appropriate climate responses – are substantial (Dankelman and Jansen 2010; Wickramasinghe 2015; Black 2016; 
Vinyeta et al. 2016; Pearse 2017). Equitable power, participation, and agency in climate policymaking is hence an effective contribution for 
improving governance and decision-making on climate change mitigation (Reckien et al. 2017; Collins 2019). Indigenous knowledge is an 
important source of guidance for biodiversity conservation, impact assessment, governance, disaster preparedness and resilience (Salick 
and Ross 2009; Green and Raygorodetsky 2010; Speranza et al. 2010; Mekuriaw Bizuneh 2013; Mekuriaw 2017), and women are often 
the local educators, passing on and utilising traditional and indigenous knowledge (Ketlhoilwe 2013; Onyige 2017; Azong et al. 2018).
Higher female political participation, controlled for other factors, leads to higher stringency in climate policies, and results in lower 
GHG emissions (Cook et al. 2019). Gender equity is also correlated with lower per capita CO 2-eq emissions (Ergas and York 2012).
Reducing global energy demand and resource inputs while improving 
well-being for all requires an identification of options, services and 
pathways that do not compromise essentials of a  decent living. To 
identify such a solution space, this section summarises socio-cultural, 
technological and infrastructural interventions through the Avoid-
Shift-Improve concept. ASI (Section  5.1) provides a  categorisation 
of options aimed at continuously eliminating waste in the current 
systems of service provision (Section 5.3.1.1). It also concisely presents 
demand-side options to reduce GHG emissions by individual choices 
which can be leveraged by supporting policies, technologies and 
infrastructure. Two key concepts for evaluating the efficiency of service 
provision systems are: resource cascades and exergy. These concepts 
provide powerful analytical lenses through which to identify and 
substantially reduce energy and resource waste in service provision 
systems, both for decent living standards (Section 5.3.2) and higher 
well-being levels. They typically focus on end-use conversion and 
service delivery improvements as the most influential opportunities 
for system-wide waste reductions. Review of the state of modelling 
low energy and resource demand pathways in long-term climate 
mitigation scenarios (recognising the importance of such scenarios for 
illuminating technology and policy pathways for more efficient service 
provision) and summary of the mitigation potentials estimated from 
relevant scenarios to date are in Section 5.3.3. Finally, it reviews the 
role of three megatrends that are transforming delivery of services 
in innovative ways  – digitalisation, the sharing economy, and the 
circular economy (Section 5.3.4). The review of megatrends makes an 
assessment highlighting the potential risks of rebound effects, and 
even accelerated consumption; it also scopes for proactive and vigilant 
policies to harness their potential for future energy and resource 
demand reductions, and, conversely, avoiding undesirable outcomes.
5.3.1 Efficient Service Provision
This section organises demand reductions under the ASI framework. 
It presents service-oriented demand-side solutions consistent with 
decent living standards (Creutzig et al. 2018) (Table 5.1). The sharing 
economy, digitalisation, and the circular economy can all contribute to ASI strategies, with the circular economy tentatively more on the 
supply side, and the sharing economy and digitalisation tentatively 
more on the demand side (Section 5.3.4). These new service delivery 
models go beyond sectoral boundaries (IPCC sector chapter boundaries 
are explained in Chapter  12) and take advantage of technological 
innovations, design concepts, and innovative forms of  cooperation, 
cutting across sectors to contribute to systemic changes worldwide. 
Some of these changes can be realised in the short term, such as 
energy access, while others may take a longer period, such as radical 
and systemic eco-innovations like shared electric autonomous vehicles. 
It is important to understand benefits and distributional impacts of 
these systemic changes.
5.3.1.1 Integration of Service Provision Solutions 
with Avoid-Shift-Improve Framework
Assessment of service-related mitigation options within the ASI 
framework is aided by decomposition of emissions intensities into 
explanatory contributing factors, which depend on the type of 
service delivered. Table 5.1 shows ASI options in selected sectors and 
services. It summarises resource, energy, and emissions intensities 
commonly used by type of service (Cuenot et  al. 2010; Lucon et  al. 
2014; Fischedick et al. 2014). Also relevant are the concepts of service 
provision adequacy (Arrow et al. 2004; Samadi et al. 2017), establishing 
the extents to which consumption levels exceed (e.g.,  high-calorie 
diets contributing to health issues (Roy et  al. 2012); excessive food 
waste) or fall short (e.g., malnourishment) of service level sufficiency 
(e.g.,  recommended calories) (Millward-Hopkins et  al. 2020); and 
service level efficiency (e.g., effect of occupancy on the energy intensity 
of public transit passenger-km travelled (Schäfer and Yeh 2020). 
Service-oriented solutions are discussed in Table 5.1. Implementation 
of these solutions requires combinations of institutional, infrastructural, 
behavioural, socio-cultural, and business changes which are mentioned 
in Section 5.2 and discussed in Section 5.4.
Opportunities for avoiding waste associated with the provision of 
services, or avoiding overprovision of or excess demand for services, 
exist across multiple service categories. ‘Avoid’ options are relevant 
in all end-use sectors, namely, teleworking and avoiding long-haul 
flights, adjusting dwelling size to household size, and avoiding short-Box 5.4 (continued)
In societies where women have more economic equity, their votes push political decision-making in the direction of environmental 
and sustainable development policies, less high-emission militarisation, and more emphasis on equity and social policies such as via 
wealth and capital gains taxes (Ergas and York 2012; Resurrección 2013; UNEP 2013; Glemarec et al. 2016; Bryan et al. 2018; Crawford 
2019). Changing social norms on race and climate are linked and policy-relevant (Benegal 2018; Elias et al. 2018; Slocum 2018; Gach 
2019; Wallace-Wells 2019; Temple 2020; Drolet 2021). For all these reasons, climate policies are strengthened by including more 
differently-situated knowledge and diverse perspectives, such as feminist expertise in the study of power (Bell et al. 2020; Lieu et al. 
2020); clarifying equity goals (e.g., distinguishing among ‘reach, ‘benefit’, and ‘empowerment’; obtaining disaggregated data and 
using clear empirical equity measures; and confronting deeply-ingrained inequities in society (Lau et al. 2021). Inclusivity in climate 
governance spans mitigation–adaptation, supply–demand and formal–informal sector boundaries in its positive effects (Morello 
Frosch et al. 2009; Dankelman 2010; Bryan and Behrman 2013; Habtezion 2013; Godfrey and Torres 2016; Walsh 2016; Flatø et al. 
2017; Wilson et al. 2018; Goodrich et al. 2019; Perkins 2019; Bell et al. 2020; Gür 2020).
play an additional role. For example, more compact designs and higher 
accessibility reduce travel demand and translate into lower average floor 
space and corresponding heating/cooling and lighting demand, and thus 
reductions of between 5% to 20% of GHG emissions of end-use sectors 
(Creutzig et al. 2021b). Avoidance of food loss and wastage – which 
equalled 8–10% of total anthropogenic GHG emissions from 2010–2016 
(Mbow et al. 2019), while millions suffer from hunger and malnutrition – 
is a  prime example (Chapter  12). A key challenge in meeting global 
nutrition services is therefore to avoid food loss and waste while 
simultaneously raising nutrition levels to equitable standards globally. 
Literature results indicate that in developed economies, consumers are 
the largest source of food waste, and that behavioural changes such as 
meal planning, use of leftovers, and avoidance of over-preparation can 
be important service-oriented solutions (Gunders et al. 2017; Schanes 
et al. 2018), while improvements to expiration labels by regulators would 
reduce unnecessary disposal of unexpired items (Wilson et al. 2017) and 
improved preservation in supply chains would reduce spoilage (Duncan 
and Gulbahar 2019). Around 931 million tonnes of food waste was 
generated in 2019 globally, 61% of which came from households, 26% 
from food service and 13% from retail.Demand-side mitigations are achieved through changing Socio-
cultural factors, Infrastructure use and Technology adoption by various 
social actors in urban and other settlements, food choice and waste 
management (high confidence) (Figure  5.7). In all sectors, end-use 
strategies can help reduce the majority of emissions, ranging from 
28.7% (4.4 GtCO 2) emission reductions in the industry sector, to 44.2% 
(8.0 GtCO 2-eq)  in the food sector, to 66.75% (4.6 GtCO 2) emission 
reductions in the land transport sector, and 66% (6.8  GtCO 2) in the 
buildings sector. These numbers are median estimates and represent 
benchmark accounting. Estimates are approximations, as they are 
simple products of individual assessments for each of the three options 
listed above. If interactions were taken into account, the full mitigation 
potentials may be higher or lower, independent of relevant barriers 
to realising the median potential estimates. See more in Chapter  5 
Supplementary Material II, Table 5.SM.2.
The technical mitigation potential of food loss and waste reductions 
globally has been estimated at 0.1–5.8 GtCO 2-eq (high confidence) 
(Poore and Nemecek 2018; Smith, et al. 2019) (Section 7.4.5, Figure 5.7 
and Table 12.3). Coupling food waste reductions with dietary shifts 
can further reduce energy, land, and resource demand in upstream Table 5.1 | Avoid-Shift-Improve options in selected sectors and services.  Many options, such as urban form and infrastructures, are systemic, and influence several 
sectors simultaneously. Linkages to concepts presented in sectoral chapters are indicated in parentheses in the first column. Source: adapted from Creutzig at al. (2018).

The estimated technical potential for GHG emissions reductions 
associated with shifts to sustainable healthy diets is 0.5–8 GtCO 2-eq 
(high confidence) (Smith et al. 2013; Jarmul et al. 2020; Creutzig et al. 
2021b) (Figure 5.7, Table 12.2). Current literature on health, diets, and 
emissions indicates that sustainable food systems providing healthy 
diets for all are within reach but require significant cross-sectoral 
action, including improved agricultural practices, dietary shifts among 
consumers, and food waste reductions in production, distribution, 
retail, and consumption (Erb et al. 2016; Muller et al. 2017; Graça et al. 
2019; Willett and al. 2019) (Table 12.9).
Reduced food waste and dietary shifts have highly relevant 
repercussions in the land-use sector that underpin the high GHG 
emission reduction potential. Demand-side measures lead to 
changes in consumption of land-based resources and can save GHG 
emissions by reducing or improving management of residues  or 
making land areas available for other uses such as afforestation 
or bioenergy production (Smith et  al. 2013; Hoegh-Guldberg et  al. 
2019). Deforestation is the second-largest source of anthropogenic 
greenhouse gas emissions, caused mainly by expanding forestry and 
agriculture, and in many cases this agricultural expansion is driven 
by trade demand for food. For example, across the tropics, cattle and 
oilseed products account for half the deforestation carbon emissions, 
embodied in international trade to China and Europe (Creutzig 
et al. 2019a; Pendrill et al. 2019). Benefits from shifts in diets and 
resulting lowered land pressure are also reflected in reductions of 
land degradation and emissions.
Increased demand for biomass can increase the pressure on forest 
and conservation areas (Cowie et al. 2013) and poses a heightened 
risk for biodiversity, livelihoods, and intertemporal carbon balances 
(Lamb et  al. 2016; Creutzig et  al. 2021c), requiring policy and 
regulations to ensure sustainable forest management, which 
depends on forest type, region, climate, and ownership. This suggests 
that demand-side actions hold sustainability advantages over the 
intensive use of bioenergy and BECCS, but also enable land use for 
bioenergy by saving agricultural land for food.
In the transport sector, ASI opportunities exist at multiple levels, 
comprehensively summarised in Bongardt et  al. (2013), Sims 
et  al. (2014), and Roy et  al. (2021) (Chapter  10). Modelling based 
on a  plethora of bottom-up insights and options reveals that 
a  balanced portfolio of ASI policies brings global transport sector 
emissions in line with global warming of not more than 1.5°C (Gota 
et  al. 2019). For example, telework may be a  significant lever for 
avoiding road transport associated with daily commutes, achievable 
through digitalisation, but its savings depend heavily on the modes, 
distances, and types of office use avoided (Hook et  al. 2020) and 
whether additional travel is induced due to greater available time 
(Mokhtarian 2002) or vehicle use by other household members (Kim 
et al. 2015; de Abreu e Silva and Melo 2018). More robustly, avoiding 
kilometres travelled through improved urban planning and smart 
logistical systems can lead to fuel, and, hence, emissions savings 
(Creutzig et  al. 2015a; IEA 2016; IEA 2017a; Wiedenhofer et  al. 
2018), or through avoiding long-haul flights (IEA 2021). For example, 
reallocating road and parking space to exclusive public transit lanes, protected bike lanes and pedestrian priority streets can reduce 
vehicle kilometres travelled in urban areas (ITF 2021). At the vehicle 
level, lightweighting strategies (Fischedick et al. 2014) and avoiding 
inputs of carbon-intensive materials into vehicle manufacturing can 
also lead to significant emissions savings through improved fuel 
economy (Das et al. 2016; Hertwich et al. 2019; IEA 2019b).
Figure 5.7 shows socio-cultural factors can contribute up to 15% to land 
transport GHG emissions reduction by 2050, with 5% as our central 
estimate. Active mobility, such as walking and cycling, has 2–10% 
potential in GHG emissions reduction. Well designed teleworking 
policies can reduce transport-related GHG emissions by at least 1%. 
A  systematic review demonstrates that 26 of 39  studies identified 
suggest that teleworking reduces energy use, induced mainly by distance 
travelled, and only eight studies suggest that teleworking increases or 
has a neutral impact on energy use (Hook et al. 2020). Infrastructure 
use (specifically urban planning and shared pooled mobility) has about 
20–50% (on average) potential in land transport GHG emissions 
reduction, especially via redirecting the ongoing design of existing 
infrastructures in developing countries, and with 30% as our central 
estimate (Section  5.3.4.2). Technology adoption, particularly banning 
combustion and diesel engines and 100% EV targets (and other zero-
carbon fuels, especially in freight) and efficient lightweight cars, can 
contribute to between 30% and 70% of GHG emissions reduction from 
land transport in 2050, with 50% as our central estimate (see Chapter 5 
Supplementary Material II, Table 5.SM.2 and Chapter 10, Sections 10.4 
and 10.7), consistent with scenario modelling (Figure  10.27) and 
based on rapid reduction in the GHG emission footprint of vehicle 
production. These numbers are consistent with the end of fossil fuel-
based new cars in 2035 in major economies and of 100% of vehicles 
being zero-emission vehicles in 2050. Other economies that display 
vehicles obtained on second hand markets may phase out fossil fuel 
cars only after 2050, hence limiting the overall mitigation potential of 
electric vehicles to well below 100% in 2050. Higher energy use and 
CO2-footprint in BEV production compared to ICE production are to 
be met with more rapid decarbonisation of the industry sector and by 
the reduced need for overall vehicle stock, due to socio-cultural and 
infrastructure measures. Ehrenberger et  al. (2021) shows that the 
development of technologies, fleets, and their use are decisive factors in 
reducing the use of fossil energies, resulting in 26–65% CO 2 emissions 
reduction potential until 2040 for the case of Germany. Electric vehicles 
can be used to provide new shared services. In this case, reductions of 
CO2 emissions of close to 20% can be obtained in a scenario where 
20% of car trips and all bus feeder trips are replaced, but considerably 
higher reductions are possible when shared pooled mobility replaces 
private vehicle trips in urban areas (ITF 2017b, ITF 2017d). A study 
shows that ICE vehicles reduce CO 2 emissions to 60% or 80% of 
current emissions levels by 2050 (Hill et al. 2019). Similarly, the power 
grid decarbonisation is assumed to improve to either 50% or 80% over 
current rates, with 80% being the expected decarbonisation and 50% 
a  more conservative estimate. Each possibility for EV adoption rate, 
ICE efficiency improvement, and power decarbonisation is combined 
(Hill et al. 2019). Beyond consuming less energy, EVs enable greater 
use of low-carbon and renewable energy sources than is possible for 
conventional petroleum-based fuels. These technical advantages lead 
to the potential for greatly reducing petroleum use, air pollution and 
carbon emissions. International collaboration could better leverage 
design and use, and end-use technology adoption by 2050.

Figure 5.7 | Demand-side mitigation options and indicative potentials.  Demand-side mitigation response options related to demand for services have been categorised 
into three broad domains: ‘socio-cultural factors’, associated with individual choices, behaviour and lifestyle change, social norms and culture; ‘infrastructure use’, related to 
the design and use of supporting hard and soft infrastructure that enables changes in individual choices and behaviour; and ‘end-use technology adoption’, which refers to the 
uptake of technologies by end users. Demand-side mitigation is a central element of the IMP-LD and IMP-SP scenarios (Section 3.3). Food (nutrition) demand-side potentials 
in 2050 assessment is based on bottom-up studies and estimated following the 2050 baseline for the food sector presented in peer-reviewed literature (more information in 
Chapter 5 Supplementary Material II and Chapter 7, Section 7.4.5). Industry (manufactured products), land transport, aviation and shipping (mobility), and buildings (shelter) 
assessment of potentials for total emissions in 2050 are estimated based on approximately 500 bottom-up studies representing all global regions (detailed list is in Table 5.
SM.2). Baseline is provided by the sectoral mean GHG emissions in 2050 of the two scenarios consistent with policies announced by national governments until 2020. The 
heights of the coloured columns represent the potentials represented by the median value. These are based on a range of values available in the case studies from literature 
shown in Chapter 5 Supplementary Material II. The range is shown by the dots connected by dotted lines representing the highest and the lowest potentials reported in the 
literature. The demand-side potential of socio-cultural factors in food has two parts.The median value of direct emissions (mostly non-CO 2) reduction through socio-cultural 
factors is 1.9 GtCO 2-eq without considering land-use change through reforestation of freed up land. If changes in land-use patterns enabled by this change in food demand 
are considered, the indicative potential could reach 7 GtCO 2-eq. The ‘electricity’ panel presents how sectoral demand-side mitigation options (industry, transport and buildings) 
can change demand on the electricity distribution system. Electricity accounts for an increasing proportion of final energy demand in 2050 (‘additional electrification’ bar) 
in line with multiple bottom-up studies (detailed list is in Table 5.SM.3) and Chapter 6 (Section 6.6). These studies are used to compute the impact of end-use electrification 
which increases overall electricity demand. Some of the projected increase in electricity demand can be avoided through demand-side mitigation options in the domains of 
socio-cultural factors and infrastructure use strategies in end-use electricity use in buildings, industry and land transport found in literature based on bottom-up assessments 
(Section 5.3 and Chapter 5 Supplementary Material II).
of a zero-emission vehicle deployment target and an electric mobility 
target for 2035 would help in establishing a common long-term global 
electric-drive vision (Lutsey 2015).
Socio-cultural factors such as avoiding long-haul flights and shifting 
to train wherever possible can contribute between 10% and 40% 
to aviation GHG emissions reduction by 2050 (Figure 5.7). Maritime 
transport (shipping) emits around 940 MtCO 2 annually and is 
responsible for about 2.5% of global GHG emissions (IMO 2020). 
Technology measures and management measures, such as slow 
steaming, weather routing, contra-rotating propellers, and propulsion 
efficiency devices can deliver more fuel savings between 1% and 
40% than the investment required (Bouman et al. 2017) (Chapter 5, 
Supplementary Material II, Table 5.SM.2).
In the buildings sector, avoidance strategies can occur at the end 
use or individual building operation level. End-use technologies and 
strategies such as the use of daylighting (Bodart and De Herde 2002) 
and lighting sensors can avoid demand for lumens from artificial 
light, while passive houses, thermal mass, and smart controllers can 
avoid demand for space conditioning services. Eliminating standby 
power losses can avoid energy wasted for no useful service in many 
appliances and devices, which may reduce household electricity use 
by up to 10% (Roy et al. 2012). At the building level, smaller dwellings 
can reduce overall demand for lighting and space conditioning 
services, while smaller dwellings, shared housing, and building lifespan 
extension can all reduce the overall demand for carbon-intensive 
building materials such as concrete and steel (Material Economics 
2018; Hertwich et al. 2019; IEA 2019b; Pauliuk et al. 2021). Emerging 
strategies for materials efficiency, such as 3D printing to optimise the 
geometries and minimise the materials content of structural elements, 
may also play a key role if thermal performance and circularity can be 
improved (Mahadevan et al. 2020; Adaloudis and Bonnin Roca 2021). 
Several scenarios estimate an ‘Avoid’ potential in the building sector, 
which includes reducing waste in superfluous floor space, heating and 
IT equipment, and energy use, of between 10% and 30%, in one case 
even by 50% (Nadel and Ungar 2019) (Chapter 9).
Socio-cultural factors and behavioural and social practices in energy 
saving, like adaptive heating and cooling by changing temperature, 
can contribute about 15% to GHG emissions reduction in the buildings 
sector by 2050 (Figure  5.7). Infrastructure use such as compact city 
and  urban planning interventions, living floor space rationalisation, 
and access to low-carbon architectural design has about 20% potential 
in building sector GHG emissions reduction. Technology adoption, 
particularly access to energy efficient technologies, and installation of 
renewable energy technologies can contribute between 30% and 70% 
to GHG emissions reduction in the buildings sector (Chapters 8 and 9 
and Chapter 5 Supplementary Material II, Table 5.SM.2).
Service efficiency strategies are emerging to avoid materials demand 
at the product level, including dematerialisation strategies for various 
forms of packaging (Worrell and Van Sluisveld 2013) and the concept 
of ‘products as services’, in which product systems are designed and 
maintained for long lifespans to provide a marketable service (Oliva 
and Kallenberg 2003), thereby reducing the number of products sold and tonnes of materials needed to provide the same service to 
consumers, consistent with circular economy and materials efficiency 
principles (Chapter 11). Successful examples of this approach have 
been documented for carpets (Stubbs and Cocklin 2008), copiers 
(Roy 2000), kitchens (Liedtke et al. 1998), vehicles (Williams 2006; 
Ceschin and Vezzoli 2010) and more (Roy 2000).
‘Shift’ strategies unique to the service-oriented perspective generally 
involve meeting service demands at much lower lifecycle energy, 
emissions, and resource intensities (Roy and Pal 2009), through such 
strategies as shifting from single-family to multi-family dwellings 
(reducing the materials intensity per unit floor area (Ochsendorf et al. 
2011)), shifting from passenger cars to rail or bus (reducing fuel, 
vehicle manufacturing, and infrastructure requirements (Chester and 
Horvath 2009)), shifting materials to reduce resource and emissions 
intensities (e.g., low-carbon concrete blends (Scrivener and Gartner 
2018)) and shifting from conventional to additive manufacturing 
processes to reduce materials requirements and improve end-use 
product performance (Huang et al. 2016, 2017).
An important consideration in all ASI strategies is the potential for 
unintended rebound effects (Sorrell et al. 2009; Brockway et al. 2021) 
as indicated in Figures 5.8, 5.12, and 5.13a, which must be carefully 
avoided through various regulatory and behavioural measures 
(Santarius et  al. 2016). In many developing country contexts, 
rebound effects can help in accelerated provision of  affordable 
access to modern energy and a minimum level of per capita energy 
consumption (Saunders et  al. 2021; Chakravarty and Roy 2021). 
Extending the lifespan of energy inefficient products may lead to net 
increases in emissions (Gutowski et al. 2011), whereas automated 
car sharing may reduce the number of cars manufactured at the 
expense of increased demand for passenger kilometres due to lower 
travel opportunity cost (Wadud et al. 2016) (Section 5.3.2).
Avoiding short lifespan products in favour of products with longer 
lifespan as a socio-cultural factor; and infrastructure use measures such 
as increasing the re-usability and recyclability of products’ components 
and materials, and adopting materials-efficient services and CO2-
neutral materials, have about 29% indicative potential by 2050. 
(Chapter 11 and Chapter 5 Supplementary Material II, Table 5.SM.2).
In summary, sector-specific demand-side mitigation options reflect the 
important role of socio-cultural, technological and infrastructural factors 
and the interdependence among them (Figure 5.7). The assessment in 
Figure 5.7 shows that by 2050 high emission reduction potential can be 
realised with demand-side actions alone, which can be complementary 
to supply-side interventions, with considerable impact by reducing the 
need for capacity addition on the electricity supply system. Integrated 
cross-sectoral actions shown through sector coupling is also important 
for investment decision-making and policy framing going beyond 
sector boundaries (high evidence and high agreement).
5.3.1.2 Household Consumption Options 
to Reduce GHG Emissions
A systematic review of options to reduce the GHG emissions 
associated with household consumption activities identified 
aggregated into 61  consumption option categories (Ivanova et  al. 
2020) (Figure 5.8). Consistently with previous research (Herendeen 
and Tanaka 1976; Pachauri and Spreng 2002; Pachauri 2007; Ivanova 
et  al. 2016), a  hierarchical list of mitigation options emerges. 
Choosing low-carbon options, such as car-free living, plant-based diets with no or very little animal products, low-carbon sources of 
electricity and heating at home, as well as local holiday plans, can 
reduce an individual’s carbon footprint by up to 9 tCO 2-eq. Realising 
these options requires substantial policy support to overcome 
infrastructural, institutional and socio-cultural lock-in (Sections 5.4 
and 5.6).

Service delivery systems to satisfy a  variety of service needs 
(e.g., mobility, nutrition, thermal comfort, etc.) comprise a series of 
interlinked processes to convert primary resources (e.g., coal, minerals) into useable products (e.g.,  electricity, copper wires, lamps, light 
bulbs). It is useful to differentiate between conversion and processing 
steps ‘upstream’ of end users (mines, power plants, manufacturing 
facilities) and ‘downstream’, that is, those associated with end-users, 
including service levels, and direct well-being benefits for people (Kalt 
et al. 2019). Illustrative examples of such resource processing systems

shown in Figure 5.9, in the form of resource processing cascades for 
energy (direct energy conversion efficiencies (Nakićenović et al. 1993; 
De Stercke 2014)), water use in food production systems (water use 
efficiency and embodied water losses in food delivery and consumption 
(Lundqvist et al. 2008; Sadras et al. 2011)), and materials (Ayres and 
Simonis 1994; Fischer-Kowalski et al. 2011), using the example of steel 
manufacturing, use and recycling at the global level (Allwood and 
Cullen 2012). Invariably, conversion losses along the entire service 
delivery systems are substantial, ranging from 83% (water) to 86% 
(energy) and 87% (steel) of primary resource inputs (TWI2050 2018). 
In other words, only between 14 to 17% of the harnessed primary 
resources remain at the level of ultimate service delivery.Examples of conversion losses on the supply side of resource processing 
systems include, for instance: for energy, electricity generation (global 
output/input conversion efficiency of electric plants of 45% as shown 
in energy balance statistics (IEA 2020b)); for water embodied in food, 
irrigation water use efficiency (some 40% (Sadras et al. 2011)) and 
calorific conversion efficiency (food calories in to food calories out) 
in meat production of 60% (Lundqvist et al. 2008), or for materials, 
globally only 47% of primary iron ore extracted and recovered steel 
scrap end up as steel in purchased products, (i.e.,  a  loss of 57%) 
(Allwood and Cullen 2012).
A substantial part of losses happens at the end-use point and in final 
service delivery (where losses account for 47% to 60% of aggregate 
systems losses for steel and energy respectively, and 23% in the case 
of water embodied in food). The efficiency of service delivery (Brand-
Correa and Steinberger 2017) has usually both a  technological 
component (efficiency of end-use devices such as cars, light bulbs) 
and a behavioural component (i.e., how efficiently end-use devices 
are used, e.g.,  load factors) (Dietz et  al. 2009; Laitner et  al. 2009; 
Norton 2012; Kane and Srinivas 2014; Ehrhardt-Martinez 2015; 
Thaler 2015; Lopes et al. 2017). Using the example of mobility, where 
service levels are usually expressed by passenger-km, service delivery 
efficiency is thus a function of the fuel efficiency of the vehicle and 
its drivetrain (typically only about 20%–25% for internal combustion 
engines, but close to 100% for electric motors) plus how many 
passengers the vehicle actually transports (load factor, typically as 
low as 20–25%, i.e. one passenger per vehicle that could seat four 
to five), that is, an aggregate end-use efficiency of between 4–6% 
only. Aggregated energy end-use efficiencies at the global level are 
estimated as low as 20% (De Stercke 2014), 13% for steel (recovered 
post-use scrap) (Allwood and Cullen 2012), and some 70% for 
food (including distribution losses and food waste of some 30%) 
(Lundqvist et al. 2008).
To harness additional gains in efficiency by shifting the focus in service 
delivery systems to the end user can translate into large upstream 
resource reductions. For each unit of improvement at the end-use point 
of the service delivery system (examples shown in Figure 5.9), primary 
resource inputs are reduced between a factor of 6 to 7 units (water, 
steel, energy) (TWI2050 2018). For example, reducing energy needs 
for final service delivery equivalent to 1 EJ, reduces primary energy 
needs by some 7 EJ. There is thus high evidence and high agreement 
in the literature that the leverage effect for improvements in end-
use service delivery efficiency through behavioural, technological, 
and market organisational innovations is very large, ranging from 
a factor 6 to 7 (resource cascades) to up to a factor 10 to 20 (exergy 
analysis), with the highest improvement potentials at the end-user 
and service provisioning levels (for systemic reviews see Nakićenović 
et al. (1996a), Grubler et al. (2012b), and Sousa et al. (2017)). Also, the 
literature shows high agreement that current conversion efficiencies 
are invariably low, particularly for those components at the end-
use and service-delivery back end of service provisioning systems. 
It also suggests that efficiencies might actually be even lower 
than those revealed by direct input-output resource accounting, 
as discussed above (Figure  5.9). Illustrative exergy efficiencies of 
entire national or global service delivery systems range from 2.5% 
(USA (Ayres 1989)) to 5% (OECD average (Grubler  et  al. 2012b))

Figure  5.10 | Realisable energy efficiency improvements by region and 
by end-use type between 2020 and 2050 in an illustrative Low Energy 
Demand scenario (in EJ).  Efficiency improvements are decomposed by respective 
steps in the conversion chain from primary energy to final, and useful, energy, and to 
service delivery, and disaggregated by region (developed and developing countries) 
and end-use type (buildings, transport, materials). Improvements are dominated by 
improved efficiency in service delivery (153 EJ) and by more efficient end-use energy 
conversion (134 EJ). Improvements in service efficiency in transport shown here are 
conservative in this scenario but could be substantially higher with the full adoption 
of integrated urban shared mobility schemes. Increases in energy use due to increases 
in service levels and system effects of transport electrification (grey bars on top of first 
pair in the bar charts) that counterbalance some of the efficiency improvements are 
also shown. Examples of options for efficiency improvements and decision involved 
(grey text in the chart), the relative weight of generic demand-side strategies (Avoid-
Shift-Improve blue arrows), as well as prototype actors involved, are also illustrated.

restricted systems boundaries, either leaving out upstream resource 
processing/conversion or conversely end-use and service provision, 
show typical exergetic efficiencies between 15% (city of Geneva 
(Grubler et al. 2012a)) to below 25% (Japan, Italy, and Brazil, albeit 
with incomplete systems coverage that miss important conversion 
losses (Nakićenović et al. 1996b)). These findings are confirmed by 
more recent exergy efficiency studies that also include longitudinal 
time trend analysis (Cullen and Allwood 2010; Brockway et al. 2014; 
Serrenho et  al. 2014; Brockway et  al. 2015; Guevara et  al. 2016). 
Figure 5.10 illustrates how energy demand reductions can be realised 
by improving the resource efficiency cascades shown in Figure 5.9.
5.3.3 Low Demand Scenarios
Long-term mitigation scenarios play a crucial role in climate policy 
design in the near term, by illuminating transition pathways, 
interactions between supply-side and demand-side interventions, 
their timing, and the scales of required investments needed to 
achieve mitigation goals (Chapter  3). Historically, most long-term 
mitigation scenarios have taken technology-centric approaches 
with heavy reliance on supply-side solutions and the use of carbon 
dioxide removal, particularly in 1.5°C scenarios (Rogelj et al. 2018). 
Comparatively less attention has been paid to deep demand-side 
reductions incorporating socio-cultural change and the cascade 
effects (Section 5.3.2) associated with ASI strategies, primarily due to 
limited past representation of such service-oriented interventions in 
long-term integrated assessment models (IAMs) and energy systems 
models (ESMs) (Grubler et  al. 2018; van de Ven et  al. 2018; Napp 
et al. 2019). There is ample evidence of savings from sector- or issue-
specific bottom-up studies (Section 5.3.1.2). However, these savings 
typically get lost in the dominant narrative provided by IAMs and 
ESMs and in their aggregate-level evaluations of combinations of ASI 
and efficiency strategies. As a result, their interaction effects do not 
typically get equal focus alongside supply-side and carbon dioxide 
removal options (Samadi et al. 2017; Van Vuuren et al. 2018; Van den 
Berg et al. 2019).
In response to 1.5°C ambitions, and a  growing desire to identify 
participatory pathways with less reliance on carbon dioxide removal 
which has high uncertainty, some recent IAM and ESM mitigation 
scenarios have explored the role of deep demand-side energy and 
resource use reduction potentials at global and regional levels. 
Table 5.2 summarises long-term scenarios that aimed to: minimise 
service-level energy and resource demand as a  central mitigation 
tenet; specifically evaluate the role of behavioural change and ASI 
strategies; and/or achieve a carbon budget with limited or no carbon 
dioxide removal. From assessment of this emerging body of literature, 
several general observations arise and are presented below.
First, socio-cultural changes within transition pathways can offer 
gigatonne-scale CO 2 savings potential at the global level, and 
therefore represent a substantial overlooked strategy in traditional 
mitigation scenarios. Two lifestyle change scenarios conducted 
with the IMAGE IAM suggested that behaviour and cultural 
changes such as heating and cooling set-point adjustments, shorter showers, reduced appliance use, shifts to public transit, less meat-
intensive diets, and improved recycling can deliver an additional 
1.7 Gt and 3 GtCO 2 savings in 2050, beyond the savings achieved 
in traditional technology-centric mitigation scenarios for the 2°C 
and 1.5°C ambitions, respectively (van Sluisveld et  al. 2016; Van 
Vuuren et al. 2018). In its Sustainable Development Scenario, the 
IEA’s behavioural change and resource efficiency wedges deliver 
around 3 GtCO 2-eq reduction in 2050, combined savings, roughly 
equivalent to those of solar PV that same year (IEA 2019a). In 
Europe, a  Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) scenario 
evaluating combined lifestyle changes such as teleworking, travel 
avoidance, dietary shifts, food waste reductions, and recycling 
reduced cumulative EU  27 CO 2 emissions 2011–2050 by up 
to 16% compared to an SSP2 baseline (van de Ven et  al. 2018). 
Also in Europe, a  multi-regional input-output analysis suggested 
that adoption of low-carbon consumption practices could reduce 
carbon footprints by 25%, or 1.4 Gt (Moran et al. 2020). A global 
transport scenario suggests that transport sector emissions can 
decline from business-as-usual 18 GtCO 2-eq to 2 GtCO 2-eq if ASI 
strategies are deployed (Gota et  al. 2019), a  value considerably 
below the estimates provided in IAM scenarios that have limited or 
no resolution in ASI strategies (Chapter 10).
The IEA’s Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) scenario, in which 
behavioural changes lead to 1.7 GtCO 2 savings in 2030, expresses the 
substantial mitigation opportunity in terms of low-carbon technology 
equivalencies: to achieve the same emissions reductions, the global 
share of EVs in the NZE would have to increase from 20% to 45% by 

increase from 440 to 660 million by 2030 (IEA 2021).
In light of the limited number of mitigation scenarios that represent 
socio-behavioural changes explicitly, there is medium evidence in the 
literature that such changes can reduce emissions at regional and global 
levels, but high agreement within that literature that such changes 
hold up to gigatonne-scale CO 2 emissions reduction potentials.
Second, pursuant to the ASI principle, deep demand reductions 
require parallel pursuit of behavioural change and advanced energy-
efficient technology deployment; neither is sufficient on its own. The 
LED scenario (Figure 5.10) combines behavioural and technological 
change consistent with numerous ASI strategies that leverage 
digitalisation, sharing, and circular economy megatrends to deliver 
decent living standards while reducing global final energy demand 
in 2050 to 245 EJ (Grubler et  al. 2018). This value is 40% lower 
than final energy demand in 2018 (IEA 2019a), and a lower 2050 
outcome than other IAM/ESM scenarios with primarily technology-
centric mitigation approaches (Teske et al. 2015; IEA 2017b). In the 
IEA’s B2DS scenario, Avoid/Shift in the transport sector accounts 
for around 2 GtCO 2-eq yr –1 in 2060, whereas parallel vehicle 
efficiency improvements increase the overall mitigation wedge to 
5.5 GtCO 2-eq yr –1 in 2060 (IEA 2017b). Through a combination of 
behavioural change and energy-efficient technology adoption, the 
IEA’s NZE requires only 340 EJ of global final energy demand with 
universal energy access in 2050, which is among the lowest of IPCC 
net zero SR1.5 scenarios (IEA 2021).

additions and the need for carbon capture and removal technologies 
to reach emissions targets. Of the scenarios listed in Table 5.2, one 
(LED-MESSAGE) reaches 2050 emissions targets with no carbon 
capture or removal technologies (Grubler et  al. 2018), whereas 
others report significant reductions in reliance on bioenergy with 
carbon capture and storage (BECCS) compared to traditional 
technology-centric mitigation pathways (Liu et al. 2018; Van Vuuren 
et al. 2018; Napp et al. 2019), with the IEA’s NZE notably requiring 
the least carbon dioxide removal (1.8 Gt in 2050) and primary 
bioenergy (100  EJ in 2050) compared to IPCC net zero SR1.5 
scenarios (IEA 2021).
Fourth, the costs of reaching mitigation targets may be lower when 
incorporating ASI strategies for deep energy and resource demand 
reductions. The TIAM-Grantham low demand scenarios displayed 
reduction in mitigation costs (0.87–2.4% of GDP), while achieving 
even lower cumulative emissions to 2100 (228 to ~475 GtCO 2) 
than its central demand scenario (741 to 1066 GtCO 2), which had 
a cost range of (2.4–4.1% of GDP) (Napp et al. 2019). The GCAM 
behavioural change scenario concluded that domestic emission 
savings would contribute to reducing the costs of achieving the 
internationally agreed climate goal of the EU by 13.5% to 30% (van 
de Ven et al. 2018). The AIMS lifestyle case indicated that mitigation 
costs, expressed as global GDP loss, would be 14% lower than the 
SSP2 reference scenario in 2100, for both 2°C and 1.5°C mitigation 
targets (Liu et  al. 2018). These findings mirror earlier AIM results, 
which indicated lower overall mitigation costs for scenarios focused 
on energy service demand reductions (Fujimori et al. 2014). In the 
IEA’s NZE, behavioural changes that avoid energy and resource 
demand save USD4 trillion (cumulatively 2021–2050) compared to 
if those emissions reductions were achieved through low-carbon 
electricity and hydrogen deployment (IEA 2021).
Based on the limited number of long-term mitigation scenarios that 
explicitly represent demand reductions enabled by ASI strategies, 
there is medium evidence but with high agreement within the 
literature that such scenarios can reduce dependence on supply-side 
capacity additions and carbon capture and removal technologies, 
with opportunites for lower overall mitigation costs.
If the limitations within most IAMs and ESMs regarding non-inclusion 
of granular ASI strategy analysis can be addressed, it will expand 
and improve long-term mitigation scenarios (Van den Berg et  al. 
2019). These include broader inclusion of mitigation costs for 
behavioural interventions (van Sluisveld et al. 2016), much greater 
incorporation of rebound effects (Krey et al. 2019), including from 
improved efficiencies (Brockway et al. 2021) and avoided spending 
(van de Ven et al. 2018), improved representation of materials cycles 
to assess resource cascades (Pauliuk et al. 2017), broader coverage 
of behavioural change (Samadi et  al. 2017; Saujot et  al. 2020), 
improved consideration of how economic development affects 
service demand (Semieniuk et al. 2021), explicit representation of 
intersectoral linkages related to digitalisation, sharing economy, 
and circular economy strategies (Section  5.3.4), and institutional, 
political, social, entrepreneurial, and cultural factors (van Sluisveld 
et al. 2018). Addressing the current significant modelling limitations will require increased investments in data generation and 
collection, model development, and inter-model comparisons, with 
a  particular focus on socio-behavioural research, which has been 
underrepresented in mitigation research funding to date (Overland 
and Sovacool 2020).
COVID-19 interacts with demand-side scenarios (Box 5.2). Energy 
demand will mostly likely be reduced between 2020 and 2030 
compared to the default pathway, and if recovery is steered 
towards low energy demand, carbon prices for a 1.5°C-consistent 
pathway will be reduced by 19%, energy supply investments until 

upscale renewable energy technologies will be softened (Kikstra 
et al. 2021a).
5.3.4 Transformative Megatrends
The sharing economy, the circular economy, and digitalisation have 
all received much attention from the research, advocacy, business 
models and policy communities as potentially transformative trends 
for climate change mitigation (IEA 2017a; Material Economics 2018; 
TWI2050 2019). All are essentially emerging and contested concepts 
(Gallie 1955) that have the common goal of increasing convenience 
for users and rendering economic systems more resource efficient, 
but which exhibit variability in the literature on their definitions and 
system boundaries. Historically, both sharing and circular economies 
have been commonplace in developing countries, where reuse, repair, 
and waste scavenging and recycling comprise the core of informal 
economies facilitated by human interventions (Wilson et  al. 2006; 
Asim et al. 2012; Pacheco et al. 2012). Digitalisation is now propelling 
sharing and circular economy concepts in developed and developing 
countries alike (Roy et al. 2021), and the three megatrends are highly 
interrelated, as seen in Figure  5.11. For example, many sharing 
economy concepts rely on corporate or, to lesser degree, non-profit 
digital platforms that enable efficient information and opportunity 
sharing, thus making it part of the digitalisation trend. Parts of 
the sharing economy are also included in some circular economy 
approaches, as shared resource use renders utilisation of material 
more efficient. Digital approaches to material management also 
support the circular economy, such as through waste exchanges 
and industrial symbiosis. Digitalisation aims more broadly to deliver 
services in more efficient, timely, intelligent, and less resource-
intensive ways (i.e., by moving bits and not atoms), through the use 
of increasingly interconnected physical and digital systems in many 
facets of economies. With rising digitalisation also comes the risk of 
increased electricity use to power billions of devices and the internet 
infrastructure that connects them, as well as growing quantities of 
e-waste, presenting an important policy agenda for monitoring and 
balancing the carbon and resource costs and benefits of digitalisation 
(Malmodin and Lundén 2018; TWI2050 2019). Rebound effects 
and instigated consumption of digitalisation are risking to lead to 
a  net increase in GHG emissions (Belkhir and Elmeligi 2018). The 
determinants and possible scales of mitigation potentials associated 
with each megatrend are discussed below.
In the context of service provision, there are numerous opportunities 
for consumers to buy, subscribe to, adopt, access, install or use 
digital goods and services (Wilson et al. 2020b). Digitalisation has 
opened up new possibilities across all domains of consumer activity, 
from travel and retail to domestic living and energy use. Digital 
platforms allow surplus resources to be identified, offered, shared, 
transacted and exchanged (Frenken 2017). Real-time information 
flows on consumers’ preferences and needs mean service provision 
can be personalised, differentiated, automated, and optimised 
(TWI2050 2019). Rapid innovation cycles and software upgrades 
drive continual improvements in performance and responsiveness 
to consumer behaviour. These characteristics of digitalisation enable 
new business models and services that affect both service demand, 
from shared ride-hailing (ITF 2017a) to smart heating (IEA 2017a), 
and how services are provisioned, from online farmers’ markets 
(Richards and Hamilton 2018) to peer-to-peer electricity trading to 
enable distributed power systems (Morstyn et al. 2018).
In many cases, digitalisation provides a ‘radical functionality’ that 
enables users to do or accomplish something that they could not 
do before (Nagy et al. 2016). Indeed the consumer appeal of digital 
innovations varies widely, from choice, convenience, flexibility and 
control to relational and social benefits (Pettifor and Wilson 2020). Reviewing over 30 digital goods and services for mobility, food 
buying and domestic living, Wilson et al. (2020b) also found shared 
elements of appeal across multiple innovations including (i) making 
use of surplus, (ii) using not owning, (iii) being part of wider 
networks, and (iv) exerting greater control over service provisioning 
systems. Digitalisation thus creates a  strong value proposition 
for certain consumer niches. Concurrent diffusion of many digital 
innovations amplifies their disruptive potential (Schuelke-Leech 
2018; Wilson et al. 2019b). Besides basic mobile telephone service 
for communication, digital innovations have been primarily geared to 
population groups with high purchasing power, and too little to the 
needs of poor and vulnerable people.
The long-term sustainability implications of digitalised services hinge 
on four factors: (i) the direct energy demands of connected devices 
and the digital infrastructures (i.e., data centres and communication 
networks) that provide necessary computing, storage, and 
communication services (Section 9.4.6); (ii) the systems-level energy 
and resource efficiencies that may be gained through the provision 
of digital services (Wilson et al. 2020b); (iii) the resource, material, 
and waste management requirements of the billions of ICT devices 
that comprise the world’s digital systems (Belkhir and Elmeligi 2018; 
Malmodin and Lundén 2018) and (iv) the magnitude of potential 
rebound effects or induced energy demands that might unleash 
unintended and unsustainable demand growth, such as autonomous Past Present EmergingPersonal  comput ers

Figure 5.11 | The growing nexus between digitalisation, the sharing economy, and the circular economy in service delivery systems.  While these trends 
started mostly independently, rapid digitalisation is creating new synergistic opportunities with systemic potential to improve the quality of jobs, particularly in developing 
economies. Widespread digitalisation may lead to net increases in electricity use, demand for electronics manufacturing resources, and e-waste, all of which must be monitored 
and managed via targeted policies.
reduced travel costs (Wadud et al. 2016). Estimating digitalisation’s 
direct energy demand has historically been hampered by lack of 
consistent global data on IT device stocks, their power consumption 
characteristics, and usage patterns, for both consumer devices and the 
data centres and communication networks behind them. As a result, 
quantitative estimates vary widely, with literature values suggesting 
that consumer devices, data centres, and data networks account for 
anywhere from 6% to 12% of global electricity use (Gelenbe and 
Caseau 2015; Cook et  al. 2017; Malmodin and Lundén 2018). For 
example, within the literature on data centres, top-down models that 
project energy use on the basis of increasing demand for internet 
services tend to predict rapid global energy use growth, (Andrae and 
Edler 2015; Belkhir and Elmeligi 2018; Liu et  al. 2020a), whereas 
bottom-up models that consider data centre technology stocks and 
their energy efficiency trends tend to predict slower but still positive 
growth (Shehabi et  al. 2018; Hintemann and Hinterholzer 2019; Malmodin 2020; Masanet et al. 2020). Yet there is growing concern 
that remaining energy efficiency improvements might be outpaced 
by rising demand for digital services, particularly as data-intensive 
technologies such as artificial intelligence, smart and connected 
energy systems, distributed manufacturing systems, and autonomous 
vehicles promise to increase demand for data services even further in 
the future (TWI2050 2019; Masanet et al. 2020; Strubell et al. 2020). 
Rapid digitalisation is also contributing to an expanding e-waste 
problem, estimated to be the fastest growing domestic waste stream 
globally (Forti et al. 2020).
As digitalisation proliferates, an important policy objective is 
therefore to invest in data collection and monitoring systems and 
energy demand models of digitalised systems to guide technology 
and policy investment decisions for addressing potential direct 
energy demand growth (IEA 2017a) and potentially concomitant 
growth in e-waste.

Figure 5.12 | Studies assessing net changes in CO 2 emissions, energy use, and activity levels indicate mitigation potentials for numerous end-user-
oriented digitalisation solutions, but also risk of increased emissions due to inefficient substitutions, induced demand, and rebound effects.  90 studies 
were assessed with 207 observations (indicated by vertical bars) including those based on empirical research, attributional and consequential lifecycle assessments, and techno-
economic analyses and scenarios at different scales, which are not directly comparable but are useful for indicating the directionality and determinants of net emissions, energy, 
and activity effects. Sources: Erdmann and Hilty (2010); Gebler et al. (2014); Huang et al. (2016); Verhoef et al. (2018); Alhumayani et al. (2020); Court and Sorrell (2020); Hook 
et al. (2020); IEA (2020a); Saade et al. (2020); Torres-Carrillo et al. (2020); Wilson et al. (2020c); Yao et al. (2020); Muñoz et al. (2021).
gained through the provision of digital services could play 
an important role in dealing with climate change and other 
environmental challenges (Masanet and Matthews 2010; Melville 
2010; Elliot 2011; Watson et  al. 2012; Gholami et  al. 2013; Añón 
Higón et  al. 2017). As shown in Figure  5.12, assessments of 
numerous digital service opportunities for mobility, nutrition, 
shelter, and education and entertainment suggest that net emissions 
benefits can be delivered at the systems level, although these effects 
are highly context dependent. Importantly, evidence of potential 
negative outcomes due to rebound effects, induced demand, or life-
cycle trade-offs can also be observed. For example, telework has 
been shown to reduce emissions where long and/or energy-intensive 
commutes are avoided, but can lead to net emissions increases in 
cases where greater non-work vehicle use occurs or only short, low-
emissions commutes (e.g., via public transit) are avoided (Hook et al. 
2020; IEA 2020a; Viana Cerqueira et al. 2020). Similarly, substitution 
of physical media by digital alternatives may lead to emissions 
increases where greater consumption is fuelled, whereas a  shift 
to 3D printed structures may require more emissions-intensive 
concrete formulations or result in reduced thermal energy efficiency, 
leading to life-cycle emissions increases (Mahadevan et  al. 2020; 
Yao et al. 2020).
Furthermore, digitalisation, automation and artificial intelligence, 
as general-purpose technologies, may lead to a  plethora of new 
products and applications that are likely to be efficient on their own 
but that may also lead to undesirable changes or absolute increases 
in demand for products (Figure 5.12). For example, last-mile delivery 
in logistics is both expensive and cumbersome. Battery-powered 
drones enable a delivery of goods at similar lifecycle emissions to 
delivery vans (Stolaroff et al. 2018). At the same time, drone delivery 
is cheaper in terms of time (immediate delivery) and monetary costs 
(automation saves the highest-cost component: personnel) (Sudbury 
and Hutchinson 2016). As a  result, demand for package delivery 
may increase rapidly. Similarly, automated vehicles reduce the costs 
of time, parking, and personnel, and therefore may dramatically 
increase vehicle mileage (Wadud et al. 2016; Cohen and Cavoli 2019). 
On-demand electric scooters offer mobility access preferable to 
passenger cars, but can replace trips otherwise taken on public transit 
(de Bortoli and Christoforou 2020) and can come with significant 
additional energy requirements for night-time system rebalancing 
(Hollingsworth et  al. 2019; ITF 2020). The energy requirements of 
cryptocurrencies is also a  growing concern, although considerable 
uncertainty exists surrounding the energy use of their underlying 
blockchain infrastructure (Vranken 2017; de Vries 2018; Stoll et al. 
2019). For example, while it is clear that the energy requirements 
of global Bitcoin mining have grown significantly since 2017, recent 
literature indicates a wide range of estimates for 2020 (47 TWh to 

(Lei et al. 2021). Initial estimates of the computational intensity of 
artificial intelligence algorithms suggest that energy requirements 
may be enormous without concerted effort to improve efficiencies, 
especially on the computational side (Strubell et al. 2020). Efficiency 
gains enabled by digitalisation, in terms of reduced GHG emissions 
or energy use per service unit, may be overcompensated by activity/
scale effects.Maximising the mitigation potential of digitalisation trends 
involves diligent monitoring and proactive management of both 
direct and indirect demand effects, to ensure that a proper balance 
is maintained. Direct energy demand can be managed through 
continued investments in, and incentives for, energy-efficient data 
centres, networks, and end-use devices (Masanet et  al. 2011; 
Avgerinou et al. 2017; IEA 2017a; Koronen et al. 2020). Shifts to low-
carbon power are a particularly important strategy being undertaken 
by data centre and network operators (Cook et al. 2014; Huang et al. 
2020), which might be adopted across the digital device spectrum 
as a  proactive mitigation strategy where data demands outpace 
hardware efficiency gains, which may be approaching limits in the 
near future (Koomey et  al. 2011). Most recently, data centres are 
being investigated as a  potential resource for demand response 
and load balancing in renewable power grids (Koronen et al. 2020; 
Zheng et al. 2020), while a large bandwidth for improving software 
efficiency has been suggested for overcoming slowing hardware 
efficiency gains (Leiserson et al. 2020). Ensuring efficiency benefits of 
digital services while avoiding potential rebound effects and demand 
surges will require early and proactive public policies to avoid excess 
energy use (TWI2050 2019; WBGU 2019), which will also necessitate 
investments in data collection and monitoring systems to ensure that 
net mitigation benefits are realised and that unintended consequences 
can be identified early and properly managed (IEA 2017a).
Within a small but growing body of literature on the net effects of 
digitalisation, there is medium evidence that digitalised consumer 
services can reduce overall emissions, energy use, and activity levels, 
with medium agreement on the scale of potential savings, with the 
important caveat that induced demand and rebound effects must be 
managed carefully to avoid negative outcomes.
5.3.4.2 The Sharing Economy
Opportunities to increase service per  product include peer-to-peer 
based sharing of goods and services such as housing, mobility, and 
tools. Hence, consumable products become durable goods delivering 
a ‘product service’, which potentially could provide the same level 
of service with fewer products (Fischedick et al. 2014).The sharing 
economy is an old practice of sharing assets between many without 
transferring ownership, which has been made new through focuses 
on sharing underutilised products and assets in ways that promote 
flexibility and convenience, often in a highly developed context via 
gig economy or online platforms. However, the sharing economy 
offers the potential to shift from ‘asset-heavy’ ownership to ‘asset-
light’ access, especially in developing countries (Retamal 2019). 
General conclusions on the sharing economy as a  framework for 
climate change mitigation are challenging and are better broken 
down to specific subsystems (Mi and Coffman 2019) (Chapter  5 
Supplementary Material I, 5.SM.4.3).
Shared mobility
Shared mobility is characterised by the sharing of an asset 
(e.g.,  a  bicycle, e-scooter, vehicle), and the use of technology 
(i.e.,  apps and the Internet) to connect users and providers. It 
succeeded by identifying market inefficiencies and transferring 
shared mobility providers operate privately, their services can be 
considered as part of a  public transport system in so far as it is 
accessible to most transport users and does not require private 
asset ownership. Shared mobility reduces GHG emissions if it 
substitutes for more GHG-intensive travel (usually private car 
travel) (Martin and Shaheen 2011; Shaheen and Chan 2016; Santos 
2018; Axsen  and Sovacool 2019; Shaheen and  Cohen 2019), and 
especially if it changes consumer behaviour in the long run ‘by 
shifting personal transportation choices from ownership to demand-
fulfilment’ (Mi and Coffman 2019).
Demand is an important driver for energy use and emissions because 
decreased cost of travel time by sharing an asset (e.g., a vehicle) could 
lead to an increase in emissions, but a high level of vehicle sharing 
could reduce negative impacts associated with this (Brown and 
Dodder 2019). One example is the megacity Kolkata, India, which 
has as many as twelve different modes of public transportation 
that co-exist and offer means of mobility to its 14 million citizens 
(Box 5.8). Most public transport modes are shared mobility options 
ranging from sharing between two people in a rickshaw or between 
a  few hundred in metro or suburban trains. Sharing also happens 
informally as daily commuters avail shared taxis and neighbours 
borrow each other’s car or bicycle for urgent or day trips.
Shared mobility using private vehicle assets is categorised into four 
models (Santos 2018): peer-to-peer platforms where individuals can 
rent the vehicle when not in use (Ballús-Armet et al. 2014); short-
term rental managed and owned by a  provider (Enoch and Taylor 
2006; Schaefers et  al. 2016; Bardhi and Eckhardt 2012); Uber-like 
ridehailing services (Wallsten 2015; Angrist et  al. 2017); and ride 
pooling using private vehicles shared by passengers to a common 
destination (Liyanage et  al. 2019; Shaheen and Cohen 2019). The 
latest model  – ride pooling  – is promising in terms of congestion 
and per capita CO 2 emissions reductions and is a common practice 
in developing countries, however it is challenging in terms of waiting 
and travel time, comfort, and convenience, relative to private cars 
(Santos 2018; Shaheen and Cohen 2019). The other three models 
often yield profits to private parties, but remain mostly unrelated 
to reduction in CO 2 emissions (Santos 2018). Shared travel models, 
especially Uber-like models, are criticised because of the flexibilisation 
of labour, especially in developing countries, in which unemployment 
rates and unregulated labour markets lay a foundation of precarity 
that lead many workers to seek out wide-ranging means towards 
patching together a  living (Ettlinger 2017; Wells et  al. 2020). 
Despite the advantages of shared mobility, such as convenience and 
affordability, consumers may also perceive risk formed by possible 
physical injury from strangers or unexpected poor service quality 
(Hong et al. 2019).
From a mitigation perspective, the current state of shared mobility 
looks at best questionable (Fishman et al. 2014; Ricci 2015; Martin 
2016; Zhang and Mi 2018; Creutzig et al. 2019b; Mi and Coffman 
2019; Zhang et al. 2019). Transport entrepreneurs and government 
officials often conflate ‘smart’ and ‘shared’ vehicles with 
‘sustainable’ mobility, a conflation not withstanding scrutiny (Noy 
and Givoni 2018). Surveys demonstrate that many users take free-floating car sharing instead of public transit, rather than to 
replace their private car (Herrmann et al. 2014); while in the United 
States, ride-hailing and sharing data indicate that these services 
have increased road congestion and lowered transit ridership, with 
an insignificant change in vehicle ownership, and may further lead to 
net increases in energy use and CO 2 emissions due to deadheading 
(Diao et  al. 2021; Ward et  al. 2021). If substitution effects and 
deadheading, which is the practice of allowing employees of 
a common carrier to use a vehicle as a non-revenue passenger, are 
accounted for, flexible motor-cycle sharing in Djakarta, Indonesia, 
is at best neutral to overall GHG emissions (Suatmadi et al. 2019). 
Passenger surveys conducted in Denver, Colorado, US, indicated 
that around 22% of all trips travelled with Uber and Lyft would 
have been travelled by transit, 12% would have walked or biked, 
and another 12% of passengers would not have travelled at all 
(Henao and Marshall 2019).
Positive effects can be realised directly in bike sharing due to its 
very low marginal transport emissions. For example, in 2016, bike 
sharing in Shanghai, China, reduced CO 2 emissions by 25 ktCO 2, with 
additional benefits to air quality (Zhang and Mi 2018). However, 
bike-sharing can also increase emissions from motor vehicle usage 
when inventory management is not optimised during maintenance, 
collection, and redistribution of dock-less bikes (Fishman et al. 2014; 
Zhang et al. 2019; Mi and Coffman 2019).
Shared mobility scenarios demonstrate that GHG emission reduction 
can be substantial when mobility systems and digitalisation are 
regulated. One study modelled that ride pooling with electric cars 
(6 to 16 seats), which shifts the service to a more efficient transport 
mode, improves its carbon intensity by cutting GHG emissions by 
one-third (International Transport Forum 2016). Another study found 
that shared autonomous taxis had the potential to reduce per-mile 
GHG emissions to 63–82% below those of projected hybrid vehicles 
in 2030, 87% to 94% lower than a  privately owned, gasoline-
powered vehicle in 2014 (Greenblatt and Saxena 2015). This also 
realises 95% reduction in space required for public parking; and 
total vehicle kilometres travelled would be 37% lower than the 
present day, although each vehicle would travel ten times the total 
distance of current vehicles (International Transport Forum 2016). 
Studies of Berlin, Germany, and Lisbon, Portugal, demonstrate that 
sharing strategies could reduce the number of cars by more than 
90%, also saving valuable street space for human-scale activity 
(Bischoff and Maciejewski 2016; Martinez and Viegas 2017; 
Creutzig et al. 2019b). The impacts will depend on sharing levels – 
concurrent or sequential – and the future modal split among public 
transit, automated electric vehicles fleets, and shared or pooled 
rides. Evidence from attributional lifecycle assessments (LCAs) of 
ride-hailing, whether Uber-like or by taxi, suggests that the key 
determinants of net emissions effects are average vehicle occupancy 
and vehicle powertrain, with high-occupancy and electric drivetrain 
cars delivering the greatest emissions benefits, even rivalling 
traditional metro/urban rail and bus options (Figure  5.13b). It is 
possible that shared automated electric vehicle fleets could become 
widely used without many shared rides, and single- or even zero-
occupant vehicles will continue to be the majority of vehicle trips. 
It is also feasible that shared rides could become more common, 
effective, and more convenient, increasing total travel substantially 
(Wadud et  al. 2016). Car sharing with automated vehicles could 
even worsen congestion and emissions by generating additional 
travel demand (Rubin et  al. 2016). Travel time in autonomous 
vehicles can be used for other activities but driving and travel costs 
are expected to decrease, which most likely will induce additional 
demand for auto travel (Moeckel and Lewis 2017) and could even 
create incentives for further urban sprawl. More generally, increased 
efficiency generated by big data and smart algorithms may generate 
rebound effects in demand and potentially compromise the public 
benefits of their efficiency promise (Gossart 2015).
In many countries, shared mobility and ride pooling are often the 
norm. Here the challenge is to improve service quality to keep users 
in shared mobility and public transport (Box  5.8). A key barrier in 
cities like Nairobi, Kenya, is the lack of public involvement of users 
and sustainability experts in designing transport systems, leaving 
planning to transport engineers, and thus preventing inclusive shared 
mobility system design (Klopp 2012).
Altogether, travel behaviour, business models, and especially public 
policy will be key components in determining how impacts of 
pooling and shared automated electric vehicles unfold (Shaheen 
and Cohen 2019). Urban-scale governance of smart mobility holds 
potential for prioritising public transit and the use of public spaces 
for human activities, managing the data as a  digital sustainable 
commons (e.g., via the installation of a Central Information Officer, 
as in Tel Aviv, Israel), and managing the social and environmental 
risks of smart mobility to realise its benefits (Creutzig et al. 2019b). 
Pricing of energy use and GHG emissions will be helpful to achieve 
these goals. The governance of shared mobility is complicated, as 
it involves many actors, and is key to realising wider benefits of 
shared mobility (Akyelken et al. 2018). New actors, networks and 
technologies enabling shared mobility are already fundamentally 
challenging how transport is governed worldwide. This is not 
a debate about state versus non-state actors but instead about the 
role the state takes within these new networks to steer, facilitate, 
and also reject different elements of the mobility system (Docherty 
et al. 2018).
Shared accommodation
In developing countries and in many student accommodations 
globally, shared accommodation allows affordable housing for 
a large part of the population. For example, living arrangements are 
built expressly around the practice of sharing toilets, bathrooms and 
kitchens. While the sharing of such facilities does connote a lower 
level of service provision and quality of life, it provides access 
for a  consumer base with very low and unreliable incomes. Thus, 
sharing key facilities can help guarantee the provision of affordable 
housing (Gulyani et  al. 2018). In developed countries, large-scale 
developments are targeting students and ‘young professionals’ 
by offering shared accommodation and services. Historically 
shared accommodation has been part of the student life due to its 
flexible and affordable characteristics. However, the expansion of 
housing supply through densification can use shared facilities as an instrument to ‘commercialize small housing production, while 
housing affordability and accessibility are threatened’ (Uyttebrouck 
et al. 2020).
With respect to travel accommodation, several models are emerging 
in which accommodation is offered to, or shared with, travellers 
by private individuals organised by business-driven or non-profit 
online platforms. Accommodation sharing includes peer-to-peer, 
ICT-enabled, short-term renting, swapping, borrowing or lending 
of existing privately-owned lodging facilities (Möhlmann 2015; 
Voytenko Palgan et al. 2017).
With shared accommodation services via the platform economy, 
there may be risks of negative sustainability effects, such as rebound 
effects caused by increased travel frequency (Tussyadiah and Pesonen 
2016). This is particularly a problem if apartments are removed from 
long-term rental markets, thus indirectly inducing construction 
activities, with substantial GHG emissions of their own. However, if 
a host shares their accommodation with a guest, the use of some 
resources, such as heating and lighting, is shared, thereby leading to 
more efficient resource use per capita (Chenoweth 2009; Voytenko 
Palgan et al. 2017). Given the nascence of shared accommodation 
via the platform economy, quantifications of its systems-level energy 
and emissions impacts are lacking in the literature, representing an 
important area for future study.
Mitigation potentials of sharing economy strategies
Sharing economy initiatives play a  central role in enabling 
individuals to share underutilised products. While the literature on 
the net effects of sharing economy strategies is still limited, available 
studies have presented different mitigation potentials to date, as 
shown in Figure 5.13. For many sharing economy strategies, there is 
a risk of negative rebound and induced demand effects, which may 
occur by changing consuming patterns, for example if savings from 
sharing housing are used to finance air travel. Thus, the mitigation 
potentials of sharing economy strategies will depend on stringent 
public policy and consumer awareness that reins in runaway 
consumption effects. Shared economy solutions generally relate to 
the ‘Avoid’ and ‘Shift’ strategies (Sections 5.1 and 5.3.2). On the one 
hand, they hold potential for providing similar or improved services 
for well-being (mobility, shelter) at reduced energy and resource 
input, with the proper policy signals and consumer responses. On 
the other hand, shared economy strategies may increase emissions, 
for example shared mobility may shift activity away from public 
transit and lead to lower vehicle occupancy, deadheading, and use 
of inefficient shared vehicles (Jones and Leibowicz 2019; Merlin 
2019; Bonilla-Alicea et  al. 2020; Ward et  al. 2021). Similarly to 
digitalisation, there is medium evidence that the sharing economy 
can reduce overall emissions, energy use, and activity levels, with 
medium agreement on the scale of potential savings if induced 
demand and rebound effects can be carefully managed to avoid 
negative outcomes.
The circular economy
While the demand for energy and materials will increase until 2060 
following the traditional linear model of production and consumption, 
resulting in serious environmental consequences (OECD 2019b), the 
circular economy (CE) provides strategies for reducing societal needs 
for energy and primary materials to deliver the same level of service 
with lower environmental impacts. The CE framework embodies 
multiple schools of thought with roots in a number of related concepts 
(Blomsma and Brennan 2017; Murray et al. 2017), including cradle 
to cradle (McDonough and Braungart 2002), performance economy 
(Stahel 2016), biomimicry (Benyus 1997), green economy (Loiseau 
et al. 2016) and industrial ecology (Saavedra et al. 2018). As a result, there are also many definitions of CE: a systematic literature review 
identified 114 different definitions (Kirchherr et  al. 2017). One of 
the most comprehensive models is suggested by the Netherlands 
Environmental Assessment Agency (Potting et al. 2018), which defines 
ten strategies for circularity: Refuse (R0), Rethink (R1), Reduce (R2), 
Reuse (R3), Repair (R4), Refurbish (R5), Remanufacture  (R6), 
Repurpose (R7), Recycle (R8), and Recover energy (R9). Overall, 
the definition of CE is contested, with varying boundary conditions 
chosen. As illustrated in Figure 5.11, the CE overlaps with both the 
sharing economy and digitalisation megatrends.
In line with the principles of SDG 12 (responsible consumption 
and production), the essence of building a CE is to retain as much

the end of their useful life in a  given application (Lewandowski 
2016; Lieder and Rashid 2016; Stahel 2016; Linder and Williander 
2017). This requires an integrated approach during the design 
phase that, for example, extends product usage and ensures 
recyclability after use (de Coninck et  al. 2018). While traditional 
‘Improve’ strategies tend to focus on direct energy and carbon 
efficiency, service-oriented strategies focus on reducing lifecycle 
emissions through harnessing the leverage effect (Creutzig et  al. 
2018). The development of closed-loop models in service-oriented 
businesses can increase resource and energy efficiency, reducing 
emissions and contributing to climate change mitigation goals at 
national, regional, and global levels (Johannsdottir 2014; Korhonen 
et  al. 2018). Key examples include remanufacturing of consumer 
products to extend lifespans while maintaining adequate service 
levels (Klausner et  al. 1998), reuse of building components to 
reduce demand for primary materials and construction processes 
(Shanks et al. 2019), and improved recycling to reduce upstream 
resource pressures (IEA 2019b; IEA 2017b).
Among the many schools of thought on the CE and climate change 
mitigation, two different trends can be distinguished from the 
literature to date. First, there are publications, many of them not peer-
reviewed, that eulogise the perceived benefits of the CE, but in many 
cases stop short of providing a quantitative assessment. Promotion 
of CE from this perspective has been criticised as a greenwashing 
attempt by industry to avoid serious regulation (Isenhour 2019). 
Second, there are more methodologically rigorous publications, 
mostly originating in the industrial ecology field, but sometimes 
investigating only limited aspects of the CE (Bocken et al. 2017; Cullen 
2017; Goldberg 2017). Conclusions on CE’s mitigation potential 
also differ, with diverging definitions of the CE. A systematic review 
identified 3,244 peer-reviewed articles addressing CE and climate 
change, but only 10% of those provide insights on how the CE can 
support mitigation, and most of them found only small potentials 
to reduce GHG emissions (Cantzler et al. 2020). Recycling is the CE 
category most investigated, while reuse and reduce strategies have 
seen comparatively less attention (Cantzler et  al. 2020). However, 
mitigation potentials were also context- and material-specific, as 
illustrated by the ranges shown in Figure 5.13a.
There are three key concerns relating to the effectiveness of the 
CE concept. First, many proposals on the CE insufficiently reflect 
on thermodynamic constraints that limit the potential of recycling 
from both mass conservation and material quality perspectives or 
ignore the considerable amount of energy needed to reuse materials 
(Cullen 2017). Second, demand for materials and resources will likely 
outpace efficiency gains in supply chains, becoming a key driver of 
GHG emissions and other environmental problems, rendering the 
CE alone an insufficient strategy to reduce emissions (Bengtsson 
et  al. 2018). In fact, the empirical literature points out that only 
6.5% of all processed materials (4 Gt yr –1) globally originate from 
recycled sources (Haas et  al. 2015). The low degree of circularity 
is explained by the high proportion of processed materials (44%) 
used to provide energy, thus not available for recycling; and the 
high rate of net additions to stocks of 17 Gt yr –1. As long as long-
lived material stocks (e.g., in buildings and infrastructure) continue to grow, strategies targeting end-of-pipe materials cannot keep 
pace with primary materials demand (Krausmann et  al. 2017; 
Haas et al. 2020). Instead, a significant reduction of societal stock 
growth, and decisive eco-design, are suggested to advance the CE 
(Haas et al. 2015). Third, cost-effectiveness underlying CE activities 
may concurrently also increase energy intensity and reduce labour 
intensity, causing systematically undesirable effects. To a  large 
extent, the distribution of costs and benefits of material and 
energy use depend on institutions in order to include demand-side 
solutions. Thus, institutional conditions have an essential role to 
play in setting rules differentiating profitable from nonprofitable 
activities in CE (Moreau et al. 2017). Moreover, the prevalence of 
CE practices such as reuse, refurbishment, and recycling can differ 
substantially between developed and developing economies, 
leading to highly context-specific mitigation potentials and policy 
approaches (McDowall et al. 2017).
One report estimates that the CE can contribute to more than 

material substitution in buildings (Blok et al. 2016). Reform of the tax 
system towards GHG emissions and the extraction of raw materials 
substituting taxes on labour is a key precondition to achieve such 
a  potential. Otherwise, rebound effects tend to take back a  high 
share of marginal CE efforts. A 50% reduction of GHG emissions 
in industrial processes, including the production of goods in steel, 
cement, plastic, paper, and aluminium, from 2010 until 2050, is 
impossible to attain only with reuse and radical product innovation 
strategies, but will need to also rely on the reduction of primary input 
(Allwood et al. 2010).
CE strategies generally correspond to the ‘Avoid’ strategy for 
primary materials (Sections 5.1 and 5.3.2). CE strategies in industrial 
settings improve well-being mostly indirectly, via the reduction of 
environmental harm and climate impact. They can also save monetary 
resources of consumers by reducing the need for consumption. It may 
seem counterintuitive, but reducing consumers’ need to consume 
a particular product or service (e.g., reducing energy consumption) 
may increase consumption of another product or service (e.g., travel) 
associated with some type of energy use, or lead to greater 
consumption if additional secondary markets are created. Hence, 
carbon emissions could rise if the rebound effect is not considered 
(Chitnis et al. 2013; Zink and Geyer 2017).
Looking at ‘Shift’ strategies (Sections 5.1 and 5.3.2), the role of 
individuals as consumers and users has received less attention than 
other aspects of the CE (e.g., technological interventions as ‘Improve’ 
strategies and waste minimisation as ‘Avoid’ strategies) within 
mainstream debates to date. One explanation is that CE has roots 
in the field of industrial ecology, which has historically emphasised 
materials systems more than the end user. By shifting this perspective 
from the supply side to the demand side in the CE, users are, for 
the most part, discussed as social entities that now must form new 
relations with businesses to meet their needs. That is, the demand-
side approach largely replaces the concept of a consumer with that 
of a user, who must either accept or reject new business models for 
service provision, stimulated by the pushes and pulls of prices and 
performance (Hobson 2019).
by the CE will remain out of scope if decision-makers and industry fail 
to reduce primary inputs (high confidence). Systemic (consequential) 
analysis is required to avoid the risk that scaling effects negate 
efficiency gains; such analysis is however rarely applied to date. For 
example, material substitution or refurbishment of buildings brings 
risk of increasing emissions despite improving or avoiding current 
materials (Castro and Pasanen 2019; Eberhardt et al. 2019). Besides, 
CE concepts that extend the lifetime of products and increase the 
fraction of recycling are useful but are both thermodynamically 
limited and will remain relatively small in scale as long as demand 
for primary materials continues to grow, and scale effects dominate. 
In spite of presenting a large body of literature on CE in general, only 
a small but growing body of literature exists on the net effects of its 
strategies from a quantitative perspective, with key knowledge gaps 
remaining on specific CE strategies. There is medium evidence that 
the CE can reduce overall emissions, energy use, and activity levels, 
with medium evidence that the sharing economy can reduce overall 
emissions, energy use, and activity levels, with medium agreement on 
the scale of potential savings.
5.4 Transition Toward High Well-being 
and Low-carbon-demand Societies
Demand-side mitigation involves individuals (e.g.,  consumption 
choices), culture (e.g.,  social norms, values), corporate 
(e.g.,  investments), institutions (e.g.,  political agency), and 
infrastructure change (high evidence, high agreement). These five 
drivers of human behaviour either contribute to the status quo 
of a  global high-carbon, consumption- and GDP growth-oriented 
economy or help generate the desired change to a  low-carbon energy-services, well-being, and equity-oriented economy (Jackson 
2016; Cassiers et  al. 2018; Yuana et  al. 2020; Nielsen et al. 2021) 
(Figure 5.14). Each driver has novel implications for the design and 
implementation of demand-side mitigation policies. They show 
important synergies, making energy demand mitigation a  dynamic 
problem where the packaging and/or sequencing of different policies 
play a role in their effectiveness, demonstrated in Sections 5.5 and 
5.6. The Social Science Primer (Chapter 5 Supplementary Material I) 
describes theory and empirical insights about the interplay between 
individual agency, the social and physical context of demand-side 
decisions in the form of social  roles and norms, infrastructure and 
technological constraints and affordances, and other formal and 
informal institutions. Incremental interventions on all five fronts 
change social practices, affecting simultaneously energy and well-
being (Schot and Kanger 2018). Transformative change will require 
coordinated use of all five drivers, as described in Figure 5.14 and, 
using novel insights about behaviour change for policy design and 
implementation (high evidence,  high agreement). In particular, socio-
economic factors, such as equity, public service quality, electricity 
access and democracy are found to be highly significant in enabling 
need satisfaction at low energy use, whereas economic growth beyond 
moderate incomes and extractive economic activities are observed to 
be prohibiting factors (Vogel et al. 2021).
5.4.1 Behavioural Drivers
Behaviour change by individuals and households requires both 
motivation to change and capacity for change (option availability/
knowledge; material/cognitive resources to initiate and maintain 
change) (Moser and Ekstrom 2010; Michie et al. 2011) and is best 
seen as part of more encompassing collective action. Motivation for 
Demand side mitigation is about more than behavioural change. Reconﬁguring the way services are provided while simultaneously changing social 
norms and preferences will help reduce emissions and access. Transformation happens through societal, technological and institutional changes.

incentives, and regard for deeper intrinsic value of concern for others 
over extrinsic values. Capacity for change varies; people in informal 
settlements or rural areas are incapacitated by socio-political realities 
and have limited access to new energy-service options.
Motivation and effort required for behaviour change increase from 
‘Improve’ to ‘Shift’ to ‘Avoid’ decisions. ‘Improve’ requires changes in 
personal purchase decisions, ‘Shift’ involves changes in behavioural 
routines, ‘Avoid’ also involves changes in deeper values or mindsets. 
People set easy goals for themselves and more difficult ones for 
others (Attari et al. 2016) and underestimate the energy savings of 
behaviour changes that make a large difference (Attari et al. 2010). 
Most personal actions taken so far have small mitigation potential 
(recycling, ecodriving), and people refrain from options advocated 
more recently with high impact (less flying, living car free) (Dubois 
et al. 2019).As individuals pursue a  broad set of goals and use calculation-, 
emotion-, and rule-based processes when they make energy decisions, 
demand-side policies can use a  broad range of behavioural tools 
that complement subsidies, taxes, and regulations (Chakravarty and 
Roy 2016; Mattauch et  al. 2016; Niamir 2019) (high evidence, high 
agreement). The provision of targeted information, social advertisements, 
and influence of trusted in-group members and/role models or admired 
role models like celebrities can be used to create better climate change 
knowledge and awareness (Niamir 2019; Niamir et al. 2020b; Niamir 
et  al. 2020c). Behavioural interventions like communicating changes 
in social norms can accelerate behaviour change by creating tipping 
points (Nyborg et al. 2016). When changes in energy-demand decisions 
(such as switching to a plant-based diet, (Box 5.5)) are motivated by the 
creation and activation of a social identity consistent with this and other 
behaviours, positive spillover can accelerate behaviour change (Truelove 
et al. 2014), both within a domain or across settings, for example from 
work to home (Maki and Rothman 2017).
Box 5.5 | Dietary Shifts in UK Society Towards Lower-emission Foods
Meat eating is declining in the UK, alongside a shift from carbon-intensive red meat towards poultry. This is due to the interaction of 
behavioural, socio-cultural and organisational drivers (Vinnari and Vinnari 2014). Reduced meat consumption is primarily driven by 
issues of personal health and animal welfare, instead of climate or environment concerns (Latvala et al. 2012; Dibb and Fitzpatrick 
2014; Hartmann and Siegrist 2017; Graça et al. 2019). Social movements have promoted shifts to a vegan diet (Morris et al. 2014; 
Laestadius et al. 2016) yet their impact on actual behaviour is the subject of debate (Taufik et al. 2019; Harguess et al. 2020; Sahakian 
et al. 2020). Companies have expanded new markets in non-meat products (MINTEL 2019). Both corporate food actors and new 
entrants offering more innovative ‘meat alternatives’ view consumer preferences as an economic opportunity, and are responding 
by increasing the availability of meat replacement products. No significant policy change has taken place in the UK to enable dietary 
shift (Wellesley and Froggatt 2015); however the Climate Change Committee has recommended dietary shift in the Sixth Carbon 
Budget (Climate Change Committee 2020), involving reduced consumption of high-carbon meat and dairy products by 20% by 
2030, with further reductions in later years in order to reach net zero GHG emissions by 2050. Agricultural policies serve to support 
meat production with large subsidies that lower production cost and effectively increase the meat intensity of diets at a population 
level (Simon 2003; Godfray et al. 2018). Deeper, population-wide reductions in meat consumption are hampered by these lock-in 
mechanisms which continue to stabilise the existing meat production-consumption system. The extent to which policymakers are 
willing to actively stimulate reduced meat consumption thus remains an open question (Godfray et al. 2018). See more in Chapter 5 
Supplementary Material I, Section 5.SM.6.4.
People’s general perceptions of climate risks, first covered in AR5, 
motivate behaviour change; more proximate and personal feelings of 
being at risk triggered by extreme weather and climate-linked natural 
disasters will increase concern and willingness to act (Bergquist et al. 
2019), though the window of increased support is short (Sisco 
et al. 2017). 67% of individuals in 26 countries see climate change as 
a major threat to their country, an increase from 53% in 2013, though 
29% also consider it a minor or no threat (Fagan and Huang 2019). 
Concern that the COVID-19 crisis may derail this momentum due 
to a finite pool of worry (Weber 2006) appears to be unwarranted: 
Americans’ positions on climate change in 2020 matched high levels 
of concern measured in 2019 (Leiserowitz et al. 2020). Younger, female, 
and more educated individuals perceive climate risks to be larger 
(Weber 2016; Fagan and Huang 2019). Moral values and political 
ideology influence climate risk perception and beliefs about the 
outcomes and effectiveness of climate action (Maibach et al. 2011). Motivation for demand-side solutions can be increased by focusing 
on personal health or financial risks and benefits that clearly matter 
to people (Petrovic et al. 2014). Consistent with climate change as 
a normally distant, non-threatening, statistical issue (Gifford 2011; 
Fox-Glassman and Weber 2016), personal experience with climate-
linked flooding or other extreme weather events increases perceptions 
of risk and willingness to act (Weber 2013; Atreya and Ferreira 2015; 
Sisco et  al. 2017) when plausible mediators and moderators are 
considered Brügger et al. (2021), confirmed in all 24 countries studied 
by Broomell et al. (2015). Discounting the future matters (Hershfield 
et al. 2014): across multiple countries, individuals more focused on 
future outcomes are more likely to engage in environmental actions 
(Milfont et al. 2012).
There is medium evidence and high agreement that demographics, 
values, goals, personal and social norms differentially determine 
2009; Niamir 2019; Niamir et al. 2020b), the OECD (Ameli and Brandt 
2015), and 11 European countries (Mills and Schleich 2012; Roy et al. 
2012). Education and income increase ‘Shift’ and ‘Improve’ behaviour, 
whereas personal norms help to increase the more difficult ‘Avoid’ 
behaviours (Mills and Schleich 2012). Socio-demographic variables 
(household size and income) predict energy use, but psychological 
variables (perceived behavioural control, perceived responsibility) 
predict changes in energy use; younger households are more likely 
to adopt ‘Improve’ decisions, whereas education increases ‘Avoid’ decisions (Ahmad et  al. 2015). In India and developing countries, 
‘Avoid’ decisions are made by individuals championing a  cause, 
while ‘Improve’ and ‘Shift’ behaviour are increased by awareness 
programmes and promotional materials highlighting environmental 
and financial benefits (Chakravarty and Roy 2016; Roy et al. 2018a). 
Cleaner cookstove adoption Box  5.6), a  widely studied ‘Improve’ 
solution in developing countries (Nepal et al. 2010; Pant et al. 2014), 
goes up with income, education, and urban location. Female education 
and investments in reproductive health are evident measures to 
reduce world population growth (Abel et al. 2016).
Box 5.6 | Socio-behavioural Aspects of Deploying Cookstoves
Universal access to clean and modern cooking energy could cut premature deaths from household air pollution by two-thirds, while 
reducing forest degradation and deforestation and contributinh to the reduction of up to 50% of CO 2 emissions from cooking (relative 
to baseline by 2030) (IEA 2017c; Dagnachew et al. 2019). However, in the absence of policy reform and substantial energy investments, 
2.3 billion people will have no access to clean cooking fuels such as biogas, LPG, natural gas or electricity in 2030 (IEA 2017c). 
Studies reveal that a combination of drivers influence adoption of new cookstove appliances, including affordability, behavioural and 
cultural aspects (lifestyles, social norms around cooking and dietary practices), information provision, availability, aesthetic qualities 
of the technology, perceived health benefits, and infrastructure (spatial design of households and cooking areas). The increasing 
efficiency improvements in electric cooking technologies could enable households to shift to electrical cooking at mass scale. The use 
of pressure cookers and rice cookers is now widespread in South Asia and beginning to penetrate the African market as consumer 
attitudes are changing towards household appliances with higher energy efficiencies (Batchelor et al. 2019). There are shifts towards 
electric and LPG stoves in Bhutan (Dendup and Arimura 2019), India (Pattanayak et al. 2019), Ecuador (Martínez et al. 2017; Gould 
et al. 2018) and Ethiopia (Tesfamichael et al. 2021); and improved biomass stoves in China (Smith et al. 1993). Significant subsidy, 
information (Dendup and Arimura 2019), social marketing and availability of technology in the local markets are some of the key 
policy instruments helping to adopt improved cookstoves (Pattanayak et al. 2019). There is no one-size-fits-all solution to household 
air pollution – different levels of shift and improvement occur in different cultural contexts, indicating the importance of socio-cultural 
and behavioural aspects in shifts in cooking practices. See more in Chapter 5 Supplementary Material I, Section 5.SM.6.2.
There is high agreement in the literature that the updating of educational 
systems from a commercialised, individualised, entrepreneurial training 
model to an education cognisant of planetary health and human well-
being can accelerate climate change awareness and action (Mendoza 
and Roa 2014; Dombrowski et  al. 2016) (Supplementary Material I 
Chapter 5).
There is high evidence and high agreement that people’s core values 
affect climate-related decisions and climate policy support by shaping 
beliefs and identities (Dietz 2014; Steg 2016; Hayward and Roy 
2019). People with altruistic and biospheric values are more likely to 
act on climate change and support climate policies than those with 
hedonic or egoistic values (Taylor et al. 2014), because these values 
are associated with higher awareness and concern about climate 
change, stronger belief that personal actions can help mitigate 
climate change, and stronger feelings of responsibility for taking 
climate action (Dietz 2014; Steg 2016). Research also suggest that 
egalitarian, individualistic, and hierarchical worldviews (Wildavsky 
and Dake 1990) have their role, and that successful solutions 
require policy-makers of all three worldviews to come together and 
communicate with each other (Chuang et al. 2020).Core values also influence which costs and benefits are considered 
(Hahnel et al. 2015; Gölz and Hahnel 2016; Steg 2016). Information 
provision and appeals are thus more effective when tailored to those 
values (Bolderdijk et al. 2013; Boomsma and Steg 2014), as implemented 
by the energy cultures framework (Stephenson et al. 2015; Klaniecki 
et  al. 2020). Awareness, personal norms, and perceived behavioural 
control predict willingness to change energy-related behaviour above 
and beyond traditional socio-demographic and economic predictors 
(Schwartz 1977; Ajzen 1985; Stern 2000), as do perceptions of self-
efficacy (Bostrom et al. 2019). However, such motivation for change 
is often not enough, as actors also need capacity for change and help 
to overcome individual, institutional and market barriers (Young et al. 
2010; Bray et al. 2011; Carrington et al. 2014).
Table  5.4 describes common obstacles to demand-side energy 
behaviour change, from loss aversion to present bias (for more detail 
see Chapter 5 Supplementary Material I). Choice architecture refers 
to interventions (‘nudges’) that shape the choice context and how 
choices are presented, with seemingly-irrelevant details (e.g., option 
order or labels) often more important than option price (Thaler and 
Sunstein 2009). There is high evidence and high agreement that 
choice architecture nudges shape energy decisions by capturing 
deciders’ attention; engaging their desire to contribute to the social 
and making complex information more accessible (Yoeli et al. 2017; 
Zangheri et  al. 2019). Climate-friendly choice architecture includes 
the setting of proper defaults, the salient positioning of green options 
(in stores and online), forms of framing, and communication of social 
norms (Johnson et al. 2012). Simplifying access to greener options (and 
hence lowering effort) can promote ASI changes (Mani et al. 2013). 
Setting effective ‘green’ defaults may be the most effective policy to 
mainstream low-carbon energy choices (Sunstein and Reisch 2014), 
adopted in many contexts (Jachimowicz et  al. 2019) and deemed 
acceptable in many countries (Sunstein et al. 2019). Table 5.3a lists 
how often different choice-architecture tools were used in many 
countries over the past 10 years to change ASI behaviours, and how 
often each tool was used to enhance an economic incentive. These 
tools have been tested mostly in developed countries. Reduction 
in energy use (typically electricity consumption) is the most widely 
studied behaviour (because metering is easily observable). All 
but one tool was applied to increase this ‘Avoid’ behaviour, with 
demand-side reductions from 0% to up to 20%, with most values 
below 3% (see also meta-analyses by Hummel and Maedche (2019); 
Nisa et al. (2019); van der Linden and Goldberg (2020); Stankuniene 
et al. (2020); and Khanna et al. (2021). Behavioural, economic, and 
legal instruments are most effective when applied as an internally 
consistent ensemble where they can reinforce each other, a concept referred to as ‘policy packaging’ in transport policy research (Givoni 
2014). A meta-analysis, combining evidence of psychological and 
economic studies, demonstrates that feedback, monetary incentives 
and social comparison operate synergistically and are together more 
effective than the sum of individual interventions (Khanna et al. 2021). 
The same meta-analysis also shows that combined with monetary 
incentives, nudges and choice architecture can reduce global GHG 
emissions from household energy use by 5–6% (Khanna et al. 2021).
Choice architecture has been depicted as an anti-democratic attempt 
at manipulating the behaviour of actors without their awareness or 
approval (Gumbert 2019). Such critiques ignore the fact that there 
is no neutral way to present energy-use-related decisions, as every 
presentation format and choice environment influences choice, 
whether intentionally or not. Educating households and policy makers 
about the effectiveness of choice architecture and adding these 
behavioural tools to existing market- and regulation-based tools in 
a  transparent and consultative way can provide desired outcomes 
with increased effectiveness, while avoiding charges of manipulation 
or deception. People consent to choice-architecture tools if their 
use is welfare-enhancing, policymakers are transparent about 
their goals and processes, public deliberation and participation are 
encouraged, and the choice architect is trusted (Sunstein et al. 2019).

Note: Papers in this review of behavioural interventions to reduce household energy demand were collected through a systemic literature search up to August 2021. Studies 
are included in the reported counts if they are (i) experimental, (ii) peer-reviewed or highly cited reports, (iii) the intervention is behavioural, and (iv) the targeted behaviour is 
household energy demand. 559 papers are included in the review. Each paper was coded for: type of behavioural intervention, country of study, energy demand behaviour 
targeted, whether the target is an ‘Avoid’, ‘Shift’, or ‘Improve’ behaviour, and whether the intervention includes an economic incentive. Some papers do not report all elements. 
The energy demand behaviour column provides the count of papers that focus on each behaviour type (in parentheses after the behaviour). The citations that follow are not 
exhaustive but exemplify papers in the category, selected for impact, range, and recency. The asterisk (*) indicates references that are meta-analyses or systematic reviews. 
Papers within meta-analyses and systematic reviews that meet the inclusion criteria are counted individually in the total counts. The full reference list is available at https://osf.

Set proper defaultMeta-analyses find a medium to strong effect of defaults on environmental behaviour. 
Jachimowicz et al. (2019) report a strong average effect of defaults on environmental 
behaviour (Cohen’s d = 0.75, confidence interval 0.39–1.12), though not as high as for 
consumer decisions. They find that defaults, across domains, are more effective when they 
reflect an endorsement (recommendation by a trusted source) or endowment (reflecting 
the status quo). Nisa et al. (2019)* report a medium average effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.35; 
range 0.04–0.55).
Reach out during 
transitionsThe few interventions that focus on transitions and measure behaviour change (rather 
than energy savings) report mixed, moderate effect sizes. People were unwilling to change 
their behaviour if they were satisfied with current options (Mahapatra and Gustavsson 
2008). Iweka et al. (2019) find that effective messages can prompt habit disruption.
Timely feedback 
and remindersThe average effects of meta-analyses of feedback interventions on household energy 
use reductions range from 1.8% to 7.7%, with large variations (Delmas et al. 2013; 
Buckley 2019; Nisa et al. 2019; Buckley 2020; Ahir and Chakraborty 2021; Khanna et al. 
2021). The same is true for two literature reviews (Abrahamse et al. 2005; Bergquist 
et al. 2019). Most studies find a 4–10% average reduction during the intervention; 
some studies find a non-significant result (Dünnhoff and Duscha 2008) or a negative 
reduction (Winett et al. 1978).
Real-time feedback is most effective, followed by personalised feedback (Buckley 2019; 
Buckley 2020). A review by Darby et al. (2006) finds direct feedback (from the meter or 
display monitor) is more effective than indirect feedback (via billing) (5–15% savings vs 
0–10% savings). Feedback effects (Cohen’s d = 0.241) are increased when combined with 
a monetary incentive (Cohen’s d = 0.96) and with a social comparison and a monetary 
incentive (Cohen’s d = 0.714) (Khanna et al. 2021).
Sanguinetti et al. (2020) find that onboard feedback results in a 6.6% improvement in 
the fuel economy of cars (Cohen’s d: 0.07, [range 0.05–0.08]).

Timely feedback 
and reminders 
(continued)The effectiveness of feedback from in home displays is highly studied. Two reviews find 
them to have result in a 2–14% energy saving (Ehrhardt-Martinez and Donnelly 2010; 
Faruqui et al. 2010). A meta-analysis by McKerracher and Torriti (2013) finds a smaller 
range of results, with 3–5% energy savings.
Make information 
intuitive and easy 
to accessMeta-analyses of information interventions on household energy use find average energy 
savings between 1.8–7.4% and Cohen’s d effect sizes between 0.05 and 0.30 (Delmas 
et al. 2013; Buckley 2019; Nisa et al. 2019);* Buckley 2020; Nemati and Penn 2020; Ahir 
and Chakraborty 2021; Khanna et al. 2021). Study quality affects the measured effect – 
small sample sizes, shorter measurement windows, and self-selection are correlated with 
larger effects (Nisa et al. 2019; Nemati and Penn 2020). RCTs have a smaller effect size, 
5.2% savings (95% confidence interval [range 0.5% –9.5%]) (Nemati and Penn 2020).
Information combined with comparative feedback is more effective than information 
alone (d = .34 vs. 30 (Khanna et al. 2021); 8.5% vs 7.4% (Delmas et al. 2013). Monetary 
incentives make information interventions more effective (Khanna et al. 2021).
Energy efficiency labeling has a heterogenous effect on investment in energy efficiency 
(Abrahamse et al. 2005; Andor and Fels 2018). Efficiency labels on houses lead to higher 
price mark ups (Jensen et al. 2016) and house prices (Brounen and Kok 2011). Energy star 
labels lead to significantly higher willingness to pay for refrigerators (Houde et al. 2013), 
but energy and water conservation varies by appliance from 0–23% (Kurz et al. 2005).
A meta-analysis of interventions to increase alternative fuel vehicle adoption find a small 
effect (d = .20–.28) (Pettifor et al. 2017).

Make behaviour 
observable and

(Winett et al. 1978; Handgraaf et al. 2013; Nemati and Penn 2020) and a large effects 
size (Cohen’s d = 0.79-1.06); (Nisa et al. 2019*). Community-wide interventions result 
in 1–27% energy savings (Iweka et al. 2019).
Neighbourhood social influence has a small (d = .28) effect on alternative fuel vehicle 
adoption (Pettifor et al. 2017).
Communicate 
a normThe effect of social norm information on household energy savings ranges from  
1.7–11.5% (Delmas et al. 2013; Buckley 2020) and Cohen’s d from 0.08–0.32, 
(Abrahamse and Steg 2013; Bergquist et al. 2019; Khanna et al. 2021); (Nisa et al. 2019)* 
with similar effects on choice of mode of transportation. Pettifor et al. (2017) report 
a small effect (d = .20–.28) on selecting a more energy efficient car.
The OPOWER study (Allcott 2011), prototypical for the impact of social norms on household 
energy consumption, finds 2% reduction in long-term energy use and 11–20% energy 
reduction in the short run (Allcott 2011; Ayres et al. 2013; Costa and Kahn 2013; Allcott 
and Rogers 2014). Impact decays over time (Allcott and Rogers 2012). Norm interventions 
are less effective for low energy users (Schultz et al. 2007; Andor et al. 2020). Moral 
licensing and negative spillover can reduce the overall positive feedback of normative 
feedback (Tiefenbeck et al. 2013).
Interventions are more effective when the norm is implicitly inducted, in individual 
countries, and when people care about the norm (Nolan et al. 2008; Bergquist et al. 2019; 
Khanna et al. 2021). Descriptive norm interventions (social comparisons) are more effective 
when communicated online,by email or through in-home displays compared to billing 
letters (Andor and Fels 2018), when the reference group is more specific (Shen et al. 2015). 
Dolan and Metcalfe (2013) find conservation increased from 4% to 11% when energy 
savings tips are added.

Reframe 
consequences in 
terms people care 
aboutA meta-analysis by Khanna et al. ( 2021) finds a small and variable effect of 
motivational interventions that reframe consequences (Cohen’s d = [0–0.423]). Effects 
are larger when reframing is combined with monetary incentives and feedback (d = .96). 
Darby et al. (2006) report 10–20% savings for US pay-as-you-go systems. Providing 
lifecycle cost information increases likelihood of purchasing eco-innovative products 
(Kaenzig and Wüstenhagen 2010). Long term (10-year) operating cost information leads 
to higher willingness to pay for energy efficiency compared to short-term (1-year) cost 
information (Heinzle and Wüstenhagen 2012). Monetary information increases the success 
of energy reduction interventions (Newell and Siikamäki 2014; Andor and Fels 2018). 
Reframing interventions are more effective when combined with feedback (d = .24–.96) 
and with social comparisons and feedback (d = .42) (Khanna et al. 2021).
Obtain 
a commitmentCommitment and goal interventions result in significant energy reduction in half of studies 
(Abrahamse et al. 2005; Andor and Fels 2018; Nisa et al. 2019*). Nisa et al. (2019) report 
a moderate average effect (Cohen’s d = 0.34, [0.11–0.66]). When results are significant, 
the energy savings are around 10% (Andor and Fels 2018). Self-set goals perform better 
than assigned goals (van Houwelingen and van Raaij 1989; McCalley and Midden 2002; 
Andor and Fels 2018) and reasonable goals perform better than unreasonably high or 
low goals (van Houwelingen and van Raaij 1989; Abrahamse et al. 2007; Harding and 
Hsiaw 2014). Interventions are more effective when the commitment is public (Pallak 
and Cummings 1976) and when combined with information and rewards (Slavin et al. 
1981; Völlink and Meertens 1999).

Collective behaviours and social organisation are part of everyday 
life, and feeling part of active collective action renders mitigation 
measures efficient and pervasive (Climact 2018). Social and cultural 
processes play an important role in shaping what actions people 
take on climate mitigation, interacting with individual, structural, 
institutional and economic drivers (Barr and Prillwitz 2014). Just like 
infrastructure, social and cultural processes can ‘lock in’ societies to 
carbon-intensive patterns of service delivery. They also offer potential 
levers to change normative ideas and social practices in order to 
achieve extensive emissions cuts (high confidence) (Table 5.4).
In terms of cultural processes, we can distinguish two levels of 
analysis: specific meanings associated with particular technologies 
or practices, and general narratives about climate change mitigation. 
Specific meanings (e.g.,  comfort, status, identity and agency) are 
associated with many technologies and everyday social practices that 
deliver energy services, from driving a car to using a cookstove (high 
evidence, high agreement) (Section 5.5). Meanings are symbolic and 
influence the willingness of individuals to use existing technologies 
or shift to new ones (Wilhite and Ling 1995; Wilhite 2009; Sorrell 
2015). Symbolic motives are more important predictors of technology 
adoption than instrumental motives (Steg 2005; Noppers et al. 2014; 
Noppers et  al. 2015; Noppers et  al. 2016) (see case study on app 
cabs in Kolkata, India (Box 5.8)). If an individual’s pro-environmental 
behaviour is associated with personal meaning than it also increases 
subjective well-being (Zawadzki et al. 2020). Status consciousness is 
highly relevant in GHG emission-intensive consumption choices (cars, 
houses). However, inversely framing energy-saving behaviour as high 
status is a promising strategy for emission reduction (Ramakrishnan 
and Creutzig 2021).
At a  broader level, narratives about climate mitigation circulate within 
and across societies, as recognised in SR1.5, and are broader than the 
meanings associated with specific technologies (high evidence, high 
agreement). Narratives enable people to imagine and make sense 
of the future through processes of interpretation, understanding, 
communication and social interaction (Smith et  al. 2017). Stories 
about climate change are relevant for mitigation in numerous ways. 
They can be utopian or dystopian (e.g.,  The great derangement by 
Amitav Ghosh) (Ghosh 2016), for example presenting apocalyptic 
stories and imagery to capture people’s attention and evoke emotional 
and behavioural response (O’Neill and Smith 2014). Reading climate 
stories has been shown to cause short-term influences on attitudes 
towards climate change, increasing the belief that climate change is 
human caused and increasing its issue priority (Schneider-Mayerson 
et al. 2020). Climate narratives can also be used to justify scepticism 
of science, drawing together coalitions of diverse actors into social 
movements that aim to prevent climate action (Lejano and Nero 
2020). Narratives are also used in integrated assessment and energy 
system models that construct climate stabilisation scenarios, for 
example in the choice of parameters, their interpretation and model 
structure (Ellenbeck and Lilliestam 2019). One important narrative 
choice of many models involves framing climate change as market 
failure (which leads to the result that carbon pricing is required). While such a choice can be justified, other model framings can be 
equally justified (Ellenbeck and Lilliestam 2019).
Power and agency shape which climate narratives are told and how 
prevalent they are (O’Neill and Smith 2014; Schneider-Mayerson 
et al. 2020). For example, narratives have been used by indigenous 
communities to imagine climate futures divergent from top-down, 
government-led narratives (Streeby 2018). The uptake of new climate 
narratives is influenced by political beliefs and trust. Policymakers can 
enable emissions reduction by employing narratives that have broad 
societal appeal, encourage behavioural change and complement 
regulatory and fiscal measures (Terzi 2020). Justice narratives may 
not have universal appeal: in a  UK study, justice narratives 
polarised individuals along ideological lines, with lower support 
amongst individuals with right-wing beliefs; by contrast, narratives 
centred on saving energy, avoiding waste and patriotic values were 
more widely supported across society (Whitmarsh and Corner 2017). 
More research is needed to assess if these findings are prevalent in 
diverse socio-cultural contexts, as well as the role played by social 
media platforms to influence emerging narratives of climate change 
(Pearce et al. 2019).
Trust in organisations is a key predictor of the take-up of novel energy 
services (Lutzenhiser 1993), particularly when financial incentives 
are high (Stern et al. 1985; Joskow 1995). Research has shown that 
if there is low public trust in utility companies, service delivery by 
community-based non-profit organisations in the US (Stern et  al. 
1985) or public/private partnerships in Mexico (Friedmann and 
Sheinbaum 1998), offer more effective solutions, yet only if public 
trust is higher in these types of organisations. UK research shows 
that acceptance of shifts to less resource-intensive service provision 
(e.g., more resource-efficient products, extending product lifetimes, 
community schemes for sharing products) varies depending on factors 
including trust in suppliers and manufacturers, affordability, quality 
and hygiene of shared products, and fair allocation of responsibilities 
(Cherry et  al. 2018). Trust in other people plays an important role 
in the sharing economy (Li and Wang 2020), for example predicting 
shifts in transport mode, specifically car sharing involving rides with 
strangers (Acheampong and Siiba 2019) (Section 5.3.4.2).
Action on climate mitigation is influenced by our perception of 
what other people commonly do, think or expect, known as social 
norms (high evidence, high agreement) (Cialdini 2006) (Table 5.3), 
even though people often do not acknowledge this (Nolan et  al. 
2008; Noppers et al. 2014). Changing social norms can encourage 
societal transformation and social tipping points to address climate 
mitigation (Nyborg et al. 2016; Otto et al. 2020). Providing feedback 
to people about how their own actions compare to others’ can 
encourage mitigation (Delmas et  al. 2013), although the overall 
effect size is not strong (Abrahamse and Steg 2013). Trending 
norms are behaviours that are becoming more popular, even if 
currently practised by a minority. Communicating messages that the 
number of people engaging in a mitigation behaviour (e.g., giving 
a financial donation to an environmental conservation organisation) 
is increasing – a simple low-cost policy intervention – can encourage 
shifts to the targeted behaviour, even if the effect size is relatively 
small (Mortensen et al. 2019).
people strongly identify with the reference group (De Dominicis 
et al. 2019). Descriptive norms (perceptions of behaviours common 
in others) are more strongly related to mitigation actions when 
injunctive norms (perceptions of whether certain behaviours are 
commonly approved or disapproved) are also strong, when people 
are not strongly personally involved with mitigation topics (Göckeritz 
et  al. 2010), when people are currently acting inconsistently with 
their preferences, when norm-based interventions are supported by 
other interventions and when the context supports norm-congruent 
actions (Miller and Prentice 2016). A descriptive norm prime (‘most 
other people try to reduce energy consumption’) together with 
injunctive norm feedback (‘you are very good at saving energy’) 
is a  very effective combination to motivate further energy savings 
(Bonan et al. 2020). Second-order beliefs (perceptions of what others 
in the community believe) are particularly important for leveraging 
descriptive norms (Jachimowicz et al. 2018).
Behavioural contagion, which describes how ideas and behaviours 
often spread like infectious diseases, is a  major contributor to the 
climate crisis (Sunstein 2019). But harnessing contagion can also 
mitigate warming. Carbon-heavy consumption patterns have become 
the norm only in part because we’re not charged for environmental 
damage we cause (Pigou 1920). The deeper source of these patterns 
has been peer influence (Frank 1999), because what we do influences 
others. A rooftop solar installation early in the adoption cycle, for 
example, spawns a copycat installation in the same neighbourhood 
within four months, on average. With such installations thus doubling 
every four months, a  single new order results in 32 additional 
installations in just two years. And contagion doesn’t stop there, since 
each family also influences friends and relatives in distant locations.
Harnessing contagion can also underwrite the investment necessary 
for climate stability. If taxed more heavily, top earners would spend 
less, shifting the frames of reference that shape spending of those just 
below, and so on – each step simultaneously reducing emissions and 
liberating resources for additional green investment (Frank  2020). 
Many resist, believing that higher taxes would make it harder to 
buy life’s special extras. But that belief is a cognitive illusion (Frank 
2020). Acquiring special things, which are inherently in short supply, 
requires outbidding others who also want them. When top tax rates 
rise in tandem, relative bidding power is completely unchanged, so 
the same penthouse apartments would end up in the same hands 
as before. More generally, behavioural contagion is important to 
leverage all relevant social tipping points for stabilising Earth’s 
climate (Otto et al. 2020).
For new climate policies and mitigation technologies to be rapidly 
and extensively implemented, they must be socially acceptable to 
those who are directly impacted by those policies and technologies 
(medium evidence, high agreement). Policies that run counter to 
social norms or cultural meanings are less likely to be effective in 
reducing emissions (Demski et  al. 2015; Perlaviciute et  al. 2018; 
Roy et  al. 2018b). More just and acceptable implementation of 
renewable energy technologies requires taking account of the 
cultural meanings, emotional attachments and identities linked 
to particular landscapes and places where those technologies are proposed (Devine-Wright  2009) and enabling fairness in how 
decisions are taken and costs and benefits distributed (Wolsink 
2007). This is important for achieving the goal of SDG 7 (increased 
use of renewable energy resources) in developing countries while 
achieving energy justice (Calzadilla and Mauger 2017). ‘Top-down’ 
imposition of climate policies by governments can translate into local 
opposition when perceived to be unjust and lacking transparency 
(high evidence, high agreement). Policymakers can build trust and 
increase the legitimacy of new policies by implementing early 
and extensive public and stakeholder participation, avoiding ‘Nimby’ 
(Not In My Back Yard) assumptions about objectors and adopting 
‘Just Transition’ principles (Owens 2000; Wolsink 2007; Wüstenhagen 
et al. 2007; Dietz and Stern 2008; Devine-Wright 2011; Heffron and 
McCauley 2018). Participatory mechanisms that enable deliberation 
by a representative sample of the public (Climate Assembly UK 2020) 
can inform policymaking and increase the legitimacy of new and 
difficult policy actions (Dryzek et al. 2019).
Collective action by civil society groups and social movements can 
work to enable or constrain climate mitigation. Civil society groups 
can advocate policy change, provide policy research and open up 
opportunities for new political reforms (high evidence, high agreement) 
as recognised in previous IPCC reports (IPCC 2007). Grassroots 
environmental initiatives, including community energy groups, are 
collective responses to, and critiques of, normative ways that everyday 
material needs (e.g., food, energy, making) are produced, supplied and 
circulated (Schlosberg and Coles 2016). Such initiatives can reconcile 
lower carbon footprints with higher life satisfaction and higher 
incomes (Vita et al. 2020). Local initiatives such as Transition Towns 
and community energy projects can lead to improvements in energy 
efficiency, ensure a decent standard of living and increase renewable 
energy uptake, while building on existing social trust, and, in turn, 
building social trust and initiating engagement, capacity building, and 
social capital formation (Hicks and Ison 2018). Another example are 
grassroot initiatives that aim to reduce food loss and waste, even as 
overall evidence on their effectiveness remains limited (Mariam et al. 
2020). However, community energy initiatives are not always inclusive 
and require policy support for widespread implementation across all 
socio-economic groups (Aiken et al. 2017). In addition, more evidence 
is required of the impacts of community energy initiatives (Creamer 
et al. 2018; Bardsley et al. 2019).
Civil society social movements are a  primary driver of social and 
institutional change (high evidence, high agreement) and can be 
differently positioned as, on the one hand, ‘insider’ social movements 
(e.g., World Wildlife Fund) that seek to influence existing state 
institutions through lobbying, advice and research and, on the 
other hand, ‘outsider’ social movements (e.g., Rising Tide, Extinction 
Rebellion) that advocate radical reform through protests and 
demonstrations (Newell 2005; Caniglia et al. 2015). Civil society social 
movements frame grievances that resonate with society, mobilise 
resources to coordinate and sustain mass collective action, and 
operate within  – and seek to influence  – external conditions that 
enable or constrain political change (Caniglia et  al. 2015). When 
successful, social movements open up windows of opportunity 
(so called ‘Overton Windows’) to unlock structural change (high 
evidence, high agreement) (Szałek 2013; Piggot 2018).
for climate mitigation (e.g.,  ‘climate emergency’) (della Porta 
and Parks 2014); criticise positive meanings associated with high 
emission technologies or practices (see case studies on diet and 
solar PV, (Boxes 5.5 and 5.7)); show disapproval for high-emission 
behaviours (e.g., through ‘flight shaming’); model behaviour change 
(e.g., shifting to veganism or public transport – see case study on 
mobility in Kolkata, India (Box 5.8)); demonstrate against extraction 
and use of fossil fuels (Cheon and Urpelainen 2018); and aim to 
increase a sense of agency amongst certain social groups (e.g., young 
people or indigenous communities) that structural change is possible. 
Climate strikes have become internationally prevalent, for example 
the September 2019 strikes involved participants in more than 

et  al. 2020). Enabled by digitalisation, these have given voice to 
youth on climate (Lee et al. 2020) and created a new cohort of active 
citizens engaged in climate demonstrations (Fisher 2019). Research 
on bystanders shows that marches increase positive beliefs about 
marchers and collective efficacy (Swim et al. 2019).
Countermovement coalitions work to oppose climate mitigation (high 
confidence). Examples include efforts in the US to oppose mandatory 
limits on carbon emissions supported by organisations from the coal and electrical utility sectors (Brulle 2019). There is evidence that 
US opposition to climate action by carbon-connected industries is 
broad-based, highly organised, and matched with extensive lobbying 
(Cory et al., 2021). Social movements can also work to prevent policy 
changes, for example in France the Gilet Jaunes objected to increases 
in fuel costs on the grounds that they unfairly distributed the costs 
and benefits of price rises across social groups, for example between 
urban, peri-urban and rural areas (Copland 2019).
Religion could play an important role in enabling collective action 
on climate mitigation by providing cultural interpretations of change 
and institutional responses that provide resources and infrastructure 
to sustain collective actions (Roy et  al. 2012; Haluza-DeLay 2014; 
Caniglia et  al. 2015; Hulme 2015). Religion can be an important 
cultural resource towards sustainability at individual, community and 
institutional levels (Ives and Kidwell 2019), providing leverage points 
for inner transformation towards sustainability (Woiwode et  al. 
2021). Normative interpretations of climate change for and from 
religious communities are found in nearly every geography, and often 
observe popular movements for climate action drawing on religious 
symbols or metaphors (Jenkins et al. 2018). This suggests the value for 
policymakers of involving religious constituencies as significant civil 
society organisations in devising and delivering climate responses.
Box 5.7 | Solar PV and the Agency of Consumers
As an innovative technology, solar PV was strongly taken up by consumers (Nemet 2019). Several key factors explain its success. First, 
modular design made it applicable to different scales of deployment in different geographical contexts (e.g., large-scale grid-connected 
projects and smaller-scale off-grid projects) and allowed its application by companies taking advantage of emerging markets (Shum 
and Watanabe 2009). Second, culturally, solar PV symbolised an environmentally progressive technology that was valued by users 
(Morris and Jungjohann 2016). Large-scale adoption led to policy change (i.e., the introduction of feed-in tariffs that guaranteed 
a financial return) that in turn enabled improvements to the technology by companies. Over time, this has driven large-scale reductions 
in cost and increase in deployment worldwide. The relative importance of drivers varied across contexts. In Japan, state subsidies were 
lower yet did not hinder take-up because consumer behaviour was motivated by non-cost symbolic aspects. In Germany, policy change 
arose from social movements that campaigned for environmental conservation and opposed nuclear power, making solar PV policies 
politically acceptable. In summary, the seven-decade evolution of solar PV shows an evolution in which the agency of consumers has 
consistently played a key role in multiple countries, such that deriving 30–50% of global electricity supply from solar is now a realistic 
possibility (Creutzig et al. 2017). See more in Chapter 5 Supplementary Material I, 5.SM.6.1.
5.4.3 Business and Corporate Drivers
Businesses and corporate organisations play a  key role in the 
mitigation of global warming, through their own commitments 
to zero-carbon footprints (Mendiluce 2021), decisions to invest 
in researching and implementing new energy technologies and 
energy-efficient measures, and the supply-side interaction with 
changing consumer preferences and behaviours, such as via 
marketing. Business models and strategies work both as a barrier 
to and an accelerator of decarbonisation. Still existing locked-
in infrastructures and business models advantages fossil fuel 
industry over renewable and energy efficient end use industry 
(Klitkou et al. 2015). The fossil fuel energy generation and delivery 
system therefore epitomises a  barrier to the acceptance and implementation of new and cleaner renewable energy technologies 
(Kariuki 2018). A good number of corporate agents have attempted 
to derail climate change mitigation by targeted lobbying and doubt-
inducing media strategies (Oreskes and Conway 2011). A number of 
corporations that are involved in both upstream and downstream 
supply chains of fossil fuel companies make up the majority of 
organisations opposed to climate action (Dunlap and McCright 
2015; Brulle 2019; Cory et  al. 2021). Corporate advertisement 
and brand-building strategies also attempt to deflect corporate 
responsibility to individuals, and/or to appropriate climate care 
sentiments in their own brand building; climate change mitigation 
is uniquely framed through choice of products and consumption, 
avoiding the notion of the political collective action sphere (Doyle 
2011; Doyle et al. 2019).
decarbonisation, as demonstrated in the case of PV and battery 
electric cars (Teece 2018). Beyond new low-carbon technologies, 
strong sustainability business models are characterised by identifying 
nature as the primary stakeholder, strong local anchorage, the creation 
of diversified income sources, and deliberate limitations on economic 
growth (Brozovic 2019). However, such business models are difficult 
to maintain if generally traditional business models, which require 
short-term accounting, prevail.
Liability of fossil fuel business models and insurance against climate 
damages are key concerns of corporations and business. Limitations 
and regulation on GHG emissions will compel reductions in demand for 
fossil fuel companies’ products (Porter and Kramer 2006). According 
to a  report by the Advisory Scientific Committee of the European 
Systemic Risk Board, insurance industries are very likely to incur losses 
due to liability risks (ESRB 2016). The divestment movement adds 
additional pressure on fossil fuel related investments (Braungardt 
et al. 2019), even though fossil fuel financing remains resilient (Curran 
2020). Companies, businesses and organisations, especially those 
in the carbon-intensive energy sector, might face liability claims for 
their contribution to climate change. A late transition to a low-carbon 
economy would exacerbate the physical costs of climate change on 
governments, businesses and corporations (ESRB 2016).
Despite the seemingly positive roles that businesses and corporate 
organisations tend to play towards sustainable transitions, there is 
a need to highlight the dynamic relationship between sustainable and 
unsustainable trends (Antal et al. 2020), or example, the production 
of sport utility vehicles (SUVs) in the automobile market at the 
same time that car manufacturers are producing electric vehicles. 
An analysis of the role of consumers as drivers of unsustainability 
for businesses and corporate organisations is very important here as 
this trend will offset the sustainability progress being made by these 
businesses and organisations (Antal et al. 2020).
Professional actors, such as building managers, landlords, energy 
efficiency advisers, technology installers and car dealers, influence 
patterns of mobility and energy consumption (Shove 2003) by acting 
as ‘middle actors’ (Janda and Parag 2013; Parag and Janda 2014) 
or intermediaries in the provision of building or mobility services (Grandclément et al. 2015; De Rubens et al. 2018). Middle actors can 
bring about change in several different directions, be it, upstream, 
downstream or sideways. They can redefine professional ethics 
around sustainability issues, and, as influencers on the process of 
diffusion of innovations (Rogers 2003), professionals can enable or 
obstruct improvements in efficient service provision or shifts towards 
low-carbon technologies (e.g.,  air and ground source heat pumps, 
solar hot water, underfloor heating, programmable thermostats, and 
mechanical ventilation with heat recovery) and mobility technologies 
(e.g., electric vehicles).
5.4.4 Institutional Drivers
The allocation of political power to incumbent actors and coalitions 
has contributed to lock-in of particular institutions, stabilising the 
interests of incumbents through networks that include policymakers, 
bureaucracies, advocacy groups and knowledge institutions 
(high agreement, high evidence). There is high evidence and high 
agreement that institutions are central in addressing climate change 
mitigation. Indeed, social provisioning contexts, including equity, 
democracy, public services and high quality infrastructure, are 
found to facilitate high levels of need satisfaction at lower energy 
use, whereas economic growth beyond moderate incomes and 
dependence on extractive industries inhibit it (Vogel et  al. 2021). 
They shape and interact with technological systems (Unruh 2000; 
Foxon et  al. 2004; Seto et  al. 2014) and represent rules, norms 
and conventions that organise and structure actions (Vatn 2015) 
and help create new path dependency or strengthen existing path 
dependency (Mattioli et al. 2020) (see case studies in Boxes 5.5 to 
5.8 and Chapter 5 Supplementary Material I). These drive behaviour 
of actors through formal (e.g.,  laws, regulations, and standards) 
or informal (e.g.,  norms, habits, and customs) processes, and can 
create constraints on policy options (Breukers and Wolsink 2007). 
For example, the car-dependent transport system is maintained by 
interlocking elements and institutions, consisting of (i) the automotive 
industry; (ii) the provision of car infrastructure; (iii)  the political 
economy of urban sprawl; (iv)  the provision of public transport; 
(v) cultures of car consumption (Mattioli et al. 2020). The behaviour 
of actors, their processes and implications on policy options and 
decisions are discussed further in Section 5.6.
Box 5.8 | Shifts from Private to Public Transport in an Indian Megacity
In densely populated, fast-growing megacities, policymakers face the difficult challenge of preventing widespread adoption of petrol 
or diesel fuelled private cars as a mode of transport. The megacity of Kolkata in India provides a useful case study. As many as twelve 
different modes of public transportation, each with its own system structure, actors and meanings, co-exist and offer means of 
mobility to its 14 million citizens. Most of the public transport modes are shared mobility options, ranging from sharing between two 
people in a rickshaw or a few hundred in metro or sub-urban trains. Sharing also happens informally as daily commuters avail shared 
taxis and neighbours borrow each other’s car or bicycle for urgent or day trips.
Technologies and infrastructures shape social practices and their 
design matters for effective mitigation measures (high evidence, 
high agreement). There are systemic interconnections between 
infrastructures and practices (Cass et al. 2018; Haberl et al. 2021), 
and their intersection explains their relevance (Thacker et al. 2019). 
The design of a new electricity system to meet new emerging demand 
based on intermittent renewable sources can lead to a  change 
in consumption habits and the adaption of lifestyles compliant 
with more power supply interruption (Maïzi et al. 2017; Maïzi and 
Mazauric 2019). The quality of the service delivery impacts directly 
the potential user uptake of low-carbon technologies among rural 
households. In the state of Himachal Pradesh in India, a shift from 
LPG to electricity among rural households, with induction stoves, 
has been successful due to the availability of stable and continuous 
electricity, which has been difficult to achieve in any other Indian 
state (Banerjee et al. 2016). In contrast, in South Africa, people who 
were using electricity earlier are now adopting LPG to diversify the 
energy source for cooking due to high electricity tariffs and frequent 
blackouts (Kimemia and Annegarn 2016) (Box  5.5 and Chapter  5 
Supplementary Material I).
From a  welfare point of view, infrastructure investments are not 
constrained by revealed or stated preferences (high evidence, 
high agreement). Preferences change with social and physical 
environment, and infrastructure interventions can be justified by objective measures, such as public health and climate change 
mitigation, not only given preferences (high agreement,  high 
evidence). Specifically, there is a case for more investment in low-
carbon transport infrastructure than assumed in environmental 
economics as it induces low-carbon preferences (Creutzig et  al. 
2016a; Mattauch et  al. 2016; Mattauch et  al. 2018). Changes in 
infrastructure provision for active travel may contribute to uptake 
of more walking and cycling (Frank et  al. 2019). These effects 
contribute to higher uptake of low-carbon travel options, albeit 
the magnitude of effects depends on design choices and context 
(Goodman et  al. 2013; Goodman et  al. 2014; Song et  al. 2017; 
Javaid et  al. 2020; Abraham et  al. 2021). Infrastructure is thus 
not only required to make low-carbon travel possible but can 
also be a pre-condition for the formation of low-carbon mobility 
preferences (see case study in Box 5.8).
The dynamic interaction of habits and infrastructures also predict 
CO2-intensive choices. When people move from a  city with good 
public transport to a  car-dependent city, they are more likely to 
own fewer vehicles due to learned preferences for lower levels of 
car ownership (Weinberger and Goetzke 2010). When individuals 
moving to a  new city with extensive public transport were given 
targeted material about public transport options, the modal share 
of public transport increased significantly (Bamberg et  al. 2003). 
Similarly, an exogenous change to route choice in public transport 
makes commuters change their habitual routes (Larcom et al. 2017).Box 5.8 (continued)
A key role is played by the state government, in collaboration with other stakeholders, to improve the system as whole and formalise 
certain semi-formal modes of transport. An important policy consideration has been to make Kolkata’s mobility system more efficient 
(in terms of speed, reliability and avoidance of congestion) and sustainable through strengthening coordination between different 
mode-based regimes (Ghosh 2019) and more comfortable with air conditioned space in a hot and humid climate (Roy et al. 2018b). 
Policymakers have introduced multiple technological, behavioural and socio-cultural measures to tackle this challenge. New buses 
have been purchased by public authorities (Ghosh and Schot 2019). These have been promoted to middle class workers in terms of 
modernity, efficiency and comfort, and implemented using premium fares. Digitalisation and the sharing economy have encouraged 
take-up of shared taxi rides (‘app cabs’), being low cost and fast, but also influenced by levels of social trust involved in rides with 
strangers (Acheampong and Siiba 2019; Ghosh and Schot 2019). Rickshaws have been improved through use of LNG and cycling 
has been banned from busy roads. These measures contributed positively to halving greenhouse gas emissions per unit of GDP tin 
one decade within the Kolkata metropolitan area, with potential for further reduction (Colenbrander et al. 2016). However, social 
movements have opposed some changes due to concerns about social equity, since many of the new policies cater to middle class 
aspirations and preferences, at the cost of low-income and less privileged communities.
To conclude, urban mobility transitions in Kolkata show interconnected policy, institutional and socio-cultural drivers for socio-
technical change. Change has unfolded in complex interactions between multiple actors, sustainability values and megatrends, where 
direct causalities are hard to identify. However, the prominence of policy actors as change agents is clear as they are changing 
multiple regimes from within. The state government initiated infrastructural change in public bus systems, coordinated with private 
and non-governmental actors such as auto-rickshaw operators and app cab owners, who hold crucial agency in offering public 
transport services in the city. The latter can directly be attributed to the global momentum of mobility-as-a-service platforms, at the 
intersection of digitalisation and sharing economy trends. More thoughtful action at a policy level is required to sustain and coordinate 
the diversity of public transport modes through infrastructure design and reflect on the overall direction of change (Roy et al. 2018b; 
Schot and Steinmueller 2018). See more in Chapter 5 Supplementary Material I, Section 5.SM.6.3.

5.5 An Integrative View on Transitioning
5.5.1 Demand-side Transitions as 
Multi-dimensional Processes
Several integrative frameworks including social practice theory 
(Røpke 2009; Shove and Walker 2014), the energy cultures framework 
(Stephenson et  al. 2015; Jürisoo et  al. 2019) and socio-technical 
transitions theory (McMeekin and Southerton 2012; Geels et al. 2017) 
conceptualise demand-side transitions as multi-dimensional and 
interacting processes (high evidence, high agreement). Social practice 
theory emphasises interactions between artefacts, competences, 
and cultural meanings (Røpke 2009; Shove and Walker 2014). The 
energy cultures framework highlights feedbacks between materials, 
norms, and behavioural practices (Stephenson et  al. 2015; Jürisoo 
et al. 2019). Socio-technical transitions theory addresses interactions between technologies, user practices, cultural meanings, business, 
infrastructures, and public policies (McMeekin and Southerton 2012; 
Geels et  al. 2017) and can thus accommodate the five drivers of 
change and stability discussed in Section 5.4.
Section  5.4 shows with high evidence and high agreement that 
the relative influence of different drivers varies between demand-
side solutions. The deployment of ‘Improve’ options like LEDs and 
clean cookstoves mostly involves technological change, adoption by 
consumers who integrate new technologies in their daily life practices 
(Smith et  al. 1993; Sanderson and Simons 2014; Franceschini and 
Alkemade 2016), and some policy change. Changes in meanings 
are less pertinent for those ‘Improve’ options that are primarily 
about technological substitution. Other ‘Improve’ options, like clean 
cookstoves, involve both technological substitution and changes in 
cultural meanings and traditions.
substantial behavioural change and transitions to new or expanded 
provisioning systems, which may include new technologies (buses, 
trams), infrastructures (light rail, dedicated bus lanes), institutions 
(operational licences, performance contracts), financial arrangements, 
and new organisations (with particular responsibilities and oversight) 
(high evidence, high agreement) (Deng and Nelson 2011; Turnheim 
and Geels 2019). Changes in cultural meanings can facilitate ‘Shift’ 
options. Shifts towards low-meat diets, for instance, are motivated 
by costs and by beliefs about the undesirability of meat that relate 
more to issues like health, nutrition and animal welfare than climate 
change (De Boer et al. 2014; Mylan 2018).
‘Avoid’ options that reduce service levels (e.g.,  sufficiency or 
downshifting) imply very substantial behavioural and cultural 
changes that may not resonate with mainstream consumers (Dubois 
et  al. 2019). Other ‘Avoid’ options like teleworking also require 
changes in cultural meanings and beliefs (about the importance 
of supervision, coaching, social contacts, or office politics), as well 
as changes in behaviour, institutions, business, and technology 
(including good internet connections and office space at home). 
Because these interconnected changes were not widespread, 
teleworking remained stuck in small niches and did not diffuse widely 
before the COVID-19 crisis (Hynes 2014; Hynes 2016; Belzunegui-
Eraso and Erro-Garcés 2020; Stiles 2020). As preferences change, 
new infrastructures and social settings can also elicit new desires 
associated with emerging low-energy demand service provisioning 
systems (Section 5.4.5).
Demand-side transitions involve interactions between radical social 
or technical innovations (such as the Avoid-Shift-Improve options 
discussed in Section  5.3) and existing socio-technical systems, 
energy cultures, and social practices (high evidence, high agreement) 
(Stephenson et al. 2015; Geels et al. 2017). Radical innovations such 
as teleworking, plant-based burgers, car sharing, vegetarianism, or 
electric vehicles initially emerge in small, peripheral niches (Kemp 
et  al. 1998; Schot and Geels 2008), constituted by R&D projects, 
technological demonstration projects (Borghei and Magnusson 2016; 
Rosenbloom et al. 2018b), local community initiatives or grassroots 
projects by environmental activists (Hargreaves et al. 2013a; Hossain 
2016). Such niches offer protection from mainstream selection 
pressures and nurture the development of radical innovations (Smith 
and Raven 2012). Many low-carbon niche innovations, such as 
those described in Section 5.3, face uphill struggles against existing 
socio-technical systems, energy cultures, and social practices that 
are stabilised by multiple lock-in mechanisms (high evidence, high 
agreement) (Klitkou et  al. 2015; Seto et  al. 2016; Clausen et  al. 
2017; Ivanova et al. 2018). Demand-side transitions therefore do not 
happen easily and involve interacting processes and struggles on the 
behavioural, socio-cultural, institutional, business and technological 
dimensions (Nikas et al. 2020) (Section 5.4).
5.5.2 Phases in Transitions
Transitions often take several decades, unfolding through several 
phases. Although there is variability across innovations, sectors, and countries, the transitions literature distinguishes four phases, 
characterised by generic core processes and challenges: (i) emergence, 
(ii) early adaptation, (i) diffusion, (iv) stabilisation (high confidence) 
(Rotmans et  al. 2001; Markard et  al. 2012; Geels et  al. 2017) 
(Cross-Chapter Box 12 in Chapter 16). These four phases do not imply 
that transitions are linear, teleological processes, because set-backs 
or reversals may occur as a result of learning processes, conflicts, or 
changing coalitions (very high confidence) (Geels and Raven 2006; 
Messner 2015; Davidescu et al. 2018). There is also no guarantee that 
technological, social, or business model innovations progress beyond 
the first phase.
In the first phase, radical innovations emerge in peripheral niches, 
where researchers, inventors, social movement organisations or 
community activists dedicate time and effort to their development (high 
confidence) (Kemp et al. 1998; Schot and Geels 2008). Radical social, 
technical and business model innovations are initially characterised by 
many uncertainties about technical performance, consumer interest, 
institutions and cultural meanings. Learning processes are therefore 
essential and can be stimulated through R&D, demonstration projects, 
local community initiatives or grassroots projects (Borghei and 
Magnusson 2016; Hossain 2016; Rosenbloom et al. 2018b; van Mierlo 
and Beers 2020). Typical challenges are fragmentation and high rates 
of project failure (den Hartog et al. 2018; Dana et al. 2021), limited 
funding (Auerswald and Branscomb 2003), limited consumer interest, 
and socio-cultural acceptance problems due to being perceived as 
strange or unfamiliar (Lounsbury and Glynn 2001).
In the second phase, social or technical innovations are appropriated 
or purchased by early adopters, which increases visibility and may 
provide a small but steady flow of financial resources (high evidence, 
high agreement) (Zimmerman and Zeitz 2002; Dewald and Truffer 
2011). Learning processes, knowledge sharing and codification 
activities help stabilise the innovation, leading to best practice 
guidelines, standards, and formalised knowledge (high evidence, high 
agreement) (Raven et al. 2008; Borghei and Magnusson 2018). User 
innovation may lead to the articulation of new routines and social 
practices, often in tandem with the integration of new technologies 
into people’s daily lives (Nielsen et  al. 2016; Schot et  al. 2016). 
Radical innovations remain confined to niches in the second phase 
because adoption is limited to small, dedicated groups (Schot et al. 
2016), innovations are expensive or do not appeal to wider groups, 
or because complementary infrastructure are missing (Markard and 
Hoffmann 2016).
In the third phase, radical innovations diffuse into wider communities 
and mainstream markets. Typical drivers are performance 
improvements, cost reductions, widespread consumer interest, 
investments in infrastructure and complementary technologies, 
institutional support and strong cultural appeal (high evidence, high 
agreement) (Wilson 2012; Markard and Hoffmann 2016; Malone 
et al. 2017; Raven et al. 2017; Kanger et al. 2019). The latter may 
be related to wider cultural shifts such as increased public attention 
to climate change and new framings like ‘climate emergency’ which 
gained traction before the Covid-19 pandemic (Bouman et al. 2020b). 
These concerns may not last, however, since public attention typically 
follows cycles (Downs 1972; Djerf-Pierre 2012).
between low-carbon innovations and existing technologies and 
practices, business struggles between incumbents and new entrants 
(Hockerts and Wüstenhagen 2010), cultural and framing struggles in 
public opinion arenas (Kammermann and Dermont 2018; Rosenbloom 
2018; Hess 2019a), and political struggles over adjustments in policies 
and institutions, which shape markets and innovations (Meadowcroft 
2011; Roberts and Geels 2019). The lock-in mechanisms of existing 
practices and systems tend to weaken in the third phase, either 
because competing innovations erode their economic viability, 
cultural legitimacy or institutional support (Turnheim and Geels 2012; 
Roberts 2017; Kuokkanen et  al. 2018; Leipprand and Flachsland 
2018) or because exogenous shocks and pressures disrupt the status 
quo (Kungl and Geels 2018; Simpson 2019).
In the fourth phase, the diffusing innovations replace or substantially 
reconfigure existing practices and systems, which may lead to the 
downfall or reorientation of incumbent firms (Bergek et  al. 2013; 
McMeekin et  al. 2019). The new system becomes institutionalised 
and anchored in professional standards, technical capabilities, 
infrastructures, educational programmes, regulations and institutional 
logics, user habits, and views of normality, which create new lock-ins 
(Galaskiewicz 1985; Shove and Southerton 2000; Barnes et al. 2018).
‘Avoid’, ‘Shift’ and ‘Improve’ options vary with regard to the four 
transition phases. Incremental ‘Improve’ options, such as energy-
efficient appliances or stand-alone insulation measures, are not 
transitions but upgrades of existing technologies. They have 
progressed furthest since they build on existing knowledge and do 
not require wider changes (Geels et al. 2018). Some radical ‘Improve’ 
options, which have a different technological knowledge base, are 
beginning to diffuse, moving from phase two to three in multiple 
countries. Examples are electric vehicles, light-emitting diodes (LED), 
or passive house designs (Franceschini and Alkemade 2016; Berkeley 
et al. 2017). Many ‘Shift’ and ‘Avoid/Reduce’ options like heat pumps, 
district heating, passive house designs, compact cities, less meat 
initiatives, flight and car use reduction have low momentum in most 
countries, and are mostly in the first phase of isolated initiatives 
and projects (Bergman 2013; Morris et al. 2014; Bows-Larkin 2015; 
Bush et al. 2016; Kivimaa and Martiskainen 2018; Hoolohan et al. 
2018). Structural transitions in Dutch cities, Copenhagen, and 
more recently Paris, however, demonstrate that transitions towards 
low-carbon lifestyles, developed around cycling, are possible 
(Colville-Andersen  2018). Low-carbon demand-side transitions are 
often still in early phases (high evidence, high agreement).
5.5.3 Feasible Rate of Change
Transitional change is usually slow in the first and second transition 
phases, because experimentation, social and technological learning, 
and stabilisation processes take a  long time, often decades, and 
remain restricted to small niches (high confidence) (Wilson 2012; 
Bento 2013; Bento et al. 2018b). Transitional change accelerates in 
the third phase, as radical innovations diffuse from initial niches into 
mainstream markets, propelled by the self-reinforcing mechanisms 
discussed above. The rate of adoption (diffusion) of new practices, processes, artefacts, and behaviours is determined by a wide range 
of factors at the macro- and micro-scales, which have been identified 
by several decades of diffusion research in multiple disciplines 
(Mansfield 1968; Martino et  al. 1978; Davis 1979; Mahajan et  al. 
1990; Ausubel 1991; Grubler 1991; Feder and Umali 1993; Bayus 
1994; Comin and Hobijn 2003; Rogers 2003; Van den Bulte and 
Stremersch 2004; Meade and Islam 2006; Peres et al. 2010).
Diffusion rates are determined by two broad categories of variables: 
those intrinsic to the technology, product or practice under consideration 
(typically performance, costs, benefits), and those intrinsic to the 
adoption environment (e.g., socio-economic and market characteristics).
Despite differences, the literature offers three robust conclusions 
on acceleration (high evidence, high agreement): First, size matters. 
Acceleration of transitions is more difficult for social, economic, or 
technological systems of larger size (in terms of number of users, 
financial investments, infrastructure, powerful industries) (Wilson 
2009; Wilson 2012). Size also matters at the level of the systems 
component involved in a  transition. Components with smaller 
unit-scale (‘granular’ and thus relatively cheap), such as light 
bulbs or household appliances, turn over much faster (often within 
a decade) than large-scale, capital-intensive lumpy technologies and 
infrastructures (such as transport systems) where rates of change 
typically involve several decades, even up to a century (Grubler 1991; 
Leibowicz 2018). Also, the creation of entirely new systems (diffusion) 
takes longer time than replacements of existing technologies or 
practices (substitution) (Grübler et al. 1999); and late adopters tend 
to adopt faster than early pioneers (Wilson 2012; Grubler 1996).
Arguments about scale in the energy system date back at least to 
the 1970s when Schumacher, Lovins and others argued the case for 
smaller-scale, distributed technologies (Schumacher 1974; Lovins 
1976; Lovins 1979). In Small is Profitable Lovins and colleagues 
evidenced over 200 reasons why decentralised energy resources, from 
distributed generation to end-use efficiency, made good business 
sense in addition to their social, human-centred benefits (Lovins et al. 
2003). More recent advances in digital, solar and energy storage 
technologies have renewed technical and economic arguments in 
favour of adopting decentralised approaches to decarbonisation 
(Cook et al. 2016; Jain et al. 2017; Lovins et al. 2018). Smaller-scale 
technologies from microprocessors to solar panels show dramatically 
faster cost and performance improvement trajectories than large-scale 
energy supply facilities (Trancik 2014; Sweerts et al. 2020, Creutzig 
et al. 2021) (Figure 5.15). Analysing the performance of over 80 energy 
technologies historically, Wilson et al. (2020a) found that smaller scale, 
more ‘granular’ technologies are empirically associated with faster 
diffusion, lower investment risk, faster learning, more opportunities to 
escape lock-in, more equitable access, more job creation, and higher 
social returns on innovation investment. These advantages of more 
granular technologies are consistent with accelerated low-carbon 
transformation (Wilson et al. 2020a).
Second, complexity matters, which is often related to unit scale (Ma et al. 
2008). Acceleration is more difficult for options with higher degrees of 
complexity (e.g., carbon capture, transport and storage, or a hydrogen 
economy) representing higher technological and investment risks that 
accelerate because they involve less experimentation and debugging 
and require less adoption efforts and risk.
Third, agency, structure and meaning can accelerate transitions. 
The creation and mobilisation of actor coalitions is widely seen as 
important for acceleration, especially if these involve actors with 
technical skills, financial resources and political capital (Kern and 
Rogge 2016; Hess 2019b; Roberts and Geels 2019). Changes in policies and institutions can also accelerate transitions, especially if 
these create stable and attractive financial incentives or introduce 
technology-forcing standards or regulations (Brand et al. 2013; Kester 
et al. 2018; Roberts et al. 2018). Changes in meanings and cultural 
norms can also accelerate transitions, especially when they affect 
consumer practices, enhance social acceptance, and create legitimacy 
for stronger policy support (Lounsbury and Glynn 2001; Rogers 2003; 
Buschmann and Oels 2019). Adoption of most advanced practices 
can support leapfrogging of polluting technologies (Box 5.9).

Box 5.9 | Is Leapfrogging Possible?
The concept of leapfrogging emerged in development economics (Soete 1985), energy policy (Goldemberg 1991) and environmental 
regulation (Perkins 2003, which provides a  first critical review of the concept), and refers to a  development strategy that skips 
traditional and polluting development in favour of the most advanced concepts. For instance, in rural areas without telephone 
landlines or electricity access (cables), a direct shift to mobile telephony or distributed, locally-sourced energy systems is promoted, or 
economic development policies for pre-industrial economies forego the traditional initial emphasis on heavy industry industrialisation, 
instead focusing on services like finance or tourism. Often leapfrogging is enabled by learning and innovation externalities where 
improved knowledge and technologies become available for late adopters at low costs. The literature highlights many cases of 
successful leapfrogging but also highlights limitations (Watson and Sauter 2011); with example case studies for China (Gallagher 
2006; Chen and Li-Hua 2011); Mexico (Gallagher and Zarsky 2007); and Japan and Korea (Cho et al. 1998). Increasingly the concept 
is being integrated into the literature of low-carbon development, including innovation and technology transfer policies (Pigato et al. 
2020), highlighting in particular the importance of contextual factors of successful technology transfer and leapfrogging including: 
domestic absorptive capacity and technological capabilities (Cirera and Maloney 2017); human capital, skills, and relevant technical 
know-how (Nelson and Phelps 1966); the size of the market (Keller 2004); greater openness to trade (Sachs and Warner 1995; Keller 
2004); geographical proximity to investors and financing (Comin et al. 2012); environmental regulatory proximity (Dechezleprêtre 
et al. 2015); and stronger protection of intellectual property rights (Dechezleprêtre et al. 2013; Dussaux et al. 2017). The existence 
of a technological potential for leapfrogging therefore needs to be considered within a wider context of social, institutional, and 
economic factors that influence whether leapfrogging potentials can be realised (high evidence, high agreement).
low-carbon transitions. First, while acceleration is desirable to 
mitigate climate change, there is a  risk that accelerating change 
too much may short-cut crucial experimentation and social and 
technological learning in ‘formative phases’ (Bento 2013; Bento et al. 
2018b) and potentially lead to a pre-mature lock-in of solutions that 
later turn out to have negative impacts (Cowan 1990; Cowan 1991) 
(high evidence, medium agreement).
Second, there is an ongoing debate about the most powerful leverage 
points and policies for speeding up change in social and technological 
systems. Farmer et  al. (2019) suggested ‘sensitive intervention 
points’ for low-carbon transitions, but do not quantify the impacts 
on transformations. Grubler et al. (2018) proposed an end-user and 
efficiency-focused strategy to achieve rapid emission reductions 
and quantified their scenario with a leading IAM. However, discussion 
of the policy implications of such a  strategy have only just started 
(Wilson et al. 2019a), suggesting an important area for future research.
The last contentious issue is if policies can or should substitute for 
lack of economic or social appeal of change or for technological risks. 
Many large-scale supply-side climate mitigation options, such as CCS 
or nuclear power, involve high technological risks, critically depend 
on a stable carbon price, and are controversial in terms of social and 
environmental impacts (Sovacool et al. 2014; Smith et al. 2016; Wilson 
et al. 2020a) (high evidence,  medium agreement). There is continuing 
debate if and how policies could counterbalance these impacts in 
order to accelerate transitions (Nordhaus 2019; Lovins 2015). Some 
demand-side options like large-scale public transport infrastructures 
such as ‘Hyperloop’ (Decker et al. 2017) or concepts such as the Asian 
Super Grid (maglev fast train coupled with superconducting electricity 
transmission networks) (AIGC 2017) may face similar challenges, which 
adds weight and robustness to those demand-side options that are 
more decentralised, granular in scale, and provide potential tangible 
consumer benefits besides being low-carbon (like more efficient 
buildings and appliances, ‘soft’ urban mobility options (walking and 
cycling), digitalisation, among others (Grubler et al. 2018)).A robust conclusion from this review is that there are no generic 
acceleration policies that are independent from the nature of 
what changes, by whom and how. Greater contextualisation and 
granularity in policy approaches is therefore important to address 
the challenges of rapid transitions towards zero-carbon systems 
(high evidence, high agreement).
5.6 Governance and Policy
5.6.1 Governing Mitigation: Participation 
and Social Trust
In demand-side mitigation, governance is key to drive the 
multidimensional changes needed to meet service needs within 
a society that provide people with a decent living while increasingly 
reducing resource and energy input levels (Rojas-Rueda et  al. 2012; 
Batchelor et al. 2018; OECD 2019a). Impartial governance, understood 
as equal treatment of everyone by the rule of law, creates social trust 
and is thus a  key enabler of inclusive and participatory demand-
side climate policies (Rothstein 2011). Inclusive and broad-based 
participation itself also leads to greater social trust and thus is also 
a key enabler of demand-side climate mitigation (Section 5.2). Higher 
social trust and inclusive participatory processes also reduce inequality, 
restrain opportunistic behaviour and enhance cooperation (Drews and 
van den Bergh 2016; Gür 2020) (Section 5.2). Altogether, broad-based 
participatory processes are central to the successful implementation of 
climate policies (Rothstein and Teorell 2008; Klenert et al. 2018) (high 
evidence, medium agreement). A culture of cooperation feeds back to 
increase social trust and enables action that reduce GHG emissions 
(Carattini et al. 2015; Jo and Carattini 2021), and requires including 
explicit consideration of the informal sector (Box 5.10). More equitable 
societies also have the institutional flexibility to allow for mitigation 
to advance faster, given their readiness to adopt locally-appropriate 
mitigation policies; they also suffer less from policy lock-in (Tanner 
et al. 2009; Lorenz 2013; Chu 2015; Cloutier et al. 2015; Martin 2016; 
Seto et al. 2016; Vandeweerdt et al. 2016; Turnheim et al. 2018).
Box 5.10 | The Informal Sector and Climate Mitigation
The informal economy represents a large and growing portion of socio-economic activities (Charmes 2016; Muchie et al. 2016; Mbaye 
and Gueye 2018), including much of the work done by women worldwide. It accounts for an estimated 61% of global employment 
in the world; 90% in developing countries, 67% in emerging countries, and 18% in developed countries (Berik 2018), representing 
roughly 30% of GDP across a range of countries (Durán Heras 2012; Narayan 2017). Due to its importance, policies which support 
informal-sector climate mitigation activities may be extremely efficient (Garland 2015). For example, environmental and energy taxes 
may have negative gross costs when the informal sector dominates economic activity since these taxes indirectly tax the informal 
sector; informal production may substitute for energy-intensive goods, with strong welfare-enhancing effects (Bento et al. 2018a). The 
informal sector can assemble social and financial capital, create jobs, and build low-carbon local economies (Ruzek 2015). Constraints 
on small and informal-sector firms’ ability to build climate resilience include financial and data barriers, limited access to information 
technology, and policy exclusion (Kraemer-Mbula and Wunsch-Vincent 2016; Crick et al. 2018a; Crick et al. 2018b).
Informal-sector innovation is often underrated. It gives marginalised people access to welfare-enhancing innovations, building on 
alternative knowledge and socially-embedded reciprocal exchange (Jaffe and Koster 2019; Sheikh 2019; Sheikh and Bhaduri 2020). 
Large improvements in low-emission, locally-appropriate service provision are possible by facilitating informal-sector service providers’
There is high untapped potential of demand-side mitigation options 
if considered holistically within the domains of Avoid-Shift-Improve 
(Sections 5.3 and 5.4, Tables 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3a,b). Within the demand-
side mitigation options opportunity space, policies currently focus 
more on efficiency and ‘Improve’ options and relatively less on 
‘Shift’ and ‘Avoid’ options (Dubois et al. 2019; Moberg et al. 2019). 
Current demand-side policies are fragmented, piecemeal and too 
weak to drive demand-side transitions commensurate with 1.5°C or 
2°C climate goals (Wilson et al. 2012; Fawcett et al. 2019; Mundaca 
et  al. 2019; Moberg et  al. 2019) (high evidence, high agreement). 
However, increasingly policy mix in a number of countries has seen 
a rise in prohibitions on fossil fuel use as a way to weaken lock-ins, 
for example, on fossil fuel heating in favour of low-carbon alternatives 
(Rosenbloom et al. 2020). Policies that are aimed at behaviour and 
lifestyle changes carry a perception of political risks for policymakers, 
which may explain why policy instruments focus more on information 
provision and adoption of incentives than on regulation and investment 
(Rosenow et al. 2017; Moberg et al. 2019). Acceleration of demand-
side transitions would thus require both a broadening of demand-side 
options and the creation of comprehensive and targeted policy mixes 
(Kern et al. 2017; Rosenow et al. 2017; IPCC 2018) that strengthen the 
five drivers of decision and action identified in Section 5.4, Table 5.4 
and in Tables 5.5–5.7 (high evidence, high agreement). Demand-side 
transitions in developing and emerging economies would also require 
stronger administrative capacity as well as technical and financial 
support (UN-Habitat 2013; Creutzig et al. 2016b).
Systematic categorisation of demand-side policy options in different 
sectors and services through the Avoid-Shift-Improve framework 
enables identification of major entry points and possible associated social struggles to overcome for the policy instruments/interventions 
as discussed below.
5.6.2.1 ‘Avoid’ Policies
There is high evidence and high agreement that ‘Avoid’ policies 
that affect lifestyle changes offer opportunities for cost-effective 
reductions in energy use and emissions, but would need to overcome 
political sensitivities around government efforts to shape and modify 
individual-level behaviour (Rosenow et al. 2017; Grubb et al. 2020) 
(Table 5.5). These policies include ways to help avoid travel growth 
through integrated city planning or building retrofits to help avoid 
demand for transport, heating or cooling (Bakker et al. 2014; Lucon 
et  al. 2014; de Feijter et  al. 2019), which interact with existing 
infrastructure. Dense pedestrianised cities and towns and medium-
density transit corridors are better placed to implement policies for 
car reductions than ‘sprawled’ cities characterised by low-density, 
auto-dependent and separated land uses (Seto et al. 2014; Newman 
and Kenworthy 2015; Newman et al. 2017; Bakker et al. 2014).
Cities face pressing priorities like poverty reduction, meeting basic 
services and building human and institutional capacity. These are met 
with highly accessible walkable and cyclable cities, connected with 
public transit corridors, enabling equal accessibility for all citizens, 
and enabling a high level of service provisioning (UN-Habitat 2013; 
Creutzig et al. 2016b). Infrastructure development costs less than for 
car dependent cities. However, it requires a mindset shift for urban 
and transport planners (medium evidence, high agreement).
Policies that support the avoidance of higher-emission lifestyles 
and improve well-being are facilitated by the introduction of smart 
technologies, infrastructures and practices (Amini et al. 2019). They Box 5.10 (continued)
access to low-energy technologies (while taking care not to additionally burden the unpaid and marginalised), through such means 
as education, participatory governance, government policies to assist the informal sector, social services, health care, credit provision, 
and removing harmful policies and regulatory silos. The importance of the informal economy, especially in low-income countries, 
opens many possibilities for new approaches to decent living standards service provision along with climate resilience (Rynikiewicz 
and Chetaille 2006; Backstränd et al. 2010; Porio 2011; Kriegler et al. 2014; Taylor and Peter 2014; Brown and McGranahan 2016; 
Chu 2016; Satterthwaite et al. 2018; Boran 2019; Hugo and du Plessis 2019; Schröder et al. 2019; Javaid et al. 2020).
Public information and understanding of the CO 2-eq emissions implied by consumption patterns can unleash great creativity for meeting 
service needs fairly and with lower emissions (Darier and Schüle 1999; Sterman and Sweeney 2002; Lorenzoni et al. 2007; Billett 2010; 
Marres 2011; Zapico Lamela et al. 2011; Polonsky et al. 2012; Williams et al. 2019). Community-based mapping, social learning, green 
infrastructure development, and participatory governance facilitate such information-sharing (Tauhid and Zawani 2018; Mazeka et al. 
2019; Sharifi 2020), strengthening mitigation policies (Loiter and Norberg-Bohm 1999; Stokes and Warshaw 2017; Zhou et al. 2019).
Since informal settlements are usually dense, upgrading them supports low-carbon development pathways which leapfrog less-efficient 
housing, transport and other service provision, using locally-appropriate innovations (Satterthwaite et al. 2018). Examples of informal-
sector mitigation include digital banking in Africa; mobility in India using collective transport; food production, meal provision, and 
reduction of food waste in Latin America (e.g., soup kitchens in Brazil, community kitchens in Lima, Peru); informal materials recycling, 
space heating and cooling, and illumination (Hordijk 2000; Baldez 2003; Maumbe 2006; Gutberlet 2008; Chaturvedi and Gidwani 
2011; Nandy et al. 2015; Rouse and Verhoef 2016; Ackah 2017).
infrastructure and regulations to restrict number plates, as well as 
company policy around flexible working conditions (Lachapelle et al. 
2018; Shabanpour et  al. 2018). Working-from-home arrangements 
may advantage certain segments of society such as male, older, 
higher-educated and highly-paid employees, potentially exacerbating 
existing inequalities in the labour market (Lambert et  al. 2020; Bonacini et al. 2021). In the absence of distributive or other equity-
based measures, the potential gains in terms of emissions reduction 
may therefore be counteracted by the cost of increasing inequality. 
This potential growth in inequality is likely to be more severe in poorer 
countries that will additionally suffer from a  lack of international 
funding for achieving the SDGs (high evidence, medium agreement) 
(Barbier and Burgess 2020; UN 2020).

for providers of electric vehicle sharing services (Jung and Koo 2018)
5.6.2.2 ‘Shift’ Policies
As indicated in Table  5.6, ‘Shift’ policies have various forms 
such as the demand for low-carbon materials for buildings and 
infrastructure in manufacturing and services and shift from meat-
based protein, mainly beef, to plant-based diets of other protein 
sources (high evidence, high agreement) (Springmann et al. 2016a; Ritchie et al. 2018; Willett et al. 2019). Governments also play a direct 
role beyond nudging citizens with information about health and well-
being. While the effectiveness of these policies on behaviour change 
overall may be limited (Pearson-Stuttard et al. 2017; Shangguan et al. 
2019), there is some room for policy to influence actors upstream, 
such as industry and supermarkets, which may give rise to longer-
term, structural change.

market-based and command-and-control measures have been 
implemented to persuade large numbers of people to get out 
of their automobiles and take up public transport and cycling 
alternatives (Gehl et  al. 2011). Congestion charges are often 
complemented by other measures, such as company subsidies for 
bicycles, to incentivise the shift to public mobility services. Attracting 
people to public transport requires sufficient spatial coverage of 
transport with adequate level of provision, and good quality service 
at affordable fares (Sims et  al. 2014; Moberg et  al. 2019) (high 
evidence, high agreement). Cities such as Bogota, Colombia, Buenos 
Aires, Argentina, and Santiago, Chile, have seen rapid growth 
of cycling, resulting in a  six-fold increase in cyclists (Pucher and 
Buehler 2017). Broadly, the history and type of city determines how 
quickly the transition to public modes of transport can be achieved. 
For example, cities in developed countries enjoy an advantage in 
that there is a network of high-quality public transport predating the 
advent of automobiles, whereas cities in less developed countries 
are latecomers to large-scale network infrastructure (UN-Habitat 
2013; Gota et al. 2019).
5.6.2.3 ‘Improve’ Policies
‘Improve’ policies focus on the efficiency and enhancement of 
technological performance of services (Table 5.7). In mobility services, ‘Improve’ policies aim at improving vehicles, comfort, fuels, transport 
operations and management technologies; and in buildings, they 
include policies for improving efficiency of heating systems and 
retrofitting existing buildings. Efficiency improvements in electric 
cooking appliances, together with the ongoing decrease in prices of 
renewable energy technologies, are opening policy opportunities to 
support households to adopt electrical cooking at mass scale (medium 
evidence, medium agreement) (IEA 2017c; Puzzolo et  al. 2019). 
These actions towards cleaner energy for cooking often come with 
cooking-related reduction of GHG emissions, even though the extent 
of the reductions is highly dependent on context and technology and 
fuel pathways (high evidence, high agreement) (Martínez et al. 2017; 
Mondal et  al. 2018; Rosenthal et  al. 2018; Serrano-Medrano et  al. 
2018; Dagnachew et al. 2019) (Box 5.6).
Table  5.7 highlights the significant progress made in the uptake of 
the electrical vehicle (EV) in Europe, driven by a  suite of incentives 
and policies. Increased activity in widening electric vehicle use is also 
occurring in developing countries. The Indian Government’s proposal to 
reach the target of a 100% electric vehicle fleet by 2030 has stimulated 
investment in charging infrastructure that can facilitate diffusion of 
larger EVs (Dhar et al. 2017). Although the proposal was not converted 
into a  policy, India’s large and growing two-wheeler market has 
benefitted from the policy attention on EVs, showing a  significant 
potential for increasing the share of electric two- and three-wheelers

In recent years, policy interest has arisen to address the energy access 
challenge in Africa using low-carbon energy technologies to meet 
energy for poverty reduction and climate action simultaneously 
(Rolffs et al. 2015; Fuso Nerini et al. 2018; Mulugetta et al. 2019). This 
aspiration has been bolstered on the technical front by significant 
advances in appliance efficiency such as light-emitting diode (LED) 
technology, complemented by the sharp reduction in the cost of 
renewable energy technologies, and largely driven by market-
stimulating policies and public R&D to mitigate risks (high evidence, 
high agreement) (Alstone et al. 2015; Zubi et al. 2019).
5.6.3 Policies in Transition Phases
Demand-side policies tend to vary for different transition phases 
(high evidence, high agreement) (Roberts and Geels 2019; Sandin et  al. 2019). In the first phase, which is characterised by the 
emergence or introduction of radical innovations in small niches, 
policies focus on: (i) supporting R&D and demonstration projects 
to enable learning and capability developments, (ii) nurturing 
the building of networks and  multi-stakeholder interactions, and 
(iii)  providing future orientation through visions or targets (Brown 
et  al. 2003; López-García et  al. 2019; Roesler and Hassler 2019). 
In the second phase, the policy emphasis shifts towards upscaling 
of experiments, standardisation, cost reduction, and the creation 
of early market niches (Borghei and Magnusson 2018; Ruggiero et al. 
2018). In  the third and later phases, comprehensive policy mixes 
are used to stimulate mass adoption, infrastructure creation, social 
acceptance and business investment (Fichter and Clausen 2016; 
Geels et al. 2018; Strauch 2020). In the fourth phase, transitions can 
also be stimulated through policies that weaken or phase out existing 
regimes, such as removing inefficient subsidies (for cheap petrol or 
fuel oil) that encourage wasteful consumption, increasing taxes on 
carbon-intensive products and practices (Box 5.11), or substantially 
tightening regulations and standards (Kivimaa and Kern 2016; David 
2017; Rogge and Johnstone 2017).
Box 5.11 | Carbon Pricing and Fairness
Whether the public supports specific policy instruments for reducing greenhouse gas emissions is determined by cultural and political 
world views (Cherry et al. 2017; Kotchen et al. 2017; Alberini et al. 2018) and national positions in international climate negotiations, 
with major implications for policy design. For example, policy proposals need to circumvent ‘solution aversion’: that is, individuals are 
more doubtful about the urgency of climate change mitigation if the proposed policy contradicts their political worldviews (Campbell 
and Kay 2014). While there are reasons to believe that carbon pricing is the most efficient way to reduce emissions, a recent literature – 
focusing on populations in Western Europe and North America and carbon taxes – documents that efficiency features alone is not 
what makes citizens like or dislike carbon pricing schemes (Kallbekken et al. 2011; Carattini et al. 2017; Klenert et al. 2018).
Citizens tend to ignore or doubt the idea that pricing carbon emissions reduces GHG emissions (Kallbekken et al. 2011; Douenne 
and Fabre 2019; Maestre-Andrés et  al. 2019). Further, citizens have fairness concerns about carbon pricing (Büchs and Schnepf 
2013; Douenne and Fabre 2019; Maestre-Andrés et al. 2019), even if higher carbon prices can be made progressive by suitable use 
of revenues (Rausch et al. 2011; Williams et al. 2015; Klenert and Mattauch 2016). There are also non-economic properties of policy 
instruments that matter for public support: Calling a carbon price a ‘CO 2 levy’ alleviates solution aversion (Kallbekken et al. 2011; 
Carattini et al. 2017). It may be that the word ‘tax’ evokes a feeling of distrust in government and fears of high costs, low benefits 
and distributional effects (Strand 2020). Trust in politicians is negatively correlated with higher carbon prices (Hammar and Jagers 
2006; Rafaty 2018) and political campaigns for a carbon tax can lower public support for them (Anderson et al. 2019). Few developing 
countries have adopted carbon taxes, probably due to high costs, relatively low benefits, and distributional effects (Strand 2020).
To address these realities regarding support for carbon pricing, some studies have examined whether specific uses of the revenue 
can increase public support for higher carbon prices (Carattini et al. 2017; Beiser-McGrath and Bernauer 2019). Doubt about the 
environmental effectiveness of carbon pricing may be alleviated if revenue from carbon pricing is earmarked for specific uses 
(Kallbekken et al. 2011; Carattini et al. 2017) and higher carbon prices may then be supported (Beiser-McGrath and Bernauer 2019). 
This is especially the case for using the proceeds on ‘green investment’ in infrastructure or energy efficiency programmes (Kotchen 
et al. 2017). Further, returning the revenues to individuals in a salient manner may increase public support and alleviate fairness 
proposals, given sufficient information (Carattini et al. 2017; Klenert et al. 2018). Perceived fairness is one of the strongest predictors 
of policy support (Jagers et al. 2010; Whittle et al. 2019).
to Strengthen Enabling Conditions
Policy coordination is critical to manage infrastructure interdependence 
across sectors, and to avoid trade-off effects (Raven and Verbong 2007; 
Hiteva and Watson 2019), specifically requiring the consideration of 
interactions among supply-side and demand-side measures (high 
evidence,  high agreement) (Kivimaa and Virkamäki 2014; Rogge and 
Reichardt 2016; de Coninck et al. 2018; Edmondson et al. 2019). For 
example, the amount of electricity required for cooking can overwhelm 
the grid which can lead to failure, causing end-users to shift back to 
traditional biomass or fossil fuels (Ateba et al. 2018; Israel-Akinbo et al. 
2018); thus grid stability policies need to be undertaken in conjunction.
Policymakers operate in a  politically dynamic national and 
international environment, and their policies often reflect their 
contextual situations and constraints with regards to climate-related 
reforms (Levin et al. 2012; Copland 2019), including differentiation 
between developed and developing countries (high evidence, high 
agreement) (Beer and Beer 2014; Roy et al. 2018c). Variables such 
as internal political stability, equity, informality (Box 5.10), macro-
economic conditions, public debt, governance of policies, global 
oil prices, quality of public services, and the maturity of green 
technologies play important roles in determining policy directions.
Sequencing policies appropriately is a  success factor for climate 
policy regimes (high evidence,  high agreement). In most situations 
policy measures require a preparatory phase that prepares the ground 
by lowering the costs of policies, communicating the costs and 
benefits to citizens, and building coalitions for policies, thus reducing 
political resistance (Meckling et  al. 2017). This policy sequencing 
aims to incrementally relax or remove barriers over time to enable 
significant cumulative increases in policy stringency and create 
coalitions that support future policy development (Pahle et al. 2018). 
German policies on renewables began with funding for research, 
design and development (RD&D), then subsidies for demonstration 
projects during the 1970s and 1980s, and continued to larger-scale 
projects such as ‘Solar Roofs’ programmes in the 1990s, including 
scaled-up feed-in tariffs for solar power (Jacobsson and Lauber 2006). 
These policies led to industrial expansion in wind and solar energy 
systems, giving rise to powerful renewables interest coalitions that 
defend existing measures and lend political support for further action. 
Policy sequencing has also been deployed to introduce technology 
bans and strict performance standards with a  view to eliminating 
emissions as the end goal, and may involve simultaneous support 
for low-carbon options while deliberately phasing out established 
technological regimes (Rogge and Johnstone 2017).
As a key contending policy instrument, carbon pricing also requires 
embedding into policy packages (high evidence,  medium agreement) . 
Pricing may be regressive and perceived as additional costs by 
households and industry, making investments in green infrastructure 
politically unfeasible, as examples from France and Australia show 
(Copland 2019; Douenne and Fabre 2020). Reforms that would 
push up household energy expenses are often left aside for fear of 
how citizens, especially the poor, would react or cope with higher 
bills (high evidence,  medium agreement) (Martinez and Viegas 2017; Tesfamichael et al. 2021). This makes it important to precede 
carbon pricing with investments in renewable energy and low-
carbon transport modes (Biber et al. 2017; Tvinnereim and Mehling 
2018), and especially support for developing countries by building up 
low-carbon energy and mobility infrastructures and technologies, thus 
reducing resistance to carbon pricing (Creutzig 2019). Additionally, 
carbon pricing receives higher acceptance if fairness and distributive 
considerations are made explicit in revenue distribution (Box 5.11).
The effectiveness of a policy package is determined by design decisions 
as well as the wider governance context that include the political 
environment, institutions for coordination across scales, bureaucratic 
traditions, and judicial functioning (high evidence,  high agreement) 
(Howlett and Rayner 2013; Rogge and Reichardt 2013; Rosenow et al. 
2016). Policy packages often emerge through interactions between 
different policy instruments as they operate in either complementary 
or contradictory ways, resulting from conflicting policy goals 
(Cunningham et al. 2013; Givoni et al. 2013). An example includes the 
acceleration in shift from traditional biomass to the adoption of modern 
cooking fuel for 80 million households in rural India over a very short 
period of four years (2016–2020), which employed a comprehensive 
policy package including financial incentives, infrastructural support 
and strengthening of the supply chain to induce households to shift 
towards a clean cooking fuel from the use of biomass (Kumar 2019). 
This was operationalised by creating a LPG supply chain by linking 
oil and gas companies with distributors to assure availability, and 
create infrastructure for local storage along with an improvement of 
the rural road network, especially in the rural context (Sankhyayan 
and Dasgupta 2019). State governments initiated separate policies to 
increase the distributorship of LPG in their states (Kumar et al. 2016). 
Similarly, policy actions for scaling up electric vehicles need to be 
well designed and coordinated where EV policy, transport policy and 
climate policy are used together, working on different decision points 
and different aspects of human behaviour (Barton and Schütte 2017). 
The coordination of the multiple policy actions enables co-evolution 
of multiple outcomes that involve shifting towards renewable energy 
production, improving access to charging infrastructure, carbon 
pricing and other GHG measures (Wolbertus et al. 2018).
Design of policy packages should consider not only policies that 
support low-carbon transitions but also those that challenge existing 
carbon-intensive regimes, generating not just policy ‘winners’ but 
also ‘losers’ (high evidence, high agreement) (Carley and Konisky 
2020). The winners include low-carbon innovators and entrepreneurs, 
while the potential losers include incumbents with vested interests 
in sustaining the status quo (Mundaca et al. 2018; Monasterolo and 
Raberto 2019). Low-carbon policy packages would benefit from 
looking beyond climate benefits to include non-climate benefits 
such as health benefits, fuel poverty reductions and environmental 
co-benefits (Ürge-Vorsatz et  al. 2014; Sovacool et  al. 2020b). The 
uptake of decentralised energy services using solar PV in rural 
areas in developing countries is one such example where successful 
initiatives are linked to the convergence of multiple policies that 
include import tariffs, research incentives for R&D, job creation 
programmes, policies to widen health and education services, and 
strategies for increased safety for women and children (Kattumuri 
and Kruse 2019; Gebreslassie 2020).
case of the formation of policy coalitions that led to the development of 
policy packages. As attention to energy efficiency in Europe increased 
in the 1990s, policymakers attempted to stimulate energy-saving 
lamp diffusion through voluntary measures. But policies stimulated 
only limited adoption. Consumers perceived compact fluorescent 
lamps (CFLs) as giving ‘cold’ light, being unattractively shaped, taking 
too long to achieve full brightness, unsuitable for many fixtures, and 
unreliable (Wall and Crosbie 2009). Still, innovations by major CFL 
and LED multinationals continued. Increasing political attention to 
climate change and criticisms from environmental NGOs (e.g. WWF , 
Greenpeace) strengthened awareness about the inefficiency of 
incandescent light bulbs (ILBs), which led to negative socio-cultural 
framings that associated ILBs  with energy waste (Franceschini and 
Alkemade 2016). The combined pressures from the lighting industry, 
NGOs and member states led the European Commission to introduce 
the 2009 ban of ILBs of more than 80W, progressing to lower-wattage 
bans in successive years. While the ILB ban initially mainly boosted 
CFL diffusion, it also stimulated LED uptake. LED prices decreased 
quickly by more than 85% between 2008 and 2012 (Sanderson 
and Simons 2014), because of scale economies, standardisation 
and commoditisation of LED chip technology, and improved 
manufacturing techniques. Because of further rapid developments to 
meet consumer tastes, LEDs came to be seen as the future of domestic 
lighting (Franceschini et  al. 2018). Acknowledging these changing 
views, the 2016 and 2018 European bans on directional and non-
directional halogen bulbs explicitly intended to further accelerate the 
LED transition and reduce energy consumption for residential lighting.
In summary, more equitable societies are associated with high levels 
of social trust and enable actions that reduce GHG emissions. To this 
end, people play an important role in the delivery of demand-side 
mitigation options within which efficiency and ‘Improve’ options 
dominate. Policies that are aimed at behaviour and lifestyle changes 
come with political risks for policymakers. However, the potential 
exists for broadening demand-side interventions to include ‘Avoid’ 
and ‘Shift’ policies. Longer term thinking and implementation that 
involves careful sequencing of policies as well as designing policy 
packages that address multiple co-benefits would be critical to 
manage interactions among supply-side and demand-side options 
to accelerate mitigation.
5.7 Knowledge Gaps
Knowledge gap 1: Better metric to measure actual 
human well-being
Knowledge on climate action that starts with the social practices 
and how people live in various environments, cultures, contexts and 
attempts to improve their well-being, is still in its infancy. In models, 
climate solutions remain supply-side oriented, and evaluated against 
GDP , without acknowledging the reduction in  well-being  due 
to  climate impacts. GDP is a  poor metric of human well-being, 
and climate policy evaluation requires better grounding in relation 
to decent living standards and/or similar benchmarks. Actual 
solutions will invariably include demand, service provisioning and end use. Literature on how gender, informal economies mostly in 
developing countries, and solidarity and care frameworks translate 
into climate action, but also how climate action can improve the life 
of marginalised groups, remains scarce. The working of economic 
systems under a well-being-driven rather than GDP-driven paradigm 
requires better understanding.
Knowledge gap 2: Evaluation of climate implications 
of the digital economy
The digital economy, as well as shared and circular economy, is 
emerging as a  template for great narratives, hopes and fears. Yet, 
there are few systematic evaluations of what is already happening 
and what can govern it towards a better narrative. Research needs 
to better gauge energy trends for rapidly evolving systems like data 
centres, increased use of social media and influence of consumption 
and choices, AI, blockchain; and implications of digital divides among 
social groups and countries on well-being. Governance decisions on 
AI, indirectly fostering either climate harming or climate mitigating 
activities remain unexplored. Better integration of mitigation models 
and consequential lifecycle analysis is needed for assessing how 
digitalisation, shared economy and circular economy change material 
and energy demand.
Knowledge gap 3: Scenario modelling of services
Scenarios start within parameter-rich models carrying more than 
a  decade-long legacy of supply-side technologies that are not 
always gauged in recent technological developments. Service 
provisioning systems are not explicitly modelled, and diversity in 
concepts and patterns of lifestyles rarely considered. A new class of 
flexible and  modular models with focus on services and activities, 
based on a variety of data sources including big data collected and 
compiled, is needed. There is scope for more sensitivity analysis 
on two aspects to better guide further detailed studies on societal 
response to policy. These aspects need to explore which socio-
behavioural aspects and/or organisation changes has the biggest 
impact on energy/emissions reductions, and on the scale for take-
back effects, due to interdependence on inclusion or exclusion 
of groups of people. Models mostly consider behavioural change 
free, and don’t account for how savings due to ‘Avoid’ measures 
may be re-spent. Most quantitatively measurable service indicators, 
for example passenger-kilometres travelled or tonne-kilometres 
of freight transport are also inadequate to measure services in the 
sense of well-being contributions. More research is needed on how 
to measure, for example, accessibility, social inclusion etc. Otherwise, 
services will also be poorly represented in scenarios.
Knowledge gap 4: Dynamic interaction between 
individual, social, and structural drivers of change
Better understanding is required on: (i) more detailed causal 
mechanisms in the mutual interactions between individual, social, 
and structural drivers of change and how these vary over time, that 
(ii) how narratives associated with specific technologies, group 
identities, and climate change influence each other and interact over 
time to enable and constrain mitigation outcomes; (iii) how social 
media influences the development and impacts of narratives about 
low-carbon transitions; (iv) the effects of social movements (for 
climate justice, youth climate activism, fossil fuel divestment, and 
climate action more generally) on social norms and political change, 
especially in less developed countries; (v) how existing provisioning 
systems and social practices destabilise through the weakening of 
various lock-in mechanisms, and resulting deliberate strategies for 
accelerating demand-side transitions; (vi) a dynamic understanding 
of feasibility, which addresses the dynamic mechanisms that lower 
barriers or drive mitigation options over the barriers; (vii) how 
shocks like prolonged pandemic impact willingness and capacity to 
change and their permanency for various social actors and country 
contexts. The debate on the most powerful leverage points and 
policies for speeding up change in social and technological systems 
need to be resolved with more evidence. Discussion on the policy 
interdependence and implications of end-user and efficiency focused 
strategies have only just started suggesting an important area for 
future research.
FAQ 5.1 | What can every person do to limit warming to 1.5°C?
People can be educated through knowledge transfer so they can act in different roles, and in each role everyone can contribute to 
limit global warming to 1.5°C. Citizens with enough knowledge can organise and put political pressure on the system. Role models 
can set examples to others. Professionals (e.g., engineers, urban planners, teachers, researchers) can change professional standards 
in consistency with decarbonisation; for example urban planners and architects can design physical infrastructures to facilitate low-
carbon mobility and energy use by making walking and cycling safe for children. Rich investors can make strategic plans to divest 
from fossils and invest in carbon-neutral technologies. Consumers, especially those in the top 10% of the world population in terms 
of income, can limit consumption, especially in mobility, and explore the good life consistent with sustainable consumption.
Policymakers support individual actions in certain contexts, not only by economic incentives, such as carbon pricing, but also by 
interventions that understand complex decision-making processes, habits, and routines. Examples of such interventions include, 
but are not limited to, choice architectures and nudges that set green options as default, shift away from cheap petrol or gasoline, 
increasing taxes on carbon-intensive products, or substantially tightening regulations and standards to support shifts in social 
norms, and thus can be effective beyond the direct economic incentive.
FAQ 5.2 | How does society perceive transformative change?
Humaninduced global warming, together with other global trends and events, such as digitalisation and automation, and the 
COVID-19 pandemic, induce changes in labour markets, and bring large uncertainty and ambiguity. History and psychology reveal 
that societies can thrive in these circumstances if they openly embrace uncertainty on the future and try out ways to improve life. 
Tolerating ambiguity can be learned, for example by interacting with history, poetry and the arts. Sometimes religion and philosophy 
also help.
As a key enabler, novel narratives created in a variety of ways, such as by advertising, images and the entertainment industry, 
help to break away from the established meanings, values and discourses and the status quo. For example, discourses that frame 
comfortable public transport services to avoid stress from driving cars on busy, congested roads help avoid car driving as a status 
symbol and create a  new social norm to shift to public transport. Discourses that portray plant-based protein as healthy and 
natural promote and stabilise particular diets. Novel narratives and inclusive processes help strategies to overcome multiple barriers. 
Case studies demonstrate that citizens support transformative changes if participatory processes enable a design that meets local 
interests and culture. Promising narratives specify that even as speed and capabilities differ, humanity embarks on a joint journey 
towards well-being for all and a healthy planet.
FAQ 5.3 | Is demand reduction compatible with growth of human well-being?
There is a growing realisation that mere monetary value of income growth is insufficient to measure national welfare and individual 
well-being. Hence, any action towards climate change mitigation is best evaluated against a set of indicators that represent a broader 
variety of needs to define individual well-being, macroeconomic stability, and planetary health. Many solutions that reduce primary 
material and fossil energy demand, and thus reduce GHG emissions, provide better services to help achieve well-being for all.
Economic growth measured by total or individual income growth is a main driver of GHG emissions. Only a few countries with low 
economic growth rates have reduced both territorial and consumption-based GHG emissions, typically by switching from fossil fuels 
to renewable energy and by reduction in energy use and switching to low/zero carbon fuels, but until now at insufficient rates and 
levels for stabilising global warming at 1.5°C. High deployment of low/zero carbon fuels and associated rapid reduction in demand 
for and use of coal, gas, and oil can further reduce the interdependence between economic growth and GHG emissions.
