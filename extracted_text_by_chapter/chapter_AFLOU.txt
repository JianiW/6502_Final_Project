The Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use1 (AFOLU) sector 
encompasses managed ecosystems and offers significant 
mitigation opportunities while delivering food, wood and 
other renewable resources as well as biodiversity conservation, 
provided the sector adapts to climate change. Land-based 
mitigation measures represent some of the most important options 
currently available. They can both deliver carbon dioxide removal 
(CDR) and substitute for fossil fuels, thereby enabling emissions 
reductions in other sectors. The rapid deployment of AFOLU measures 
is essential in all pathways staying within the limits of the remaining 
budget for a  1.5°C target (high confidence). Where carefully and 
appropriately implemented, AFOLU mitigation measures are uniquely 
positioned to deliver substantial co-benefits and help address many 
of the wider challenges associated with land management. If AFOLU 
measures are deployed badly then, when taken together with the 
increasing need to produce sufficient food, feed, fuel and wood, 
they may exacerbate trade-offs with the conservation of habitats, 
adaptation, biodiversity and other services. At the same time the 
capacity of the land to support these functions may be threatened by 
climate change itself (high confidence). {IPCC AR6 WGI, Figure SPM.7; 
IPCC AR6 WGII, 7.1, 7.6}
The AFOLU (managed land) sector, on average, accounted for 
13–21% of global total anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions in the period 2010–2019 (medium confidence). At the 
same time managed and natural terrestrial ecosystems were 
a carbon sink, absorbing around one third of anthropogenic CO 2 
emissions (medium confidence). Estimated anthropogenic net 
CO2 emissions from AFOLU (based on book-keeping models) result in 
a net source of +5.9 ± 4.1 GtCO 2 yr–1 between 2010 and 2019 with 
an unclear trend. Based on FAOSTAT or national GHG inventories, 
the net CO 2 emissions from AFOLU were 0.0 to +0.8 GtCO 2 yr–1 
over the same period. There is a  discrepancy in the reported CO 2 
AFOLU emissions magnitude because alternative methodological 
approaches that incorporate different assumptions are used. If the 
managed and natural responses of all land to both anthropogenic 
environmental change and natural climate variability, estimated to 
be a  gross sink of –12.5 ± 3.2 GtCO 2 yr–1 for the period 2010–2019, 
are included with land use emissions, then land overall, constituted 
a net sink of –6.6 ± 5.2 GtCO 2 yr–1 in terms of CO 2 emissions (medium 
confidence). {7.2, 7.2.2.5, Table 7.1; IPCC AR6 WGI}
AFOLU CO 2 emissions fluxes are mainly driven by land use 
change (CO 2 LULUCF), and account for about half of total 
net AFOLU emissions. The rate of deforestation has generally 
declined, while global tree cover and global forest growing 
stock levels are likely increasing (medium confidence).
There are substantial regional differences, with losses of carbon 
generally observed in tropical regions and gains in temperate and 

reported by global book-keeping models used here differ from those from the aggregate global net emissions based on national GHG inventories. This difference, which has 
been considered in the literature, mainly reflects differences in how anthropogenic forest sinks and areas of managed land are defined. Other reasons for this difference, 
which are more difficult to quantify, can arise from the limited representation of land management in global models and varying levels of accuracy and completeness of 
estimated LULUCF fluxes in national GHG inventories. Neither method is inherently preferable. This chapter reports estimates from different databases and approaches, but 
uses CO 2 LULUCF from book-keeping models to report overall emissions to ensure consistency and comparability across chapters.boreal regions. Agricultural methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2O) 
emissions are estimated to average 157 ± 47.1 MtCH 4 yr–1 and 
6.6  ± 4.0 MtN 2O yr–1 or 4.2 ± 1.3 and 1.8 ± 1.1 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 
(using IPCC AR6 GWP100 values for CH 4 and N 2O) respectively 
between 2010 and 2019. AFOLU CH 4 emissions continue to increase 
(high confidence), the main source of which is enteric fermentation 
from ruminant animals (high confidence). Similarly, AFOLU N 2O 
emissions are increasing, dominated by agriculture, notably from 
manure application, nitrogen deposition, and nitrogen fertiliser use 
(high confidence). In addition to being a source and sink for GHG 
emissions, land plays an important role in climate through albedo 
effects, evapotranspiration and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) 
and their mix, although the combined role in total climate forcing is 
unclear and varies strongly with bioclimatic region and management 
type. {2.4.2.5, 7.2, 7.2.1, 7.2.3, 7.3}
The AFOLU sector offers significant near-term mitigation 
potential at relatively low cost but cannot compensate for 
delayed emission reductions in other sectors (high evidence, 
medium agreement). The AFOLU sector can provide 20–30% 
(interquartile range) of the global mitigation needed for a 1.5°C or 
2°C pathway towards 2050 (robust evidence, medium agreement), 
though there are highly variable mitigation strategies for how AFOLU 
potential can be deployed for achieving climate targets. The estimated 
likely economic (<USD100 tCO 2-eq–1) AFOLU sector mitigation 
potential is 8 to 14 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 between 2020 and 2050, with 
the bottom end of this range representing the mean from integrated 
assessment models (IAMs) and the upper end representing the mean 
estimate from global sectoral studies. The economic potential is about 
half of the technical potential from AFOLU, and about 30–50% could 
be achieved under USD20 tCO 2-eq–1. The implementation of robust 
measurement, reporting and verification processes is paramount to 
improving the transparency of net-carbon-stock changes per land 
unit to prevent misleading assumptions or claims on mitigation. 
{7.1, 7.4, 7.5}
Between 2020 and 2050, mitigation measures in forests and 
other natural ecosystems provide the largest share of the 
economic (up to USD100 tCO 2-eq–1) AFOLU mitigation potential, 
followed by agriculture and demand-side measures (high 
confidence). In the global sectoral studies, the protection, improved 
management, and restoration of forests, peatlands, coastal wetlands, 
savannas and grasslands have the potential to reduce emissions and/
or sequester 7.3 mean (3.9–13.1 range) GtCO 2-eq yr–1. Agriculture 
provides the second largest share of the mitigation potential, with 
4.1 (1.7–6.7) GtCO 2-eq yr–1 (up to USD100 tCO 2-eq–1) from cropland 
and grassland soil carbon management, agroforestry, use of biochar, 
improved rice cultivation, and livestock and nutrient management. 
Demand-side measures including shifting to sustainable healthy diets, 
reducing food waste, and building with wood and biochemicals and 
bio-textiles have a mitigation potential of 2.2 (1.1–3.6) GtCO 2-eq yr–1. 
reductions can be unlocked relatively quickly, whereas CDR needs 
upfront investment. Sustainable intensification in agriculture, shifting 
diets, and reducing food waste could enhance efficiencies and reduce 
agricultural land needs, and are therefore critical for enabling 
supply-side measures such as reforestation, restoration, as well as 
decreasing CH 4 and N 2O emissions from agricultural production. In 
addition, emerging technologies (e.g.,  vaccines or inhibitors) have 
the potential to substantially increase CH 4 mitigation potential 
beyond current estimates. AFOLU mitigation is not only relevant in 
countries with large land areas. Many smaller countries and regions, 
particularly with wetlands, have disproportionately high levels of 
AFOLU mitigation potential density. {7.4, 7.5}
The economic and political feasibility of implementing AFOLU 
mitigation measures is hampered by persistent barriers. 
Assisting countries to overcome barriers will help to achieve 
significant short-term mitigation (medium confidence). 
Finance forms a critical barrier to achieving these gains as currently 
mitigation efforts rely principally on government sources and 
funding mechanisms which do not provide sufficient resources to 
enable the economic potential to be realised. Differences in cultural 
values, governance, accountability and institutional capacity are also 
important barriers. Climate change could also emerge as a barrier to 
AFOLU mitigation, although the IPCC AR6 WGI contribution to AR6 
indicated that an increase in the capacity of natural sinks may occur, 
despite changes in climate (medium confidence). The continued loss 
of biodiversity makes ecosystems less resilient to climate change 
extremes and this may further jeopardise the achievement of the 
AFOLU mitigation potentials indicated in this chapter (IPCC AR6 WGII 
and IPBES) (high confidence). {7.4, 7.6; IPCC AR6 WGI, Figure SPM.7}
Bioenergy and other bio-based options represent an 
important share of the total mitigation potential. The range 
of recent estimates for the technical bioenergy potential 
when constrained by food security and environmental 
considerations is 5–50 and 50–250 EJ yr–1 by 2050 for residues 
and dedicated biomass production system respectively. These 
estimates fall within previously estimated ranges (medium 
agreement). Poorly planned deployment of biomass production 
and afforestation options for in-forest carbon sequestration may 
conflict with environmental and social dimensions of sustainability 
(high confidence). The global technical CDR potential of BECCS by 

underground) is estimated at 5.9 mean (0.5–11.3) GtCO 2 yr–1, of 
which 1.6 (0.8–3.5) GtCO 2 yr–1 is available at below USD100 tCO 2–1 
(medium confidence). Bioenergy and other bio-based products 
provide additional mitigation through the substitution of fossil fuels 
fossil-based products (high confidence). These substitution effects 
are reported in other sectors. Wood used in construction may reduce 
emissions associated with steel and concrete use. The agriculture 
and forestry sectors can devise management approaches that 
enable biomass production and use for energy in conjunction with 
the production of food and timber, thereby reducing the conversion 
pressure on natural ecosystems (medium confidence). {7.4}The deployment of all land-based mitigation measures can 
provide multiple co-benefits, but there are also risks and 
trade-offs from misguided or inappropriate land management 
(high confidence). Such risks can best be managed if 
AFOLU mitigation is pursued in response to the needs and 
perspectives of multiple stakeholders to achieve outcomes 
that maximise synergies while limiting trade-offs (medium 
confidence). The results of implementing AFOLU measures are 
often variable and highly context specific. Depending on local 
conditions (e.g.,  ecosystem, climate, food system, land ownership) 
and management strategies (e.g.,  scale, method), mitigation 
measures have the potential to positively or negatively impact 
biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, air quality, water availability 
and quality, soil productivity, rights infringements, food security, and 
human well-being. Mitigation measures addressing GHGs may also 
affect other climate forcers such as albedo and evapotranspiration. 
Integrated responses that contribute to mitigation, adaptation, and 
other land challenges will have greater likelihood of being successful 
(high confidence); measures which provide additional benefits to 
biodiversity and human well-being are sometimes described as 
‘Nature-Based Solutions’. {7.1, 7.4, 7.6}
AFOLU mitigation measures have been well understood 
for decades but deployment remains slow and emissions 
trends indicate unsatisfactory progress despite beneficial 
contributions to global emissions reduction from forest-
related options (high confidence). Globally, the AFOLU sector has 
so far contributed modestly to net mitigation, as past policies have 
delivered about 0.65 GtCO 2 yr–1 of mitigation during 2010–2019 
or 1.4% of global gross emissions (high confidence). The majority 
(>80%) of emission reduction resulted from forestry measures (high 
confidence). Although the mitigation potential of AFOLU measures 
is large from a biophysical and ecological perspective, its feasibility 
is hampered by lack of institutional support, uncertainty over long-
term additionality and trade-offs, weak governance, fragmented 
land ownership, and uncertain permanence effects. Despite these 
impediments to change, AFOLU mitigation options are demonstrably 
effective and with appropriate support can enable rapid emission 
reductions in most countries. {7.4, 7.6}
Concerted, rapid and sustained effort by all stakeholders, from 
policy makers and investors to land owners and managers is 
a pre-requisite to achieving high levels of mitigation in the 
AFOLU sector (high confidence). To date USD0.7 billion yr–1 is 
estimated to have been spent on AFOLU mitigation. This is well short 
of the more than USD400 billion yr–1 that is estimated to be necessary 
to deliver the up to 30% of global mitigation effort envisaged in 
deep mitigation scenarios (medium confidence). This estimate of the 
global funding requirement is smaller than current subsidies provided 
to agriculture and forestry. Making this funding available would 
require a change in flows of money and determination of who pays. 
A gradual redirection of existing agriculture and forestry subsidies 
would greatly advance mitigation. Effective policy interventions 
and national (investment) plans as part of Nationally Determined 
Contributions (NDCs), specific to local circumstances and needs, are 
options. These interventions are effective when they include funding 
schemes and long-term consistent support for implementation with 
governments taking the initiative together with private funders and 
non-state actors. {7.6}
Realising the mitigation potential of the AFOLU sector depends 
strongly on policies that directly address emissions and drive 
the deployment of land-based mitigation options, consistent 
with carbon prices in deep mitigation scenarios (high 
confidence). Examples of successful policies and measures include 
establishing and respecting tenure rights and community forestry, 
improved agricultural management and sustainable intensification, 
biodiversity conservation, payments for ecosystem services, improved 
forest management and wood chain usage, bioenergy, voluntary 
supply chain management efforts, consumer behaviour campaigns, 
private funding and joint regulatory efforts to avoid, for example, 
leakage. The efficacy of different policies, however, will depend on 
numerous region-specific factors. In addition to funding, these factors 
include governance, institutions, long-term consistent execution of 
measures, and the specific policy setting (high confidence). {7.6}
There is a discrepancy, equating to 5.5 GtCO 2 yr–1 between 
alternative methods of accounting for anthropogenic land 
CO2 fluxes. Reconciling these methods greatly enhances the 
credibility of AFOLU-based emissions offsetting. It would also 
assist in assessing collective progress in a  global stocktake 
(high confidence). The principal accounting approaches are 
national GHG inventories (NGHGI) and global modelling approaches. 
NGHGI, based on IPCC guidelines, consider a  much larger area of 
forest to be under human management than global models. NGHGI 
consider the fluxes due to human-induced environmental change on 
this area to be anthropogenic and are thus reported. Global models,2 
in contrast, consider these fluxes to be natural and are excluded from 
the total reported anthropogenic land CO 2 flux. To enable a like-with-
like comparison, the remaining cumulative global CO 2 emissions 
budget can be adjusted (medium confidence). In the absence of 
these adjustments, collective progress would appear better than it is. 
{Cross-Chapter Box 6 in this chapter, 7.2}
Addressing the many knowledge gaps in the development 
and testing of AFOLU mitigation options can rapidly advance 
the likelihood of achieving sustained mitigation (high 
confidence). Research priorities include improved quantification 
of anthropogenic and natural GHG fluxes and emissions modelling, 
better understanding of the impacts of climate change on the 
mitigation potential, permanence and additionality of estimated 
mitigation actions, and improved (real time and cheap) measurement, 
reporting and verification. There is a need to include a greater suite of 
mitigation measures in IAMs, informed by more realistic assessments 
that take into account local circumstances and socio-economic 
factors and cross-sector synergies and trade-offs. Finally, there is 
a  critical need for more targeted research to develop appropriate 
country-level, locally specific, policy and land management response 
options. These options could support more specific NDCs with 

to biodiversity conservation, ecosystem functioning, livelihoods 
for millions of farmers and foresters, and many other Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) (high confidence). {7.7}
7.1.1 Key Findings from Previous Reports
Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Uses (AFOLU) is unique due 
to its capacity to mitigate climate change through greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emission reductions, as well as enhance removals (IPCC 
2019). However, despite the attention on AFOLU since early 1990s 
it was reported in the IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and 
Land (SRCCL) as accounting for almost a quarter of anthropogenic 
emission (IPCC, 2019), with three main GHGs associated with AFOLU; 
carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2O). Overall 
emission levels had remained similar since the publication of AR4 
(Nabuurs et al. 2007). The diverse nature of the sector, its linkage 
with wider societal, ecological and environmental aspects and the 
required coordination of related policy, was suggested to make 
implementation of known and available supply- and demand-side 
mitigation measures particularly challenging (IPCC 2019). Despite 
such implementation barriers, the considerable mitigation potential 
of AFOLU as a sector on its own and its capacity to contribute to 
mitigation within other sectors was emphasised, with land-related 
measures, including bioenergy, estimated as capable of contributing 
between 20% and 60% of the total cumulative abatement to 2030 
identified within transformation pathways (IPCC 2018). However, 
the vast mitigation potential from AFOLU initially portrayed in 
literature and in Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), as explored 
in the IPCC Special Report on Climate Change of 1.5°C (SR1.5), is 
being questioned in terms of feasibility (Roe et al. 2021) and a more 
balanced perspective on the role of land in mitigation is developing, 
while at the same time, interest by private investors in land-based 
mitigation is increasing fast.
The SRCCL (IPCC 2019) outlined with medium evidence and medium 
agreement that supply-side agriculture and forestry measures 
had an economic (at USD100 tCO 2-eq–1) mitigation potential of 
7.2–10.6 GtCO 2-eq–1 in 2030 (using GWP100 and multiple IPCC values 
for CH 4 and N 2O) of which about a third was estimated as achievable at 
<USD20 tCO 2-eq–1. Agricultural measures were reported as sensitive 
to carbon price, with cropland and grazing land soil organic carbon 
management having the greatest potential at USD20 tCO 2-eq–1 and 
restoration of organic soils at USD100 tCO 2-eq–1. Forestry measures 
were less sensitive to carbon price, but varied regionally, with 
reduced deforestation, forest management and afforestation having 
the greatest potential depending on region. Although demand-side 
measures related to food could in theory make a large contribution 
to mitigation, in reality the contribution has been very small. Overall, 
the dependency of mitigation within AFOLU on a  complex range 
of factors, from population growth, economic and technological 
developments, to the sustainability of mitigation measures and 
impacts of climate change, was suggested to make realisation highly 
challenging (IPCC 2019).
Land can only be part of the solution alongside rapid emission 
reduction in other sectors (IPCC 2019). It was recognised that land 
supports many ecosystem services on which human existence, well-
being and livelihoods ultimately depend. Yet over-exploitation of land 
resources was reported as driving considerable and unprecedented rate of biodiversity loss, and wider environmental degradation (IPBES 
2019b; IPCC 2019). Urgent action to reverse this trend was deemed 
crucial in helping to accommodate the increasing demands on land 
and enhance climate change adaptation capacity. There was high 
confidence that global warming was already causing an increase in 
the frequency and intensity of extreme weather and climate events, 
impacting ecosystems, food security, disturbances and production 
processes, with existing (and new) carbon stocks in soils and biomass 
at serious risk. The impact of land cover on regional climate (through 
biophysical effects) was also highlighted, although there was no 
confidence regarding impacts on global climate.
Since the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), the share of AFOLU 
to anthropogenic GHG emissions had remained largely unchanged 
at 13–21% of total GHG emissions (medium confidence), though 
uncertainty in estimates of both sources and sinks of CO 2, 
exacerbated by difficulties in separating natural and anthropogenic 
fluxes, was emphasised. Models indicated land (including the natural 
sink) to have very likely provided a net removal of CO 2 between 2007 
and 2016. As in AR5, land cover change, notably deforestation, was 
identified as a  major driver of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions while 
agriculture was a major driver of the increasing anthropogenic CH 4 
and N 2O emissions.
In terms of mitigation, without reductions in overall anthropogenic 
emissions, increased reliance on large-scale land-based mitigation 
was predicted, which would add to the many already competing 
demands on land. However, some mitigation measures were 
suggested to not compete with other land uses, while also having 
multiple co-benefits, including adaptation capacity and potential 
synergies with some Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As 
in AR5, there was large uncertainty surrounding mitigation within 
AFOLU, in part because current carbon stocks and fluxes are unclear 
and subject to temporal variability. Additionally, the non-additive 
nature of individual measures that are often inter-linked and the highly 
context specific applicability of measures, causes further uncertainty. 
Many AFOLU measures were considered well-established and some 
achievable at low to moderate cost, yet contrasting economic drivers, 
insufficient policy, lack of incentivisation and institutional support to 
stimulate implementation among the many stakeholders involved, 
in regionally diverse contexts, was recognised as hampering 
realisation of potential.
None the less, the importance of mitigation within AFOLU was 
highlighted in all IPCC reports, with modelled scenarios demonstrating 
the considerable potential role and land-based mitigation forming an 
important component of pledged mitigation in Nationally Determined 
Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. The sector was 
identified as the only one in which large-scale carbon dioxide removal 
(CDR) may currently and at short term be possible (e.g.,  through 
afforestation/reforestation or soil organic carbon management). This 
CDR component was deemed crucial to limit climate change and its 
impacts, which would otherwise lead to enhanced release of carbon 
from land. However, the SRCCL emphasised that mitigation cannot 
be pursued in isolation. The need for integrated response options, 
that mitigate and adapt to climate change, but also deal with land 
degradation and desertification, while enhancing food and fibre 
clear (IPCC 2019; IPBES 2019a; IPBES-IPCC 2021).  
7.1.2 Boundaries, Scope and Changing Context 
of the Current Report
This chapter assesses GHG fluxes between land and the atmosphere 
due to AFOLU, the associated drivers behind these fluxes, 
mitigation response options and related policy, at time scales of 

with other sectors and therefore associated chapters within this 
report, notably concerning the provision of food, feed, fuel or fibre 
for human consumption and societal well-being (Chapter  5), for 
bioenergy (Chapter 6), the built environment (Chapter 9), transport 
(Chapter  10) and industry (Chapter  11). Mitigation within these sectors may in part, be dependent on contributions from land and 
the AFOLU sector, with interactions between all sectors discussed 
in Chapter 12. This chapter also has important links with IPCC AR6 
WGII regarding climate change impacts and adaptation. Linkages 
are illustrated in Figure 7.1.
As highlighted in both AR5 and the SRCCL, there is a  complex 
interplay between land management and GHG fluxes as illustrated in 
Figure 7.2, with considerable variation in management regionally, as 
a result of geophysical, climatic, ecological, economic, technological, 
institutional and socio-cultural diversity. The capacity for land-
based mitigation varies accordingly. The principal focus of this 
chapter is therefore, on evaluating regional land-based mitigation 
potential, identifying applicable AFOLU mitigation measures, 
estimating associated costs and exploring policy options that could 
enable implementation.

production for products and bioenergy and (iv) demand-side levers. 
Assessment is made in the context that land-mitigation is expected to 
contribute roughly 25% of the 2030 mitigation pledged in Nationally 
Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement (Grassi 
et al. 2017), yet very few countries have provided details on how this 
will be achieved. In light of AR5 and the SRCCL findings, that indicate 
large land-based mitigation potential, considerable challenges to its 
realisation, but also a clear nexus at which humankind finds itself, 
whereby current land management, driven by population growth 
and consumption patterns, is undermining the very capacity of land, 
a finite resource, to support wider critical functions and services on 
which humankind depends. Mitigation within AFOLU is occasionally 
and wrongly perceived as an opportunity for in-action within other 
sectors. AFOLU simply cannot compensate for mitigation shortfalls 
in other sectors. As the outcomes of many critical challenges (UNEP 
2019), including biodiversity loss (IPBES 2019a) and soil degradation 
(FAO and ITPS 2015), are inextricably linked with how we manage 
land, the evaluation and assessment of AFOLU is crucial. This chapter 
aims to address three core topics:
1. What is the latest estimated (economic) mitigation potential 
of AFOLU measures according to both sectoral studies and 
integrated assessment models, and how much of this may be 
realistic within each global region?
2. How do we realise the mitigation potential, while minimising 
trade-offs and risks and maximising co-benefits that can enhance 
food and fibre security, conserve biodiversity and address other 
land challenges?3. How effective have policies been so far and what additional 
policies or incentives might enable realisation of mitigation 
potential and at what costs?
This chapter first outlines the latest trends in AFOLU fluxes and 
the methodology supporting their estimation (Section  7.2). Direct 
and indirect drivers behind emission trends are discussed in 
Section 7.3. Mitigation measures, their costs, co-benefits, trade-offs, 
estimated regional potential and contribution within integrated 
global mitigation scenarios, is presented in Sections  7.4 and 7.5 
respectively. Assessment of associated policy responses and links 
with SDGs are explored in Section 7.6. The chapter concludes with 
gaps in knowledge (Section 7.7) and frequently asked questions.
7.2 Historical and Current Trends in 
GHG Emission and Removals; Their 
Uncertainties and Implications for 
Assessing Collective Climate Progress
The biosphere on land and in wetlands is a source and sink of CO 2 
and CH 4, and a source of N 2O due to both natural and anthropogenic 
processes that happen simultaneously and are therefore difficult 
to disentangle (IPCC 2010; Angelo and Du Plesis 2017; IPCC 2019). 
AFOLU is the only GHG sector to currently include anthropogenic sinks. 
A range of methodological approaches and data have been applied to 
estimating AFOLU emissions and removals, each developed for their 
own purposes, with estimates varying accordingly. Since the SRCCL (Jia 
et al. 2019), emissions estimates have been updated (Sections 7.2.2 and 
7.2.3), while the assessment of biophysical processes and short-lived

has been made on the implications of differences in AFOLU emissions 
estimates for assessing collective climate progress (Section 7.2.2.2 and 
Cross-Chapter Box 6 in this chapter).
7.2.1 Total Net GHG Flux from AFOLU
National greenhouse gas inventory (NGHGI) reporting following the 
IPCC 1996 guidelines (IPCC 1996), separates the total anthropogenic 
AFOLU flux into: (i) net anthropogenic flux from Land Use, Land-
Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF) due to both change in land 
cover and land management; and (ii) the net flux from Agriculture. 
While fluxes of CO 2 (Section 7.2.2) are predominantly from LULUCF 
and fluxes of CH 4 and N 2O (Section 7.2.3) are predominantly from 
agriculture, fluxes of all three gases are associated with both sub-
sectors. However, not all methods separate them consistently 
according to these sub-sectors, thus here we use the term AFOLU, separate by gas and implicitly include CO 2 emissions that stem from 
the agriculture part of AFOLU, though these account for a relatively 
small portion.
Total global net anthropogenic GHG emissions from AFOLU were 
11.9 ± 4.4 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 on average over the period 2010–2019, 
around 21% of total global net anthropogenic GHG emissions 
(Table 7.1 and Figure 7.3, using the sum of bookkeeping models for 
the CO 2 component). When using FAOSTAT/NGHGIs CO 2 flux data, 
then the contribution of AFOLU to total emissions amounts to 13% of 
global emissions.
This AFOLU flux is the net of anthropogenic emissions of CO 2, CH 4 and

Figure 7.3 | Subdivision of the total AFOLU emissions from Table 7.1 by activity and gas for the period 1990 to 2019.  Positive values are emissions from land 
to atmosphere, negative values are removals. Panel A shows emissions divided into major activity and gases. Note that ‘biomass burning’ is only the burning of agriculture 
residues in the fields. The indicated growth rates between 1990–2000, 2000–2010, 2010–2019 are annualised across each time period. Panel B illustrates regional emissions 
in the years 1990, 2000, 2010, 2019 AFOLU CO 2 (green shading) represents all AFOLU CO 2 emissions. It is the mean from three bookkeeping models (Hansis et al. 2015; 
Houghton and Nassikas 2017; Gasser et al. 2020) as presented in the Global Carbon Budget (Friedlingstein et al. 2020) and is not directly comparable to LULUCF in NGHGIs 
(Section 7.2.2). Data on CH 4 and N 2O emissions are from the EDGAR database (Crippa et al. 2021). See Sections 7.2.2 and 7.2.3 for comparison of different datasets. All values 
expressed are as CO 2-eq with GWP100 values: CH 4 = 27, N 2O = 273.

a Estimates are given until 2019 as this is the latest date when data are available for all gases, consistent with Chapter 2, this report. Positive fluxes are emission from land to 
the atmosphere. Negative fluxes are removals.
b Net anthropogenic flux of CO 2 are due to land-use change such as deforestation and afforestation and land management, including wood harvest and regrowth, peatland 
drainage and fires, cropland and grassland management. Average of three bookkeeping models (Hansis et al. 2015; Houghton and Nassikas 2017; Gasser et al. 2020), 
complemented by data on peatland drainage and fires from FAOSTAT (Prosperi et al. 2020) and GFED4s (van der Werf et al. 2017). Bookkeeping based CO 2-LULUCF emissions 
(5.7±4.0) are consistent with AR6 WGI and Chapter 2 of this report. The value of 5.9(±4.1) includes CO 2 emissions from urea application to managed soils and pasture. 
Comparisons with other estimates are discussed in 7.2.2. Based on NGHGIs and FAOSTAT, the range is 0 to 0.8 GtCO 2 yr–1.
c CH4 and N 2O emission estimates and assessed uncertainty of 30 and 60% respectively, are based on Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) data 
(Crippa et al. 2021) in accordance with Chapter 2, this report (Sections 2.2.1.3 and 2.2.1.4). Both FAOSTAT (Tubiello 2019; USEPA 2019; FAO 2021a) and the USA EPA (USEPA 
2019) also provide data on agricultural non-CO 2 emissions, however, mean global CH 4 and N 2O values considering the three databases are within the uncertainty bounds of 
EDGAR. EDGAR only considers agricultural and not overall AFOLU non-CO 2 emissions. Agriculture is estimated to account for approximately 89 and 96% of total AFOLU CH 4 
and N 2O emissions respectively. See Section 7.2.3 for further discussion.
d Total non-AFOLU emissions are the sum of total CO 2-eq emissions values for energy, industrial sources, waste and other emissions with data from the Global Carbon Project 
for CO 2, including international aviation and shipping, and from the PRIMAP database for CH 4 and N 2O averaged over 2007–2014, as that was the period for which data 
were available.
e The modelled CO 2 estimates include natural processes in vegetation and soils and how they respond to both natural climate variability and to human-induced environmental 
changes, for example, the response of vegetation and soils to environmental changes such as increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentration, nitrogen deposition, and climate 
change (indirect anthropogenic effects) on both managed and unmanaged lands. The estimate shown represents the average from 17 Dynamic Global Vegetation Models with 
1SD uncertainty (Friedlingstein et al. 2020).
f The NGHGIs take a different approach to calculating ‘anthropogenic’ CO 2 fluxes than the models (Section 7.2.2). In particular the sinks due to environmental change (indirect 
anthropogenic fluxes) on managed lands are generally treated as anthropogenic in NGHGIs and non-anthropogenic in models such as bookkeeping and IAMs. A reconciliation 
of the results between IAMs and NGHGIs is presented in Cross-Chapter Box 6 in this chapter. If applied to this table, it would transfer approximately –5.5 GtCO 2 yr–1 (a sink) 
from Column E (which would become –7.0 GtCO 2 yr–1) to Column A (which would then be 0.4 GtCO 2 yr–1).
g All values expressed in units of CO 2-eq are based on IPCC AR6 100-year Global Warming Potential (GWP100) values with climate-carbon feedbacks (CH 4 = 27, N 2O = 273) 
(Chapter 2, Supplementary Material 2.SM.3; IPCC AR6 WGI Section 7.6).
h For assessment of cross-sector fluxes related to the food sector, see Chapter 12.
i While it is acknowledged that soils are a natural CH 4 sink (Jackson et al. 2020) with soil microbial removals estimated to be 30 ± 19 MtCH 4 yr–1 for the period 2008–2017 
(according to bottom-up estimates), natural CH 4 sources are considerably greater (371 (245–488) MtCH 4 yr–1) resulting in natural processes being a net CH 4 source (IPCC AR6 
WGI Section 5.2.2). The soil CH 4 sink is therefore omitted from Column E.
j Total GHG emissions concerning non-AFOLU sectors and all sectors combined (Columns B and C) include fluorinated gases in addition to CO 2, CH 4 and N 2O. Therefore, total 
values do not equal the sum of estimates for CO 2, CH 4 and N 2O.
(Section 7.2.2.2). While there is low agreement in the trend of global 
AFOLU CO 2 emissions over the past few decades (Section 7.2.2), they 
have remained relatively constant (medium confidence) (Chapter 2). 
Average non-CO 2 emission (aggregated using GWP100 IPCC AR6 
values) from agriculture have risen from 5.2 ± 1.4 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 for 
the period 1990 to 1999, to 6.0 ± 1.7 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 for the period 

To present a fuller understanding of land–atmosphere interactions, 
Table  7.1 includes an estimate of the natural sink of land to 
atmospheric CO 2 (Jia et al. 2019) (IPCC AR6 WGI Chapter 5). Land 
fluxes respond naturally to human-induced environmental change 
(e.g.,  climate change, and the fertilising effects of increased 
atmospheric CO 2 concentration and nitrogen deposition), known as 
‘indirect anthropogenic effects’, and also to ‘natural effects’ such 
as climate variability (IPCC 2010) (Table 7.1 and Section 7.2.2). This 
showed a removal of –12.5 ± 3.2 GtCO 2 yr–1 (medium confidence) 
from the atmosphere during 2010–2019 according to global dynamic 
global vegetation model (DGVM) models (Friedlingstein et al. 2020) 
31% of total anthropogenic net emissions of CO 2 from all sectors. 
It is likely that the NGHIs and FAOSTAT implicitly cover some part 
of this sink and thus provide a net CO 2 AFOLU balance with some 

with the overall net CO 2 value close to being neutral. Model results and atmospheric observations concur that, when combining both 
anthropogenic (AFOLU) and natural processes on the entire land 
surface (the total ‘land–atmosphere flux’), the land was a  global 
net sink for CO 2 of –6.6 ± 4.6 GtCO 2 yr–1 with a range for 2010 to 

Chevallier et al. 2005; Feng et al. 2016; van der Laan-Luijkx et al. 
2017; Niwa et al. 2017; Patra et al. 2018). The natural land sink is 
highly likely to be affected by both future AFOLU activity and climate 
change (IPCC AR6 WGI Box 5.1 and Figure SPM. 7), whereby under 
more severe climate change, the amount of carbon stored on land 
would still increase although the relative share of the emissions that 
land takes up, declines.

Comparison of estimates of the global net AFOLU flux of CO 2 
from diverse approaches (Figure  7.4) show differences on the 
order of several GtCO 2 yr–1. When considering the reasons for the 
differences, and an approach to reconcile them (Grassi et al. 2021) 
(Section 7.2.2.3), there is medium confidence in the magnitude of 
the net AFOLU CO 2 flux. There is a discrepancy in the reported CO 2

linked to deforestation in Latin America, Africa and South-East Asia 
from 1990 to 2019. There is medium confidence in trends indicating 
a  decrease in net emissions in Latin America since 2005 linked to

North America and Eurasia since 2010.
7.2.2.2 Why Do Various Methods Deliver 
Difference in Results?
The processes responsible for fluxes from land have been divided 
into three categories (IPCC 2006, 2010): (i) the direct human-induced 
effects due to changing land cover and land management; (ii) the 
indirect human-induced effects due to anthropogenic environmental 
change, such as climate change, CO 2 fertilisation, nitrogen deposition, 
and so on; and (iii) natural effects, including climate variability and 
a background natural disturbance regime (e.g., wildfires, windthrows, 
diseases or insect outbreaks).
Global models estimate the anthropogenic land CO 2 flux considering 
only the impact of direct effects, and only those areas that were subject 
to intense and direct management such as clear-cut harvest. It is 
important to note, that DGVMs also estimate the non-anthropogenic 
land CO 2 flux (Land Sink) that results from indirect and natural 
effects (Table 7.1). In contrast, estimates of the anthropogenic land 
CO2 flux in NGHGIs (LULUCF) include the impact of direct effects and, 
in most cases, of indirect effects on a much greater area considered 
‘managed’ than global models (Grassi et al. 2021).
The approach used by countries follows the IPCC methodological 
guidance for NGHGIs (IPCC 2006, 2019). Since separating direct, 
indirect and natural effects on the land CO 2 sink is impossible with 
direct observation such as national forest inventories (IPCC 2010), 
upon which most NGHGIs are based, the IPCC adopted the ‘managed 
land’ concept as a  pragmatic proxy to facilitate NGHGI reporting. 
Anthropogenic land GHG fluxes (direct and indirect effects) are 
defined as all those occurring on managed land, that is, where 
human interventions and practices have been applied to perform 
production, ecological or social functions (IPCC 2006, 2019). GHG 
fluxes from unmanaged land are not reported in NGHGIs because 
they are assumed to be non-anthropogenic. Countries report NGHGI 
data with a range of methodologies, resolution and completeness, 
dependent on capacity and available data, consistent with IPCC 
guidelines (IPCC 2006, 2019) and subject to an international review 
or assessment processes.
The FAOSTAT approach is conceptually similar to NGHGIs. FAOSTAT 
data on forests are based on country reports to FAO-FRA 2020 
(FAO 2020a), and include changes in biomass carbon stock in 
‘forest land’ and ‘net forest conversions’ in five-year intervals. 
‘Forest land’ may include unmanaged natural forest, leading to 
possible overall overestimation of anthropogenic fluxes for both 
sources and sinks, though emissions from deforestation are likely 
underestimated (Tubiello et al. 2020). FAOSTAT also estimate 
emissions from forest fires and other land uses (organic soils), 
following IPCC methods (Prosperi et al. 2020). The FAO-FRA 2020 
(FAO 2020b) update leads to estimates of larger sinks in Russia 
since 1991, and in China and the USA from 2011, and larger 
deforestation emissions in Brazil and smaller in Indonesia than 
FRA 2015 (FAO 2015; Tubiello et al. 2020).The bookkeeping models by Houghton and Nassikas (2017), Hansis 
et al. (2015), and Gasser et al. (2020) and the DGVMs used in the 
Global Carbon Budget (Friedlingstein et al. 2020) use either the LUH2 
dataset (Hurtt et al. 2020), HYDE (Goldewijk et al. 2017), FRA 2015 
(FAO 2015) or a combination. The LUH2 dataset includes a new wood 
harvest reconstruction, new representation of shifting cultivation, 
crop rotations, and management information including irrigation and 
fertiliser application. The area of forest subject to harvest in LUH2 
is much less than the area of forest considered ‘managed’ in the 
NGHGIs (Grassi et al. 2018). The model datasets do not yet include 
the FAO FRA 2020 update (FAO 2020a). The DGVMs consider CO 2 
fertilisation effects on forest growth that are sometimes confirmed 
from the ground-based forest inventory networks (Nabuurs et al. 
2013) and sometimes not at all (van der Sleen et al. 2015).
Further, the DGVMs and bookkeeping models do not include a wide 
range of practices which are implicitly covered by the inventories; for 
example: forest dynamics (Pugh et al. 2019; Le Noë et al. 2020), forest 
management including wood harvest (Nabuurs, et al. 2013; Arneth 
et al. 2017), agricultural and grassland practices (Pugh et al. 2015; 
Sanderman et al. 2017; Pongratz et al. 2018); or, for example, fire 
management (Andela et al. 2017; Arora and Melton 2018).
Increasingly, higher emissions estimates are expected from DGVMs 
compared to bookkeeping models, because DGVMs include a  loss 
of additional sink capacity of 3.3 ± 1.1 GtCO 2 yr–1 on average 
over 2009–2018, which is increasing with larger climate and CO 2 
impacts (Friedlingstein et al. 2020). This arises because the DGVM 
methodological setup requires a  reference simulation including 
climate and environmental changes but without any land-use change 
such as deforestation, so DGVMs implicitly include the sink capacity 
forests would have developed in response to environmental changes 
on areas that in reality have been cleared (Gitz and Ciais 2003; 
Pongratz et al. 2014) (IPCC AR6 WGI Chapter 5).
Carbon emissions from peat burning have been estimated based 
on the Global Fire Emission Database (GFED4s; van der Werf et al. 
2017). These were included in the bookkeeping model estimates and 
added 2.0 GtC over 1960–2019 (e.g.,  causing the peak in South-
East Asia in 1998) (Figure  7.5). Within the Global Carbon Budget 
(Friedlingstein et al. 2020), peat drainage from agriculture accounted 
for an additional 8.6 GtC from 1960–2019 according to FAOSTAT 
(Conchedda and Tubiello, 2020) used by two of the bookkeeping 
models (Hansis et al. 2015; Gasser et al. 2020).
Remote-sensing products provide valuable spatial and temporal 
land-use and biomass data globally (including in remote areas), at 
potentially high spatial and temporal resolutions, that can be used to 
calculate CO 2 fluxes, but have mostly been applied only to forests at 
the global or even regional scale. While such data can strongly support 
monitoring reporting and verification, estimates of forest carbon 
fluxes directly from Earth Observation (EO) data vary considerably 
in both their magnitude and sign (i.e., whether forests are a  net 
source or sink of carbon). For the period 2005–2017, net tropical 
forest carbon fluxes were estimated as –0.4 GtCO 2 yr–1 (Fan et al. 
2019); 0.58 GtCO 2 yr–1 (Grace et al. 2014); 1.6 GtCO 2yr–1 (Baccini 
et al. 2017) and 2.87 GtCO 2 yr–1 (Achard et al. 2014). Differences 
definition of ‘forest’ and the inclusion of processes and methods used 
to determine degradation and growth in intact and secondary forests, 
or the changes in algorithm over time (Palahí et al. 2021). A recent 
global study integrated ground observations and remote sensing 
data to map forest-related GHG emissions and removals at a high 
spatial resolution (30 m spatial scale), although it only provides an 
average estimate of annual carbon loss over 2001–2019 (Harris 
et al. 2021). The estimated net global forest carbon sink globally was 
–7.66 GtCO 2 yr−1, being –1.7 GtCO 2yr−1 in the tropics only.
Remote sensing products can help to attribute changes to 
anthropogenic activity or natural inter-annual climate variability 
(Fan et al. 2019; Wigneron et al. 2020). Products with higher spatial 
resolution make it easier to determine forest and carbon dynamics 
in relatively small-sized managed forests (e.g., Y . Wang et al. 2020; Heinrich et al. 2021; Reiche et al. 2021). For example, secondary 
forest regrowth in the Brazilian Amazon offset 9 to 14% of gross 
emissions due to deforestation1 (Aragão et al. 2018; Silva Junior 
et al. 2021). Yet disturbances such as fire and repeated deforestation 
cycles due to shifting cultivation over the period 1985 to 2017, were 
found to reduce the regrowth rates of secondary forests by 8 to 55% 
depending on the climate region of regrowth (Heinrich et al. 2021).

Between Global Models and National Greenhouse 
Gas Inventories (NGHGIs), and Reconciliation

(‘land use’) and NGHGIs (‘LULUCF’), including the attribution of processes responsible for land fluxes (IPCC 2006; 2010) in managed and unmanaged lands. The anthropogenic 
land CO 2 flux by global models typically includes only the CO 2 flux due to ‘direct effects’ (land-use change, harvest, regrowth). By contrast, most NGHGIs consider anthropogenic 
all fluxes occurring in areas defined as ‘managed’, including also the sink due to ‘indirect effects’ (climate change, atmospheric CO 2 increase, N deposition etc.) and due to 
‘natural effects’ (climate variability, background natural disturbances). (b) Proposed solution to the inconsistency, via disaggregation of the ‘Land Sink’ flux from DGVMs into 
CO2 fluxes occurring in managed and in unmanaged lands. The sum of ‘land use’ flux (direct effects from bookkeeping models or IAMs) and the ‘Land Sink’ (indirect effects from 
DGVMs) in managed lands produces an adjusted global model CO 2 flux which is conceptually more comparable with LULUCF fluxes from NGHGIs. Note that the figure may in 
some cases be an oversimplification, in other words, not all NGHGIs include all recent indirect effects.
making estimates comparable, can build confidence in land-related 
CO2 estimates, for example for the purpose of assessing collective 
progress in the context of the Global Stocktake (Cross-Chapter Box 6 
in this chapter). The difference largely results from greater estimated 
CO2 in NGHGIs, mostly occurring in forests (Grassi et al. 2021). 
This difference is potentially a consequence of: (i) simplified and/or 
incomplete representation of management in global models (Popp 
et al. 2017; Pongratz et al. 2018), for example, concerning impacts of 
forest management in biomass expansion and thickening (Nabuurs 
et al. 2013; Grassi et al. 2017), (ii) inaccurate and/or incomplete 
estimation of LULUCF fluxes in NGHGIs (Grassi et al. 2017), especially 
in developing countries, primarily in non-forest land uses and in soils, 
and (iii) conceptual differences in how global models and NGHGIs 
define ‘anthropogenic’ CO 2 flux from land (Grassi et al. 2018). The 
impacts of (i) and (ii) are difficult to quantify and result in uncertainties 
that will decrease slowly over time through improvements of both 
models and NGHGIs. By contrast, the inconsistencies in (iii) and its 
resulting biases were assessed as explained below.Since changing the NGHGIs’ approach is impractical, an interim 
method to translate and adjust the output of global models was 
outlined for reconciling a bookkeeping model and NGHGIs (Grassi 
et al. 2018). More recently, an improved version of this approach 
has been applied to the future mitigation pathways estimated 
by IAMs (Grassi et al. 2021), with the implications for the Global 
Stocktake discussed in Cross-Chapter Box  6 in this chapter. This 
method implies a post-processing of current global models’ results 
that addresses two components of the conceptual differences in 
the ‘anthropogenic’ CO 2 flux; (i) how the impact of human-induced 
environmental changes (indirect effects) are considered, and (ii) the 
extent of forest area considered ‘managed’. Essentially, this approach 
adds DGVM estimates of CO 2 fluxes due to indirect effects from 
countries’ managed forest area (using non-intact forest area maps 
as a proxy) to the original global models’ anthropogenic land CO 2 
fluxes (Figure 7.6).

Collective Climate Progress in the Global Stocktake

The Global Stocktake aims to assess countries’ collective progress towards the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement in the light 
of the best available science. Historic progress is assessed based on NGHGIs, while expectations of future progress are based on 
country climate targets (e.g., NDCs for 2025 or 2030 and long-term strategies for 2050). Scenarios consistent with limiting warming 
well-below 2°C and 1.5°C developed by IAMs (Chapter 3) are expected to play a key role as benchmarks against which countries’ 
aggregated future mitigation pledges will be assessed. This, however, implies that estimates by IAMs and country data used to 
measure progress are comparable.
In fact, there is about 5.5 GtCO 2 yr–1 difference during 2005–2015 between global anthropogenic land CO 2 net flux estimates of IAMs 
and aggregated NGHGIs, due to different conceptual approaches to what is ‘anthropogenic’. This approach and its implications when 
comparing climate targets with global mitigation pathways are illustrated in this Box Figure 1a–e.
By adjusting the original IAM output (Cross-Chapter Box  6, Figure  1a) with the indirect effects from countries’ managed forest 
(Cross-Chapter Box 6, Figure 1b, estimated by DGVMs, see also Figure 7.6), NGHGI-comparable pathways can be derived (Cross-
Chapter Box 6, Figure 1c). The resulting apparent increase in anthropogenic sink reflects simply a reallocation of a CO 2 flux previously 
labelled as natural, and thus does not reflect a  mitigation action. These changes do not affect non-LULUCF emissions. However, 
since the atmosphere concentration is a combination of CO 2 emissions from LULUCF and from fossil fuels, the proposed land-related 
adjustments also influence the NGHGI-comparable economy-wide (all sector) CO 2 pathways (Cross-Chapter Box 6, Figure 1d).
This approach does not imply a change in the original decarbonisation pathways, nor does it suggest that indirect effects should be 
considered in the mitigation efforts. It simply ensures that a like-with-like comparison is made: if countries’ climate targets use the 
NGHGI definition of anthropogenic emissions, this same definition can be applied to derive NGHGI-comparable future CO 2 pathways. 
This would have an impact on the NGHGI-comparable remaining carbon  or GHG budget (i.e., the allowable emissions until net zero 
CO2 or GHG emissions consistent with a certain climate target). For example, for SSP2-1.9 and SSP2-2.6 (representing pathways in 
line with 1.5°C and well-below 2°C limits under SSP2 assumptions), carbon budget is 170 GtCO 2-eq lower than the original remaining 
carbon budget according to the models’ approach (Cross-Chapter Box 6, Figure 1e). Similarly, the remaining carbon (or GHG) budgets 
in Chapter 3 (this report), as well as the net zero carbon (or GHG) targets, could only be used in combination with the definition of 
anthropogenic emissions as used by the IAMs (Cross-Chapter Box 3 in Chapter 3). In the absence of these adjustments, collective 
progress would appear better than it is.
The UNEP’s annual assessment of the global 2030 ‘emission gap’ between aggregated country NDCs and specific target mitigation 
pathways (UNEP 2020), is only affected to a limited degree. This is because some estimates of global emissions under the NDCs 
already use the same land-use definitions as the IAM mitigation pathways (Rogelj et al. 2017), and because historical data of global 
NDC estimates is typically harmonised to the historical data of global mitigation pathway projections (Rogelj et al. 2011). This latter 
procedure, however, is agnostic to the reasons for the observed mismatch, and often uses a constant offset. The adjustment described 
here allows this mismatch to be resolved by drawing on a scientific understanding of the underlying reasons, and thus provides a more 
informed and accurate basis for estimating the emission gap.
The approach to deriving a NGHGI-comparable emission pathways presented here can be further refined with improved estimates of 
the future forest sink. Its use would enable a more accurate assessment of the collective progress achieved and of mitigation pledges 
under the Paris Agreement.

(dashed line), for example, by adding the indirect effects in panel b. The indirect effects in panel b decline over time with increasing mitigation ambition, mainly 
because of the weaker CO 2 fertilisation effect. In panel c, the dependency of the adjusted LULUCF pathways on the target becomes less evident after 2030, because 
the indirect effects in countries’ managed forest (which are progressively more uncertain with time, as highlighted by the grey areas) compensate the effects of the 
original pathways. (d) NGHGI-comparable pathways for global CO 2 emissions from all sectors including LULUCF (obtained by combining global CO 2 pathways without

Trends in atmospheric CH 4 and N 2O concentrations and the 
associated sources, including land and land use are discussed in 
Sections 5.2.2 and 5.2.3 of the IPCC AR6 WGI. Regarding AFOLU, the 
SRCCL and AR5 (Jia et al. 2019; Smith et al. 2014) identified three 
global non-CO 2 emissions data sources: EDGAR (Crippa et al. 2021), 
FAOSTAT (FAO 2021a; Tubiello, 2019) and the USA EPA (USEPA 2019). 
Methodological differences have been previously discussed (Jia et al. 
2019). In accordance with Chapter 2, this report, EDGAR data are 
used in Table 7.1 and Figure 7.3. It is important to note that in terms of 
AFOLU sectoral CH 4 and N 2O emissions, only FAOSTAT provides data 
on AFOLU emissions, while EDGAR and USEPA data consider just the 
agricultural component. However, the mean of values across the three 
databases for both CH 4 and N 2O, fall within the assessed uncertainty 
bounds (30 and 60% for CH 4 and N 2O respectively, Section  2.2.1, 
in this report) of EDGAR data. NGHGIs annually submitted to the 
UNFCCC (Section 7.2.2.3) provide national AFOLU CH 4 and N 2O data, 
as included in the SRCCL (Jia et al. 2019). Aggregation of NGHGIs to 
indicate global emissions must be considered with caution, as not all countries compile inventories, nor submit annually. Additionally, 
NGHGIs may incorporate a  range of methodologies for CH 4 and 
N2O accounting (e.g., van der Weerden et al. 2016; Ndung’u et al. 
2019; Thakuri et al. 2020), making comparison difficult. The analysis 
of complete AFOLU emissions presented here, is based on FAOSTAT 
data. For agricultural specific discussion, analysis considers EDGAR, 
FAOSTAT and USEPA data.
7.2.3.1 Global AFOLU CH 4 and N 2O Emissions
Using FAOSTAT data, the SRCCL estimated average CH 4 emissions 
from AFOLU to be 161.2 ± 43 MtCH 4 yr–1 for the period 2007–2016, 
representing 44% of total anthropogenic CH 4 emissions, with 
agriculture accounting for 88% of the AFOLU component (Jia 
et al. 2019). The latest data (FAO 2021a, 2020b) highlight a trend of 
growing AFOLU CH 4 emissions, with a 10% increase evident between 

use (FOLU) CH 4 emission sources include biomass burning on forest 
land and combustion of organic soils (peatland fires) (FAO 2020c).

versions of databases indicate historic emissions to 2019, 2019 and 2015 respectively, with average values for the post–2010 period calculated accordingly. For CH 4, emissions 
classified as ‘Other Ag.’ within USEPA data, are re-classified as ‘Agricultural Biomass Burning’. Despite CH 4 emissions from agricultural soils also being included, this category 
was deemed to principally concern biomass burning on agricultural land and classified accordingly. For N 2O, emissions classified within EDGAR as direct and indirect emissions 
from managed soils, and indirect emissions from manure management are combined under ‘Agricultural Soils’. Emissions classified by FOASTAT as from manure deposition and 
application to soils, crop residues, drainage of organic soils and synthetic fertilisers are combined under ‘Agricultural Soils’, while emissions reported as ‘Other Ag.’ under USEPA 
data are re-classified as ‘Agricultural Biomass Burning’.
accounted for 89% of emissions on average between 1990 and 2019. 
The SRCCL reported with medium evidence and high agreement that 
ruminants and rice production were the most important contributors 
to overall growth trends in atmospheric CH 4 (Jia et al. 2019). The latest 
data confirm this in terms of agricultural emissions, with agreement 
between databases that agricultural CH 4 emissions continue to 
increase and that enteric fermentation and rice cultivation remain 
the main sources (Figure  7.7). The proportionally higher emissions 
from rice cultivation indicated by EDGAR data compared to the other 
databases, may result from the use of a Tier 2 methodology for this 
source within EDGAR (Janssens-Maenhout et al. 2019).
The SRCCL also noted a  trend of increasing atmospheric N 2O 
concentration, with robust evidence and high agreement that 
agriculture accounted for approximately two-thirds of overall global 
anthropogenic N 2O emissions. Average AFOLU N 2O emissions were 
reported to be 8.7 ± 2.5 MtN 2O yr–1 for the period 2007–2016, 
accounting for 81% of total anthropogenic N 2O emissions, with 
agriculture accounting for 95% of AFOLU N 2O emissions (Jia et al. 
2019). A  recent comprehensive review confirms agriculture as the 
principal driver of the growing atmospheric N 2O concentration (Tian 
et al. 2020). The latest FAOSTAT data (FAO 2020b, 2021a) document 
a 25% increase in AFOLU N 2O emissions between 1990 and 2019, with the average share from agriculture remaining approximately 
the same (96%). Agricultural soils were identified in the SRCCL and 
in recent literature as a dominant emission source, notably due to 
nitrogen fertiliser and manure applications to croplands, and manure 
production and deposition on pastures (Jia et al. 2019; Tian et al. 
2020). There is agreement within latest data that agricultural soils 
remain the dominant source (Figure 7.7).
Aggregation of CH 4 and N 2O to CO 2 equivalence (using GWP100 IPCC 
AR6 values), suggests that AFOLU emissions increased by 15% between 

Agriculture accounted for 91% of AFOLU emissions on average over 
the period (FAO 2020b, 2021a). EDGAR (Crippa et al. 2021), FAOSTAT 
(FAO 2021a) and USEPA (USEPA 2019) data suggest aggregated 
agricultural emissions (CO 2-eq) to have increased since 1990, by 19% 
(1990–2019), 15% (1990–2019) and 21% (1990–2015) respectively, 
with all databases identifying enteric fermentation and agricultural 
soils as the dominant agricultural emissions sources.
7.2.3.2 Regional AFOLU CH 4 and N 2O Emissions
FAOSTAT data (FAO 2020b, 2021a) indicate Africa (+44%), followed 
by Southern Asia (+29%) to have the largest growth in AFOLU 
CH4 emissions between 1990 and 2019 (Figure  7.8). Eurasia was

as a result of a sharp decline (–63%) between 1990 and 1999. The 
average agricultural share of AFOLU emissions between 1990 and 

In agreement with AR5 (Smith et al. 2014), the SRCCL identified 
Asia as having the largest share (37%) of emissions from enteric 
fermentation and manure management since 2000, but Africa to have 
the fastest growth rate. Asia was identified as responsible for 89% of 
rice cultivation emissions, which were reported as increasing (Jia et al. 
2019). Considering classification by ten IPCC regions, data suggest 
enteric fermentation to have dominated emissions in all regions since 
1990, except in South-East Asia and Pacific, where rice cultivation 
forms the principal source (FAO 2021; USEPA 2019). The different 
databases broadly indicate the same regional CH 4 emission trends, 
though the indicated absolute change differs due to methodological 
differences (Section  7.2.3.1). All databases indicate considerable 
emissions growth in Africa since 1990 and that this region recorded 
the greatest regional increases in emissions from both enteric 
fermentation and rice cultivation since 2010. Additionally, FAOSTAT 
data suggest that emissions from agricultural biomass burning 
account for a notably high proportion of agricultural CH 4 emissions 
in Africa (Figure 7.8).
The latest data suggest growth in AFOLU N 2O emissions in most 
regions between 1990 and 2019, with Southern Asia demonstrating 
highest growth (+74%) and Eurasia, greatest reductions (–51%), 
the latter mainly a  result of a  61% reduction between 1990 and 

source in all regions, its proportional average share between 1990 
and 2019 ranging from 87% in Africa, to almost 100% in the Middle 
East (Figure 7.8).
The SRCCL provided limited discussion on regional variation in 
agricultural N 2O emissions but reported with medium confidence 
that certain regions (North America, Europe, East and South Asia) 
were notable sources of grazing land N 2O emissions (Jia et al. 
2019). The AR5 identified Asia as the largest source and as having 
the highest growth rate of N 2O emissions from synthetic fertilisers 
between 2000 and 2010 (Smith et al. 2014). Latest data indicate 
agricultural N 2O emission increases in most regions, though 
variation between databases prevents definitive conclusions on 
trends, with Africa, Southern Asia, and Eastern Asia suggested to 
have had greatest growth since 1990 according to EDGAR (Crippa 
et al. 2021), FAOSTAT (FAO 2021a) and USEPA (USEPA 2019) data 
respectively. However, all databases indicate that emissions declined 
in Eurasia and Europe from 1990 levels, in accordance with specific 
environmental regulations put in place since the late 1980s (Tubiello 
2019; European Environment Agency 2020; Tian et al. 2020), but 
generally suggest increases in both regions since 2010.
7.2.4 Biophysical Effects and Short-lived 
Climate Forcers
Despite new literature, general conclusions from the SRCCL 
and WGI-AR6 on biophysical effects and short-lived climate forcers remain the same. Changes in land conditions from land 
cover  change  or  land  management jointly affect water, energy, 
and aerosol fluxes (biophysical fluxes) as well as GHG fluxes 
(biogeochemical fluxes) exchanged between the land and atmosphere 
(high agreement, robust evidence) (Anderson et al. 2011; O’Halloran 
et al. 2012; Alkama and Cescatti 2016; Naudts et al. 2016; Erb et al. 
2017). There is high confidence that changes in land condition do 
not just have local impacts but also have non-local impacts in 
adjacent and more distant areas (Pielke et al. 2011; Mahmood et al. 
2014) which may contribute to surpassing climate tipping points 
(Nepstad et al. 2008; Brando et al. 2014). Non-local impacts may 
occur through: GHG fluxes and subsequent changes in radiative 
transfer, changes in atmospheric chemistry, thermal, moisture and 
surface pressure gradients creating horizontal transport (advection) 
(de  Vrese et al. 2016; Davin and de Noblet-Ducoudré 2010) and 
vertical transport (convection and subsidence) (Devaraju et al. 2018). 
Although regional and global biophysical impacts emerge from 
model simulations (Davin and de Noblet-Ducoudré 2010; de Vrese 
et al. 2016; Devaraju et al. 2018), especially if the land condition 
has changed over large areas, there is very low agreement on the 
location, extent and characteristics of the non-local effects across 
models. Recent methodological advances, empirically confirmed 
changes in temperature and precipitation owing to distant changes 
in forest cover (Cohn et al. 2019; Meier et al. 2021).
Following changes in land conditions, CO 2, CH 4 and N 2O fluxes are 
quickly mixed into the atmosphere and dispersed, resulting in the 
biogeochemical effects being dominated by the biophysical effects at 
local scales (high confidence) (Y . Li et al. 2015; Alkama and Cescatti 
2016). Afforestation/reforestation (Lejeune et al. 2018; Strandberg 
and Kjellström 2019), urbanisation (Li and Bou-Zeid 2013) and 
irrigation (Mueller et al. 2016 and Thiery et al. 2017) modulate the 
likelihood, intensity, and duration of many extreme events including 
heatwaves (high confidence) and heavy precipitation events (medium 
confidence) (Haberlie et al. 2015). There is high confidence and high 
agreement that afforestation in the tropics (Perugini et al. 2017), 
irrigation (Alter et al. 2015; Mueller et al. 2016) and urban greening 
result in local cooling, high agreement and medium confidence on 
the impact of tree growth form (deciduous vs evergreen) (Naudts 
et al. 2016; Luyssaert et al. 2018 and Schwaab et al. 2020), and 
low agreement on the impact of wood harvest, fertilisation, tillage, 
crop harvest, residue management, grazing, mowing, and fire 
management on the local climate.
Studies of biophysical effects have increased since AR5 reaching high 
agreement for the effects of changes in land condition on surface 
albedo (Leonardi et al. 2015). Low confidence remains in proposing 
specific changes in land conditions to achieve desired impacts on 
local, regional and global climates due to: a poor relationship between 
changes in surface albedo and changes in surface temperature (Davin 
and de Noblet-Ducoudré 2010), compensation and feedbacks among 
biophysical processes (Bonan 2016; Kalliokoski et al. 2020), climate 
and seasonal dependency of the biophysical effects (Bonan 2016), 
omittance of short-lived chemical forcers (Unger 2014; Kalliokoski 
et al. 2020), and study domains often being too small to document 
possible conflicts between local and non-local effects (Swann et al. 
2012; Hirsch et al. 2018).
Since AR5 several global assessments (IPBES 2018a; NYDF Assessment 
Partners 2019; UNEP 2019; IPCC 2019) and studies (e.g., Tubiello 2019; 
Tian et al. 2020) have reported on drivers (natural and anthropogenic 
factors that affect emissions and sinks of the land-use sector) behind 
AFOLU emissions trends, and associated projections for the coming 
decades. The following analysis aligns with the drivers typology used 
by IPBES (2019b) and the Global Environmental Outlook (UNEP 2019). 
Drivers are divided into direct drivers resulting from human decisions 
and actions concerning land use and land-use change, and indirect 
drivers that operate by altering the level or rate of change of one or 
more direct drivers. Although drivers of emissions in agriculture and 
FOLU are presented separately, they are interlinked, operating in many 
complex ways at different temporal and spatial scales, with outcomes 
depending on their interactions. For example, deforestation in tropical 
forests is a  significant component of sectorial emissions. A  review 
of deforestation drivers’ studies published between 1996 and 2013, 
indicated a wide range of factors associated with deforestation rates 
across many analyses and studies, covering different regions (Busch 
and Ferretti-Gallon 2017) (Figure 7.9). Higher agricultural prices were 
identified as a  key driver of deforestation, while law enforcement, 
area protection, and ecosystem services payments were found to be 
important drivers of reduced deforestation, while timber activity did 
not show a consistent impact.7.3.1 Anthropogenic Direct Drivers: Deforestation, 
Conversion of Other Ecosystems, and 
Land Degradation
The global forest area in 2020 is estimated at 4.1 billion ha, 
representing 31% of the total land area (FAO 2020a). Most forests 
are situated in the tropics (45%), followed by boreal (27%), 
temperate (16%) and subtropical (11%) domains. Considering 
regional distribution of global forest area, Europe and the Russian 
Federation accounts for 25%, followed by South America (21%), 
North and Central America (19%), Africa (16%), Asia (15%) and 
Oceania (5%). However, a significant share (54%) of the world’s 
forest area concerns five countries – The Russian Federation, Brazil, 
Canada, the USA and China (FAO 2020a). Forest loss rates differ 
among regions though the global trend is towards a net forest loss 
(UNEP 2019). The global forest area declined by about 178 Mha in 
the 30 years from 1990 to 2020 (FAO 2020a). The rate of net forest 
loss has decreased since 1990, a  result of reduced deforestation 
in some countries and forest gains in others. The annual net loss 
of forest area declined from 7.8 Mha in 1990–2000, to 5.2 Mha 
in 2000–2010, to 4.7 Mha in 2010–2020, while the total growing 
stock in global forests increased (FAO 2020a). The rate of decline 
in net forest loss during the last decade was due mainly to an 
increase in the rate of forest gain (i.e., afforestation and the natural 
expansion of forests).

For example, a ratio of –4x indicates that a variable is associated with less deforestation four times as often as it is associated with 
more deforestation.

significant importance, with almost 1 billion hectares (FAO 2020a). 
The area of other wooded land decreased by 30.6 Mha between 

2020a). There are still significant challenges in monitoring the 
area of other wooded land, largely associated with difficulties in 
measuring tree-canopy cover in the range of 5–10%.The global area 
of mangroves, one of the most productive terrestrial ecosystems 
(Neogi 2020a), has also experienced a significant decline (Thomas 
et al. 2017; Neogi 2020b), with a decrease of 1.0 Mha between 1990 
and 2020 (FAO 2020a) due to agriculture and aquaculture (Bhattarai 
2011; Ajonina et al. 2014; Webb et al. 2014; Giri et al. 2015; Thomas 
et al. 2017; Fauzi et al. 2019). Some relevant direct drivers affecting 
emissions and removal in forests and other ecosystems are discussed 
in proceeding sections.
7.3.1.1 Conversion of Natural Ecosystems to Agriculture
Previous IPCC reports identify land-use change as an important 
driver of emissions and agriculture as a key driver of land-use change, 
causing both deforestation and wetland drainage (P .  Smith et al. 
2019a). The AR5 reported a  trend of declining global agricultural 
land area since 2000 (Smith et al. 2014). The latest data (FAO 2021b) 
indicate a 2% reduction in the global agricultural area between 2000 
and 2019 (Figure 7.10). This area includes (though is not limited to) 
land under permanent and temporary crops or pasture, temporary 
fallow and natural meadows and pasture utilised for grazing or 
agricultural purposes (FAO 2021b), although the extent of land 
used for grazing may not be fully captured (Fetzel et al. 2017). Data 
indicate changes in how agricultural land is used. Between 2000 
and 2019, the area classified as permanent meadow and pasture 
decreased (–6%) while cropland area (under arable production 
and temporary crops) increased (+2%). A key driver of this change 
has been a  general trend of intensification, including in livestock 
production (Barger et al. 2018; OECD/FAO 2019; UNEP 2019), 
whereby less grazing land is supporting increasing livestock numbers 
in conjunction with greater use of crops as livestock feed (Barger 
et al. 2018). The share of feed crops, such as maize and soybean, of 
global crop production is projected to grow as the demand for animal 
feed increases with further intensification of livestock production 
(OECD/FAO 2019). Despite increased demand for food, feed, fuel 
and fibre from a  growing human population (FAO 2019b), global 
agricultural land area is projected to remain relatively stable during 
the next decade, with increases in production expected to result from 
agricultural intensification (OECD/FAO 2019).
Despite a decline in global agricultural area, the latest data document 
some regional expansion between 2000 and 2019, specifically in 
Africa (+3%) and Asia and the Pacific (+1%). Agricultural area 
declined in all other regions, notably in developed countries (–9%), 
due to multiple factors including among others, urbanisation (see 
Section 7.3.1.2).7.3.1.2 Infrastructure Development and Urbanisation
Although built-up areas (defined as cities, towns, villages and human 
infrastructure) occupy a  relatively small fraction of land (around 
1% of global land), since 1975 urban clusters (i.e., urban centres as 
well as surrounding suburbs) have expanded approximately 2.5 times 
(UNEP 2019; Chapter 8, this report). Regional differences are striking. 
Between 1975 and 2015, built-up areas doubled in size in Europe 
while urban population remained relatively constant. In Africa built-
up areas grew approximately fourfold, while urban population 
tripled (UNEP 2019). Trends indicate that rural-to-urban migration 
will continue and accelerate in developing countries increasing 
environmental pressure in spite of measures to mitigate some of 
the impacts (e.g., by preserving or enhancing natural systems within 
cities, for example, lakes or natural and urban green infrastructures 
(UNEP 2019). If current population densities within cities remain 
stable, the extent of built-up areas in developed countries is expected 
to increase by 30% and triple in developing countries between 2000 
and 2050 (Barger et al. 2018).
Urban expansion leads to landscape fragmentation and urban sprawl 
with effects on forest resources and land use (Ünal et al. 2019) while 
interacting with other drives. For example, in the Brazilian Amazon, 
the most rapid urban growth occurs within cities that are located 
near rural areas that produce commodities (minerals or crops) and 
are connected to export corridors (Richards and VanWey 2015). 
Urbanisation, coastal development and industrialisation also play 
crucial roles in the significant loss of mangrove forests (Hirales-Cota 
2010; Richards and Friess 2016; Rivera-Monroy et al. 2017). Among 
infrastructural developments, roads are one of the most consistent 
and most considerable factors in deforestation, particularly in tropical 
frontiers (Pfaff et al. 2007; Rudel et al. 2009; Ferretti-Gallon and 
Busch 2014). The development of roads may also bring subsequent 
impacts on further development intensity due to increasing economic 
activities (see Chapter 8) mostly in the tropics and subtropics, where 
the expansion of road networks increases access to remote forests 
that act as refuges for biodiversity (Campbell et al. 2017) (Box 7.1). 
Logging is one of the main drivers of road construction in tropical 
forests (Kleinschroth and Healey 2017) which leads to more severe 
long-term impacts that include increased fire incidence, soil erosion, 
landslides, and sediment accumulation in streams, biological 
invasions, wildlife poaching, illicit land colonisation, illegal logging 
and mining, land grabbing and land speculation (Laurance et al. 
2009; Alamgir et al. 2017).
Summary
Rapidly expanding roads, particularly in tropical regions, are linked to forest loss, degradation, and fragmentation because the land 
becomes more generally accessible. Increase of land values of areas adjacent to roads also drives speculation and deforestation 
related to land tenure (Fearnside 2015). If poorly planned, infrastructure can facilitate fires, illegal mining, and wildlife poaching with 
consequences for GHG emissions and biodiversity conservation. However, some initiatives are providing new approaches for better 
planning and then limit environmental and societal impacts.
Background
Although the number and extent of protected areas has increased markedly in recent decades (Watson et al. 2014), many other 
indicators reveal that nature is in broad retreat. For example, the total area of intact wilderness is declining rapidly worldwide (Watson 
et al. 2016), 70% of the world’s forests are now less than 1 km from a forest edge (Haddad et al. 2015), the extent of tropical forest 
fragmentation is accelerating exponentially (Taubert et al. 2018). One of the most direct and immediate driver of deforestation and 
biodiversity decline is the dramatic expansion of roads and other transportation infrastructure (Laurance et al. 2014a; Laurance 
and Arrea 2017; Alamgir et al. 2017).
Case description
From 2010 to 2050, the total length of paved roads is projected to increase by 25 million km (Dulac 2013) including large infrastructure-
expansion schemes in Asia (Laurance and Arrea 2017; Lechner et al. 2018) and in South America (Laurance et al. 2001; Killeen 2007), 
as well as widespread illegal or unplanned road building (Laurance et al. 2009; Barber et al. 2014). For example, in the Amazon, 
95% of all deforestation occurs within 5.5 km of a road, and for every km of legal road there are nearly three km of illegal roads 
(Barber et al. 2014).
Interactions and limitations
More than any other proximate factor, the dramatic expansion of roads is determining the pace and patterns of habitat disruption and 
its impacts on biodiversity (Laurance et al. 2009; Laurance and Arrea 2017). Much road expansion is poorly planned. Environmental 
Impact Assessments (EIAs) for roads and other infrastructure are typically too short term and superficial to detect rare species or 
assess long-term or indirect impacts of projects (Flyvbjerg 2009; Laurance and Arrea 2017). Another limitation is the consideration 
of each project in isolation from other existing or planned developments (Laurance et al. 2014b). Hence, EIAs alone are inadequate 
for planning infrastructure projects and assessing their broader environmental, social, and financial impacts and risks (Laurance et al. 
2015a; Alamgir et al. 2017, 2018).
Lessons
The large-scale, proactive land-use planning is an option for managing the development of modern infrastructure. Approaches such 
as the ‘Global Roadmap’ scheme (Laurance and Balmford 2013; Laurance et al. 2014a) Strategic Environmental Assessments (Fischer 
2007) can be used to evaluate the relative costs and benefits of infrastructure projects, and to spatially prioritise land uses to optimise 
human benefits while limited new infrastructure in areas of intact or critical habitats. For example, the Global Roadmap strategy has 
been used in parts of South-East Asia (Sloan et al. 2018), Indochina (Balmford et al. 2016), and sub-Saharan Africa (Laurance et al. 
2015b) to devise land-use zoning that can help optimise the many risks and rewards of planned infrastructure projects.
7.3.1.3 Extractive Industry Development
The extent and scale of mining is growing due to increased global 
demand (UNEP 2019). Due to declining ore grades, more ore needs 
to be processed to meet demand, with extensive use of open cast 
mining. A  low-carbon future may be more mineral intensive with, 
for example, clean energy technologies requiring greater inputs in 
comparison to fossil-fuel-based technologies (Hund et al. 2020). 
Mining presents cumulative environmental impacts, especially in 
intensively mined regions (UNEP 2019). The impact of mining on 
deforestation varies considerably across minerals and countries. 
Mining causes significant changes to the environment, for example, 
through mining infrastructure establishment, soil erosion, urban expansion to support a  growing workforce and development of 
mineral commodity supply chains (Sonter et al. 2015). The increasing 
consumption of gold in developing countries, increased prices, and 
uncertainty in financial markets is identified as driving gold mining 
and associated deforestation in the Amazon region (Alvarez-Berrios 
and Mitchell Aide 2015; Dezécache et al. 2017; Asner and Tupayachi 
2017; Espejo et al. 2018). The total estimated area of gold mining 
throughout the region increased by about 40% between 2012 and 

significantly increased forest loss up to 70 km beyond mining lease 
boundaries, causing 11,670 km2 of deforestation between 2005 and 
2015, representing 9% of all Amazon forest loss during this time 
(Sonter et al. 2015).
countries. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the second-
largest area of tropical forest in the world occurs, mining-related 
deforestation exacerbated by violent conflict (Butsic et al. 2015). 
In India, mining has contributed to deforestation at a district level, 
with coal, iron and limestone having had the most adverse impact 
on forest area loss (Ranjan 2019). Gold mining is also identified as 
a driver of deforestation in Myanmar (Papworth et al. 2017).
7.3.1.4 Fire Regime Changes
Wildland fires account for approximately 70% of the global biomass 
burned annually (van der Werf et al. 2017) and constitute a  large 
global source of atmospheric trace gases and aerosols (Gunsch et al. 
2018) (IPCC WGI AR6). Although fires are part of the natural system, 
the frequency of fires has increased in many areas, exacerbated by 
decreases in precipitation, including in many regions with humid and 
temperate forests that rarely experience large-scale fires naturally. 
Natural and human-ignited fires affect all major biomes, from 
peatlands through shrublands to tropical and boreal forests, altering 
ecosystem structure and functioning (Argañaraz et al. 2015; Nunes 
et al. 2016; Remy et al. 2017; Mancini et al. 2018; Aragão et al. 2018; 
Engel et al. 2019; Rodríguez Vásquez et al. 2021). However, the degree 
of incidence and regional trends are quite different and a study over 

North America and Northern Hemisphere Africa (Andela et al. 2019). 
More than half of the terrestrial surface of the Earth has fire regimes 
outside the range of natural variability, with changes in fire frequency 
and intensity posing major challenges for land restoration and 
recovery (Barger et al. 2018). In some ecosystems, fire prevention 
might lead to accumulation of large fuel loads that enable wildfires 
(Moreira et al. 2020a).
About 98 Mha of forest and savannahs are estimated to have been 
affected by fire in 2015 (FAO and UNEP 2020). Fire is a prevalent 
forest disturbance in the tropics where about 4% of the total forest 
and savannah area in that year was burned and more than two-
thirds of the total area affected was in Africa and South America; 
mostly open savanna types (FAO and UNEP 2020). Fires have many 
different causes, with land clearing for agriculture the primary driver 
in tropical regions, for example, clearance for industrial oil-palm and 
paper-pulp plantations in Indonesia (Chisholm et al. 2016), or for 
pastures in the Amazon (Barlow et al. 2020). Other socio-economic 
factors are also associated with wildfire regimes such as land-use 
conflict and socio-demographic aspects (Nunes et al. 2016; Mancini 
et al. 2018). Wildfire regimes are also changing by the influence 
of climate change, with wildfire seasons becoming longer, wildfire 
average size increases in many areas and wildfires occurring in areas 
where they did not occur before (Jolly et al. 2015; Artés et al. 2019). 
Human influence has likely increased fire weather in some regions of 
all inhabited continents (IPCC AR6 WGI Technical Summary) and, in  
the last years, fire seasons of unprecedented magnitude occurred 
in diverse regions as California (Goss et al. 2020), the Mediterranean 
basin (Ruffault et al. 2020), Canada (Kirchmeier -Young et al. 2019) 
with unprecedented fires in British Columbia in 2021, the Arctic and 
Siberia (McCarty et al. 2020), Brazilian Amazon (Silva et al. 2021) 
and Pantanal (Leal Filho et al. 2021), Chile (Bowman et al. 2019) and Australia (Ward et al. 2020; Gallagher et al. 2021). Lightning plays 
an important role in the ignition of wildfires, with the incidence of 
lightning igniting wildfires predicted to increase with rises in global 
average air temperature (Worden et al. 2017).
7.3.1.5 Logging and Fuelwood Harvest
The area of forest designated for production has been relatively 
stable since 1990. Considering forest uses, about 30% (1.2 billion ha) 
of all forests is used primarily for production (wood and non-wood 
forest products), about 10% (424 Mha) is designated for biodiversity 
conservation, 398 Mha for the protection of soil and water, and 

research and the conservation of cultural and spiritual sites) (FAO and 
UNEP 2020). While the rate of increase in the area of forest allocated 
primarily for biodiversity conservation has slowed in the last ten years, 
the rate of increase in the area of forest allocated for soil and water 
protection has grown since 1990, and notably in the last ten years. 
Global wood harvest (including from forests, other wooded land and 
trees outside forests) was estimated to be almost 4.0 billion m3 in 

2019). Overall, wood removals are increasing globally as demand for, 
and the consumption of wood products grows annually by 1% in line 
with growing populations and incomes with this trend expected to 
continue in coming decades. When done in a sustainable way, more 
regrowth will occur and is stimulated by management, resulting in 
a net sink. However illegal and unsustainable logging (i.e., harvesting 
of timber in contravention of the laws and regulations of the country 
of harvest) is a global problem with significant negative economic 
(e.g.,  lost revenue), environmental (e.g.,  deforestation, forest 
degradation, GHG emissions and biodiversity losses) and social 
impact (e.g.,  conflicts over land and resources, disempowerment 
of local and indigenous communities) (World Bank 2019). Many 
countries around the world have introduced regulations for the 
international trade of forest products to reduce illegal logging, with 
significant and positive impacts (Guan et al. 2018).
Over-extraction of wood for timber and fuelwood is identified as 
an important driver of mangrove deforestation and degradation 
(Bhattarai 2011; Ajonina et al. 2014; Webb et al. 2014; Giri et al. 2015; 
Thomas et al. 2017; Fauzi et al. 2019). Unsustainable selective logging 
and over-extraction of wood is a  substantial form of forest and 
mangrove degradation in many tropical and developing countries, 
with emissions associated with the extracted wood, incidental 
damage to the surrounding forest and from logging infrastructure 
(Bhattarai 2011; Ajonina et al. 2014; Webb et al. 2014; Pearson 
et al. 2014, Giri et al. 2015; Thomas et al. 2017; Fauzi et al. 2019). 
Traditional fuelwood and charcoal continue to represent a dominant 
share of total wood consumption in low-income countries (Barger 
et al. 2018). Regionally, the percentage of total wood harvested used 
as fuelwood varies from 90% in Africa, 62% in Asia, 50% in South 
America to less than 20% in Europe, North America and Oceania. 
Under current projections, efforts to intensify wood production in 
plantation forests, together with increases in fuel-use efficiency and 
electrification, are suggested to only partly alleviate the pressure on 
native forests (Barger et al. 2018). Nevertheless, the area of forest 
under management plans has increased in all regions since 2000 
industrial wood production, forests certified under sustainable forest 
management programmes accounted for 51% of total managed 
forest area in 2017, an increase from 11% in 2000 (ICFPA 2021).
7.3.2 Anthropogenic Direct Drivers – Agriculture
7.3.2.1 Livestock Populations and Management
Enteric fermentation dominates agricultural CH 4 emissions 
(Section  7.2.3) with emissions being a  function of both ruminant 
animal numbers and productivity (output per animal). In addition 
to enteric fermentation, both CH 4 and N 2O emissions from manure 
management (i.e., manure storage and application) and deposition 
on pasture, make livestock the main agricultural emissions source 
(Tubiello 2019). The AR5 reported increases in populations of all 
major livestock categories between the 1970s and 2000s, including 
ruminants, with increasing numbers directly linked with increasing 
CH4 emissions (Smith et al. 2014). The SRCCL identified managed 
pastures as a disproportionately high N 2O emissions source within 
grazing lands, with medium confidence that increased manure 
production and deposition was a key driver (Jia et al. 2019). The latest 
data (FAO 2021c) indicate continued global livestock population 
growth between 1990 and 2019 (Figure  7.10), including increases 
of 18% in cattle and buffalo numbers, and 30% in sheep and goat 
numbers, corresponding with CH 4 emission trends. Data also indicate 
increased productivity per animal for example, average increases of 
16% in beef, 17% in pig meat and 70% in whole (cow) milk per 
respective animal between 1990 and 2019 (FAO 2021c). Despite these 
advances leading to reduced emissions per unit of product (calories, 
meat and milk) (FAO 2016; Tubiello 2019), increased individual 
animal productivity generally requires increased inputs (e.g.,  feed) 
and this generates increased emissions (Beauchemin et al. 2020). 
Manipulation of livestock diets, or improvements in animal genetics 
or health may counteract some of this. In addition, the production of 
inputs to facilitate increased animal productivity, may indirectly drive 
further absolute GHG emissions along the feed supply chain.
Although there are several potential drivers (McDermott et al. 2010; 
Alary et al. 2015), increased livestock production is principally in 
response to growth in demand for animal-sourced food, driven by 
a growing human population (FAO, 2019) and increased consumption 
resulting from changes in affluence, notably in middle-income 
countries (Godfray et al. 2018). Available data document increases 
in total meat and milk consumption by 24 and 22% respectively 
between 1990 and 2013, as indicated by average annual per capita 
supply (FAO 2017a). Updated data indicate that trends of increasing 
consumption continued between 2014 and 2018 (FAO 2021d). 
Sustained demand for animal-sourced food is expected to drive 
further livestock sector growth, with global production projected to 
expand by 14% by 2029, facilitated by maintained product prices and 
lower feed prices (OECD/FAO 2019).7.3.2.2 Rice Cultivation
In addition to livestock, both AR5 and the SRCCL identified paddy 
rice cultivation as an important emissions source (Smith et al. 2014), 
with medium evidence and high agreement that its expansion is 
a key driver of growing trends in atmospheric CH 4 concentration (Jia 
et al. 2019). The latest data indicate the global harvested area of rice 
to have grown by 11% between 1990 and 2019, with total paddy 
production increasing by 46%, from 519 Mt to 755 Mt (FAO 2021c). 
Global rice production is projected to increase by 13% by 2028 
compared to 2019 levels (OECD/FAO 2019). However, yield increases 
are expected to limit cultivated area expansion, while dietary shifts 
from rice to protein as a result of increasing per capita income, is 
expected to reduce demand in certain regions, with a slight decline 
in related emissions projected to 2030 (USEPA 2019).
Between 1990 and 2019, Africa recorded the greatest increase 
(+160%) in area under rice cultivation, followed by Asia and the 
Pacific (+6%), with area reductions evident in all other regions 
(FAO 2021c) broadly corresponding with related regional CH 4 
emission (Figures  7.3 and 7.8). Data indicate the greatest growth 
in consumption (average annual supply per capita) between 1990 
and 2013 to have occurred in Eastern Europe and West Central Asia 
(+42%) followed by Africa (+25%), with little change (+1%) observed 
in Asia and the Pacific (FAO 2017a). Most of the projected increase 
in global rice consumption is in Africa and Asia (OECD/FAO 2019).
7.3.2.3 Synthetic Fertiliser Use
Both AR5 and the SRCCL described considerable increases in global 
use of synthetic nitrogen fertilisers since the 1970s, which was 
identified to be a major driver of increasing N 2O emissions (Jia et al. 
2019). The latest data document a 41% increase in global nitrogen 
fertiliser use between 1990 and 2019 (FAO 2021e) corresponding 
with associated increased N 2O emissions (Figure  7.3). Increased 
fertiliser use has been driven by pursuit of increased crop yields, with 
for example, a 61% increase in average global cereal yield per hectare 
observed during the same period (FAO 2021c), achieved through 
both increased fertiliser use and varietal improvements. Increased 
yields are in response to increased demand for food, feed, fuel 
and fibre crops which in turn has been driven by a growing human 
population (FAO, 2019), increased demand for animal-sourced food 
and bioenergy policy (OECD/FAO 2019). Global crop production is 
projected to increase by almost 15% over the next decade, with low 
income and emerging regions with greater availability of land and 
labour resources expected to experience the strongest growth, and 
account for about 50% of global output growth (OECD/FAO 2019). 
Increases in global nitrogen fertiliser use are also projected, notably 
in low income and emerging regions (USEPA 2019).

The indirect drivers behind how humans both use and impact 
natural resources are outlined in Table 7.2. Specifically; demographic, economic and cultural, scientific and technological, and institutional 
and governance drivers. These indirect drivers not only interact with 
each other at different temporal and spatial scales but are also subject 
to impacts and feedbacks from the direct drivers (Barger et al. 2018).
Table 7.2 | Indirect drivers of anthropogenic land and natural resource use patterns.
DemographyGlobal and regional trends in population growth: There was a 43% increase in global population between 1990 and 2018. The greatest 
growth was observed in Africa and the Middle East (+104%) and least growth in Eastern Europe and West-Central Asia (+7%) (FAO 2019b).
Global and regional projections: Population is projected to increase by 28% between 2018 and 2050 reaching 9.7 billion (FAO 2019). 
The world’s population is expected to become older, more urbanised and live in smaller households (UNEP 2019).
Human migration: Growing mobility and population are linked to human migration, a powerful driver of changes in land and resource use 
patterns at decadal time scales, with the dominant flow of people being from rural areas to urban settlements over the past few decades, 
notably in the developing world (Adger et al. 2015; Barger et al. 2018).
Economic development  
and cultural factorsChanges in land use and management come from individual and social responses to economic opportunities (e.g., demand for a particular 
commodity or improved market access), mediated by institutions and policies (e.g., agricultural subsidies and low-interest credit or 
government-led infrastructure projects) (Barger et al. 2018).
Projections on consumption: If the future global population adopts a per capita consumption rate similar to that of the developed 
world, the global capacity to provide land-based resources will be exceeded (Barger et al. 2018). Economic growth in the developing world 
is projected to double the global consumption of forest and wood products by 2030, with demand likely to exceed production in many 
developing and emerging economies in Asia and Africa within the next decade (Barger et al. 2018).
Global trade: Market distorting agricultural subsidies and globalisation increases pressure on land systems and functions, with global 
trade and capital flow influencing land use, notably in developing countries (Furumo and Aide 2017; Yao et al. 2018; Pendrill et al. 2019a; 
UNEP 2019, OECD/FAO 2019). Estimates suggest that between 29 and 39% of emissions from deforestation in the tropics resulted from 
the international trade of agricultural commodities (Pendrill et al. 2019a).
Science and technologyTechnological factors operates in conjunction with economic drivers of land use and management, whether through intensified farming 
techniques and biotechnology, high-input approaches to rehabilitating degraded land (e.g., Lin et al. 2017; Guo et al. 2020) or through new 
forms of data collection and monitoring (e.g., Song et al. 2018; Thyagharajan and Vignesh 2019; Arévalo et al. 2020). 
Changes in farming and forestry systems: Changes can have both positive and negative impacts regarding multiple factors, including GHG 
emission trends. Fast advancing technologies shape production and consumption, and drive land-use patterns and terrestrial ecosystems at 
various scales. Innovation is expected to help drive increases in global crop production during the next decade (OECD/FAO 2019). For example, 
emerging gene editing technologies, may advance crop breeding capabilities, though are subject to biosafety, public acceptance and regulatory 
approval (Jaganathan et al. 2018; Chen et al. 2019; Schmidt et al. 2020). Technological changes were significant for the expansion of soybean 
in Brazil by adapting to different soils and photoperiods (Abrahão and Costa 2018). In Asia, technological development changed agriculture 
with significant improvements in production and adaptation to climate change (Thomson et al. 2019; Giller and Ewert 2019; Anderson et al. 
2020; Cassman and Grassini 2020). Developments such as precision agriculture and drip irrigation have facilitated more efficient agrochemical 
and water use (UNEP 2019).
Research and development are central to forest restoration strategies that have become increasingly important around the world as costs 
vary depending on methods used, from natural regeneration with native tree species to active restoration using site preparation and planting 
(Löf et al. 2019). In addition, climate change poses the challenge about tree species selection in the future. Innovations in the forest sector 
also form the basis of a bioeconomy associated with bioproducts and new processes (Verkerk et al. 2020) (Cross-Working Group Box 3 
in Chapter 12).
Emerging mitigation technologies: Chemically synthesised methanogen inhibitors for ruminants are expected to be commercially 
available in some countries within the next two years and have considerable CH 4 mitigation potential (McGinn et al. 2019; Melgar et al. 
2020; Beauchemin et al. 2020; Reisinger et al. 2021) (Section 7.4.3). There is growing literature (in both academic and non-academic spheres) 
on the biological engineering of protein. Although in its infancy and subject to investment, technological development, regulatory approval 
and consumer acceptance, it is suggested to have the potential to disrupt current livestock production systems and land use (Stephens et al. 
2018; Ben-Arye and Levenberg 2019; RethinkX 2019; Post et al. 2020). The extent to which this is possible and the overall climate benefits 
are unclear (Lynch and Pierrehumbert 2019; Chriki and Hocquette 2020).  
Institutions and governanceInstitutional factors often moderate the relevance and impact of changes in economic and demographic variables related to resource 
exploitation and use. Institutions encompass the rule of law, legal frameworks and other social structures (e.g., civil society networks and 
movements) determining land management (e.g., formal and informal property rights, regimes and their enforcement); information and 
knowledge exchange systems; local and traditional knowledge and practice systems (Barger et al. 2018).
Land rights: Land tenure often allows communities to exercise traditional governance based on traditional ecological knowledge, devolved 
and dynamic access rights, judicious use, equitable distribution of benefits (Mantyka-Pringle et al. 2017; Wynberg 2017; Thomas et al. 2017), 
biodiversity (Contreras-Negrete et al. 2014) and fire and grazing management (Levang et al. 2015; Varghese et al. 2015).
Agreements and Finance: Since AR5, global agreements were reached on climate change, sustainable development goals, and the 
mobilisation of finance for development and climate action. Several countries adopted policies and commitments to restore degraded 
land (Barger et al. 2018). The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), launched 
the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (https://www.decadeonrestoration.org/).
Companies have also made pledges to reduce impacts on forests and on the rights of local communities as well as eliminating deforestation 
from their supply chains. The finance sector, a crucial driver behind action (Section 7.6, Box 7.12), has also started to make explicit 
commitments to avoiding environmental damage (Barger et al. 2018) and net zero targets (Forest Trends Ecosystem Marketplace 2021), 
though investment is sensitive to market outlook.
Measures Including Trade-
offs and Synergies
AFOLU mitigation or land-based climate change mitigation (used in 
this chapter interchangeably) are a variety of land management or 
demand management practices that reduce GHG emissions and/or 
enhance carbon sequestration within the land system (i.e., in forests, 
wetlands, grasslands, croplands and pasturelands). If implemented 
with benefits to human well-being and biodiversity, land-based 
mitigation measures are often referred to as nature-based solutions 
and/or natural climate solutions (Glossary). Measures that result in 
a net removal of GHGs from the atmosphere and storage in either 
living or dead organic material, or in geological stores, are known 
as CDR, and in previous IPCC reports were sometimes referred to as 
greenhouse gas removal (GGR) or negative emissions technologies 
(NETs) (Rogelj et al. 2018a; Jia et al. 2019). This section evaluates 
current knowledge and latest scientific literature on AFOLU 
mitigation measures and potentials, including land-based CDR 
measures. Section 7.4.1 provides an overview of the approaches for 
estimating mitigation potential, the co-benefits and risks from land-
based mitigation measures, estimated global and regional mitigation 
potential and associated costs according to literature published over 
the last decade. Subsequent subsections assess literature on 20 key 
AFOLU mitigation measures specifically providing:
• A description of activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation 
opportunities and barriers.
• A summary of conclusions in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report 
(AR5) and IPCC Special Reports (Special Report on Climate 
Change of 1.5°C (SR1.5), Special Report on the Ocean and 
Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) and Special Report 
on Climate Change and Land (SRCCL)).
• An overview of literature and developments since the AR5 and 
IPCC Special Reports.
• An assessment and conclusion based on current evidence.
Measures are categorised as supply-side activities in: (i) forests and 
other ecosystems (Section  7.4.2); (ii) agriculture (Section  7.4.3); 
(iii) bioenergy and other land-based energy technologies (Section 7.4.4); 
as well as (iv) demand-side activities (Section 7.4.5 and Figure 7.11). 
Several information boxes are dispersed within the section and 
provide supporting material, including case studies exploring a range 
of topics from climate-smart forestry in Europe (Box 7.2), agroforestry 
in Brazil (Box 7.3), climate-smart village approaches (Box 7.4), farm 
systems approaches (Box  7.5), mitigation within Indian agriculture 
(Box 7.6), and bioenergy and BECCS mitigation calculations (Box 7.7). 
Novel measures, including enhanced weathering and novel foods are 
covered in Chapter  12, this report. In addition, as mitigation within 
AFOLU concerns land management and use of land resources, AFOLU 
measures impact other sectors. Accordingly, AFOLU measures are 
also discussed in other sectoral chapters within this report, notably 
demand-side solutions (Chapter  5), bioenergy and bioenergy with 
carbon capture and storage (BECCS) (Chapter  6), the use of wood 
products and biomass in buildings (Chapter  9), and CDR measures, 
food systems and land related impacts, risks and opportunities of 
mitigation measures (Chapter 12).7.4.1 Introduction and Overview 
of Mitigation Potential
7.4.1.1 Estimating Mitigation Potentials
Mitigation potentials for AFOLU measures are estimated by 
calculating the scale of emissions reductions or carbon sequestration 
against a counterfactual scenario without mitigation activities. The 
types of mitigation potential estimates in recent literature include: 
(i) technical potential (the biophysical potential or amount possible 
with current technologies); (ii) economic potential (constrained by 
costs, usually by a  given carbon price (Table  7.3); (iii) sustainable 
potential (constrained by environmental safeguards and/or natural 
resources, e.g., limiting natural forest conversion), and (iv) feasible 
potential (constrained by environmental, socio-cultural, and/or 
institutional barriers), however, there are no set definitions used in 
literature. In addition to types of mitigation estimates, there are two 
AFOLU mitigation categories often calculated: supply-side measures 
(land management interventions) and demand-side measures 
(interventions that require a change in consumer behaviour).
Two main approaches to estimating mitigation potentials include: 
(i) studies on individual measures and/or sectors  – henceforth 
referred to as sectoral assessments, and (ii) integrated assessment 
models (IAM). Sectoral assessments include studies focusing on one 
activity (e.g.,  agroforestry) based on spatial and biophysical data, 
as well as econometric and optimisation models for a  sector, for 
example, the forest or agriculture sector, and therefore cover a large 
suite of practices and activities while representing a broad body of 
literature. Sectoral assessments, however, rarely capture cross-sector 
interactions or impacts, making it difficult to completely account for 
land competition, trade-offs, and double counting when aggregating 
sectoral estimates across different studies and methods (Smith et al. 
2014; Jia et al. 2019). On the other hand, IAMs assess the climate 
impact of multiple and interlinked practices across sectors and 
therefore, can account for interactions and trade-offs (including land 
competition, use of other resources and international trade) between 
them. However, the number of land-based measures used in IAMs 
are limited compared with the sectoral portfolio (Figure 7.11). The 
resolution of land-based measures in IAMs are also generally coarser 
compared to some sectoral estimates, and as such, may be less 
robust for individual measures (Roe et al. 2021). Given the differences 
between and strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches, it is 
helpful to compare the estimates from both. We combine estimates 
from both approaches to establish an updated range of global land-
based mitigation potential.
For the 20 land-based mitigation measures outlined in this section, 
the mitigation potential estimates are largely derived from sectoral 
approaches, and where data is available, are compared to IAM 
estimates. Integrated assessment models and the emissions 
trajectories, cost-effectiveness and trade-offs of various mitigation 
pathways are detailed in Section  7.5.  It should be noted that the 
underlying literature for sectoral as well as IAM mitigation estimates 
consider GWP100 IPCC AR5 values (CH 4 = 28, N 2O = 265) as well 
as GWP100 IPCC AR4 values (CH 4 = 25, N 2O = 298) to convert CH 4 
and N 2O to CO 2-eq. Where possible, we note the various GWP100  
however in some instances, the varying GWP100  values used across 
studies prevents description of non-CO 2 gases in native units as well 
as conversion to AR6 GWP100 (CH 4 = 27, N 2O = 273) CO 2-eq values 
to aggregate sectoral assessment estimates.
7.4.1.2 Co-benefits and Risks
Land interventions have interlinked implications for climate mitigation, 
adaptation, food security, biodiversity, ecosystem services, and other 
environmental and societal challenges (Section 7.6.5). Therefore, it 
is important to consider the net effect of mitigation measures for 
achieving both climate and non-climate goals (Section 7.1).
While it is helpful to assess the general benefits, risks and 
opportunities possible for land-based mitigation measures 
(L.G. Smith et al. 2019), their efficacy and scale of benefit or risk 
largely depends on the type of activity undertaken, deployment 
strategy (e.g.,  scale, method), and context (e.g.,  soil, biome, 
climate, food system, land ownership) that vary geographically 
and over time (robust evidence,  high agreement)  (L.G. Smith et al. 
2019; P .  Smith et al. 2019a; Hurlbert et al. 2019) (Section  12.5). 
Impacts of land-based mitigation measures are therefore highly 
context specific and conclusions from specific studies may not be 
universally applicable. If implemented at appropriate scales and 
in a  sustainable manner, land-based mitigation practices have 
the capacity to reduce emissions and sequester billions of tonnes 
of carbon from the atmosphere over coming decades, while also 
preserving or enhancing biodiversity, water quality and supply, air 
quality, soil fertility, food and wood security, livelihoods, resilience 
to droughts, floods and other natural disasters, and positively 
contributing to ecosystem health and human well-being (high 
confidence) (Toensmeier 2016; Karlsson et al. 2020).
Overall, measures in the AFOLU sector are uniquely positioned to 
deliver substantial co-benefits. However, the negative consequences 
of inappropriate or misguided design and implementation of 
measures may be considerable, potentially impacting for example, 
mitigation permanence, longevity, and leakage, biodiversity, wider 
ecosystem functioning, livelihoods, food security and human well-
being (Section  7.6) (AR6 WGII, Box  2.2). Land-based mitigation 
may also face limitations and trade-offs in achieving sustained 
emission reductions and/or removals due to other land challenges 
including climate change impacts. It is widely recognised that land-
use planning that is context-specific, considers other sustainable 
development goals, and is adaptable over time can help achieve 
land-based mitigation that maximises co-benefits, avoids or limits 
trade-offs, and delivers on international policy goals including the 
SDGs, Land Degradation Neutrality, and Convention on Biological 
Diversity (Section 7.6; Chapter 12).
Potential co-benefits and trade-offs are outlined for each of the 

and summarised in Figure 7.12. Section 7.6.5. discusses general links 
with ecosystem services, human well-being and adaptation, while 
Chapter 12 (Section 12.5) provides an in-depth assessment of the land 
related impacts, risks and opportunities associated with mitigation options across sectors, including positive and negative effects on 
land resources, water, biodiversity, climate, and food security.
7.4.1.3 Overview of Global and Regional Technical and 
Economic Potentials in AFOLU
IPCC AR5 (2014). In the AR5, the economic mitigation potential 
of supply-side measures in the AFOLU sector was estimated 
at 7.18–10.60 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 in 2030 with carbon prices up to 
USD100 tCO 2-eq–1, about a  third of which could be achieved at 
<USD20 tCO 2-eq–1 (medium evidence, medium agreement) (Smith 
et al. 2014). The AR5 provided a  summary table of individual 
AFOLU mitigation measures, but did not conduct a  detailed 
assessment for each.
IPCC SRCCL (2019). The SRCCL assessed the full range of technical, 
economic and sustainability mitigation potentials in AFOLU for the 
period 2030–2050 and identified reduced deforestation and forest 
degradation to have greatest potential for reducing supply-side 
emissions (0.4 to 5.8 GtCO 2-eq yr–1) (high confidence) followed by 
combined agriculture measures, 0.3 to 3.4 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 (medium 
confidence) (Jia et al. 2019). For the demand-side estimates, shifting 
towards healthy, sustainable diets (0.7 to 8.0 GtCO 2-eq yr–1) (high 
confidence) had the highest potential, followed by reduced food loss 
and waste (0.8 to 4.5 GtCO 2-eq yr–1) (high confidence). Measures 
with greatest potential for CDR were afforestation/reforestation 
(0.5 to 10.1 GtCO 2-eq yr–1) (medium confidence), soil carbon 
sequestration in croplands and grasslands (0.4 to 8.6 GtCO 2-eq yr–1) 
(medium confidence) and BECCS (0.4 to 11.3 GtCO 2-eq yr–1) (medium 
confidence). The SRCCL did not explore regional potential, associated 
feasibility nor provide detailed analysis of costs.
IPCC AR6. This assessment concludes the likely range of global land-
based mitigation potential is approximately 8–14 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 
between 2020–2050 with carbon prices up to USD100 tCO 2-eq–1, 
about half of the technical potential (medium evidence, medium 
agreement). About 30–50% could be achieved <USD20 tCO 2-eq–1 
(Table  7.3). The global economic potential estimates in this 
assessment are slightly higher than the AR5 range. Since AR5, there 
have been numerous new global assessments of sectoral land-based 
mitigation potential (Fuss et al. 2018; Griscom et al. 2017, 2020; Roe 
et al. 2019; Jia et al. 2019; Griscom et al. 2020; Roe et al. 2021) as well 
as IAM estimates of mitigation potential (Riahi et al. 2017; Popp et al. 
2017; Rogelj et al. 2018a; Frank et al. 2019; Johnston and Radeloff 
2019; Baker et al. 2019), expanding the scope of AFOLU mitigation 
measures included and substantially improving the robustness and 
spatial resolution of mitigation estimates. A  recent development 
is an assessment of country-level technical and economic 
(USD100 tCO 2-eq–1) mitigation potential for 20  AFOLU measures, 
including for demand-side and soil organic carbon sequestration in 
croplands and grasslands, not estimated before (Roe  et al. 2021). 
Estimates on costs, feasibility, sustainability, benefits, and risks 
have also been developed for some mitigation measures, and they 
continue to be active areas of research. Developing more refined 
sustainable potentials at a country-level will be an important next 
step. Although most mitigation estimates still do not consider the 
impact of future climate change, there are some emerging studies 
WG1 finding that the land sink is continuing to increase although 
its efficiency is decreasing with climate change, it will be critical to 
better understand how future climate will affect mitigation potentials, 
particularly from CDR measures.
Across global sectoral studies, the economic mitigation potential 
(up to USD100 tCO 2-eq–1) of supply-side measures in AFOLU for the 
period 2020–2050 is 11.4 mean (5.6–19.8 full range) GtCO 2-eq yr–1, about 50% of the technical potential of 24.2 (4.9–58) GtCO 2-eq yr–1 
(Table 7.3). Adding 2.1 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 from demand-side measures 
(accounting only for diverted agricultural production to avoid double 
counting with land-use change effects), total land-based mitigation 
potential up to USD100 tCO 2-eq–1 is 13.6 (6.7–23.4) GtCO 2-eq yr–1. 
This estimate aligns with the most recent regional assessment (Roe 
et al. 2021), which found the aggregate global mitigation potential 
of supply and demand-side measures to be 13.8 ± 3.1 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 
up to USD100 tCO 2-eq–1 for the period 2020–2050. Across integrated 
Table 7.3 | Estimated annual mitigation potential (GtCO 2-eq yr–1) in 2020–2050 of AFOLU mitigation options by carbon price.  Estimates reflect sectoral 
studies based on a comprehensive literature review updating data from (Roe et al. 2019) and integrated assessment models using the IPCC AR6 database (Section 7.5). 
Values represent the mean, and full range of potential. Sectoral mitigation estimates are averaged for the years 2020–2050 to capture a wider range of literature, and the 
IAM estimates are given for 2050 as many model assumptions delay most land-based mitigation to mid-century. The sectoral potentials are the sum of global estimates for 
the individual measures listed for each option. IAM potentials are given for mitigation options with available data; for example, net land-use CO 2 for total forests and other 
ecosystems, and land sequestration from A/R, but not reduced deforestation (protect). Sectoral estimates predominantly use GWP100 IPCC AR5 values (CH 4 = 28, N 2O = 265), 
although some use GWP100 IPCC AR4 values (CH 4 = 25, N 2O = 298); and the IAMs use GWP100 IPCC AR6 values (CH 4 = 27, N 2O = 273). The sectoral and IAM estimates 
reflected here do not account for the substitution effects of avoiding fossil fuel emissions nor emissions from other more energy intensive resources/materials. For example, 
BECCS estimates only consider the carbon dioxide removal (CDR) via geological storage component and not potential mitigation derived from the displacement of fossil fuel 
use in the energy sector. Mitigation potential from substitution effects are included in the other sectoral chapters like energy, transport, buildings and industry. The total AFOLU 
sectoral estimate aggregates potential from agriculture, forests and other ecosystems, and diverted agricultural production from avoided food waste and diet shifts (excluding 
land-use impacts to avoid double counting). Because of potential overlaps between measures, sectoral values from BECCS and the full value chain potential from demand-side 
measures are not summed with AFOLU. IAMs account for land competition and resource optimisation and can therefore sum across all available categories to derive the total 
AFOLU potential. Key: ND = no data; Sectoral = as assessed by sectoral literature review; IAM = as assessed by integrated assessment models; EJ = exajoule primary energy.

mitigation (Agriculture, LULUCF and BECCS) for USD100 tCO 2-eq–1 
is 7.9 mean (4.1–17.3 range) GtCO 2-eq yr–1 in 2050 (Table  7.3). 
We add the estimate for BECCS here to provide the full land-
based potential, as IAMs optimise land allocation based on costs, 
which displaces land-based CDR activities for BECCS.  Combining 
both IAM and sectoral approaches, the likely range is therefore 
7.9–13.6 (rounded to 8–14) GtCO 2-eq yr–1 up to USD100 tCO 2-eq–1 
between 2020–2050. Considering both IAM and sectoral economic 
potential estimates, land-based mitigation could have the capacity 
to make the AFOLU sector net negative in GHG emissions from 2036 
(Figure 7.12), although there are highly variable mitigation strategies 
for how AFOLU potential can be deployed for achieving climate 
targets (Illustrative Mitigation Pathways in Section 7.5.5). Economic 
potential estimates, which reflect a public willingness to pay, may be 
more relevant for policy making compared with technical potentials 
which reflect a  theoretical maximum that may not be feasible 
or sustainable.
Among the mitigation options, the protection, improved management, 
and restoration of forests and other ecosystems (wetlands, savannas 
and grasslands) have the largest potential to reduce emissions 
and/or sequester carbon at 7.3 (3.9–13.1) GtCO 2-eq yr–1 (up to 
USD100 tCO 2-eq–1), with measures that ‘protect’ having the single 
highest total mitigation and mitigation densities (mitigation per 
area) in AFOLU (Table 7.3 and Figure 7.11). Agriculture provides the 
second largest share of mitigation, with 4.1 (1.7–6.7) GtCO 2-eq yr–1 
potential (up to USD100 tCO 2-eq–1), from soil carbon management 
in croplands and grasslands, agroforestry, biochar, rice cultivation, 
and livestock and nutrient management (Table 7.3 and Figure 7.11). 
Demand-side measures including shifting to sustainable healthy diets, 
reducing food waste, and improving wood products can mitigate 
2.2 (1.1–3.6) GtCO 2-eq yr–1 when accounting only for diverted 
agricultural production from diets and food waste to avoid double 
counting with measures in forests and other ecosystems (Table 7.3 
and Figure 7.11). The potential of demand-side measures increases 
three-fold, to 6.5 (4–9.5) GtCO 2-eq yr–1 when accounting for the 
entire value chain including land-use effects, but would overlap with 
other measures and is therefore not additive.
Most mitigation options are available and ready to deploy. 
Emissions reductions can be unlocked relatively quickly, whereas 
CDR need upfront investment to generate sequestration over 
time. The protection of natural ecosystems, carbon sequestration 
in agriculture, sustainable healthy diets and reduced food waste 
have especially high co-benefits and cost efficiency. Avoiding the 
conversion of carbon-rich primary peatlands, coastal wetlands and 
forests is particularly important as most carbon lost from those 
ecosystems are irrecoverable through restoration by the 2050 
timeline of achieving net zero carbon emissions (Goldstein et al. 
2020). Sustainable intensification, shifting diets, reducing food waste 
could enhance efficiencies and reduce agricultural land needs, and 
are therefore critical for enabling supply-side measures such as 
reduced deforestation, restoration, as well as reducing N 2O and CH 4 
emissions from agricultural production – as seen in the Illustrative 
Mitigation Pathway (IMP-SP) (Section  7.5.6). Although agriculture 
measures that reduce non-CO 2, particularly of CH 4, are important for near-term emissions reductions, they have less economic potential 
due to costs. Demand-side measures may be able to deliver non-CO 2 
emissions reductions more cost efficiently.
Regionally, economic mitigation potential up to USD100 tCO 2-eq–1 
is estimated to be greatest in tropical countries in Asia and Pacific 
(34%), Latin America and the Caribbean (24%), and Africa and the 
Middle East (18%) because of the large potential from reducing 
deforestation and sequestering carbon in forests and agriculture 
(Figure  7.11). However, there is also considerable potential in 
Developed Countries (18%) and more modest potential in Eastern 
Europe and West-Central Asia (5%). These results are in line with the 
IAM regional mitigation potentials (Figure 7.11). The protection of 
forests and other ecosystems is the dominant source of mitigation 
potential in tropical regions, whereas carbon sequestration 
in  agricultural land and demand-side measures are important in 
Developed Countries and Asia and Pacific. The restoration and 
management of forests and other ecosystems is more geographically 
distributed, with all regions having significant potential. Regions 
with large livestock herds (Developed Countries, Latin America) and 
rice paddy fields (Asia and Pacific) have potential to reduce CH 4. As 
expected, the highest total potential is associated with countries and 
regions with large land areas, however when considering mitigation 
density (total potential per hectare), many smaller countries, 
particularly those with wetlands have disproportionately high levels 
of mitigation for their size (Roe et al. 2021). As global commodity 
markets connect regions, AFOLU measures may create synergies and 
trade-offs across the world, which could make national demand-side 
measures for example, important in mitigating supply-side emissions 
elsewhere (Kallio et al. 2018).
Although economic potentials provide more realistic, near-term 
climate mitigation compared to technical potentials, they still do not 
account for feasibility barriers and enabling conditions that vary by 
region and country. For example, according to most models, including 
IAMs, avoided deforestation is the cheapest land-based mitigation 
option (Table 7.3, Sections 7.5.3 and 7.5.4), however implementing 
interventions aimed at reducing deforestation (including REDD+) 
often have higher transaction and implementation costs than 
expected due to various barriers and enabling conditions (Luttrell 
et al. 2018) (Section  7.6). The feasibility of implementing AFOLU 
mitigation measures, including those with multiple co-benefits, 
depends on varying economic, technological, institutional, socio-
cultural, environmental and geophysical barriers (high confidence) 
(L.G.  Smith et al. 2019). The section for each individual mitigation 
measure provides an overview of co-benefits and risks associated 
with the measure and Section 7.6.6 outlines key enabling factors and 
barriers for implementation.

7.4.2.1 Reduce Deforestation and Degradation
Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities 
and barriers. Reducing deforestation and forest degradation 
conserves existing carbon pools in forest vegetation and soil by 
avoiding tree cover loss and disturbance. Protecting forests involves 
controlling the drivers of deforestation (such as commercial and 
subsistence agriculture, mining, urban expansion) and forest 
degradation (such as overharvesting including fuelwood collection, 
poor harvesting practices, overgrazing, pest outbreaks, and extreme 
wildfires), as well as by establishing well designed, managed 
and funded protected areas (Barber et al. 2014), improving law enforcement, forest governance and land tenure, supporting 
community forest management and introducing forest certification 
(P .  Smith et al. 2019a). Reducing deforestation provides numerous 
and substantial co-benefits, preserving biodiversity and ecosystem 
services (e.g., air and water filtration, water cycling, nutrient cycling) 
more effectively and at lower costs than afforestation/reforestation 
(Jia et al. 2019). Potential adverse side effects of these conservation 
measures include reducing the potential for agriculture land 
expansion, restricting the rights and access of local people to forest 
resources, or increasing the dependence of local people to insecure 
external funding. Barriers to implementation include unclear land 
tenure, weak environmental governance, insufficient funds, and 
increasing pressures associated to agriculture conversion, resource 
exploitation and infrastructure development (Sections 7.3 and 7.6).H4

Figure 7.12 | Historic land sector GHG flux estimates and illustrative AFOLU mitigation pathways to 2050, based on data presented in Sections 7.2, 7.4 
and 7.5. Historic trends consider both A anthropogenic (AFOLU) GHG fluxes (GtCO 2-eq yr–1) according to FAOSTAT (FAO 2021a; 2021b) and B the estimated natural land CO 2 
sink according to (Friedlingstein et al. 2020). Note that for the anthropogenic net land CO 2 flux component, several approaches and methods are described within the literature 
(Section 7.2.2) with a wide range in estimates. For clarity, only one dataset (FAOSTAT) is illustrated here. It is not intended to indicate preference for one particular method 
over others. Historic flux trends are illustrated to 2019, the latest year for which data is available. Projected economic mitigation potential (at costs of up to USD100 tCO 2-eq–1) 
includes estimates from IAMs and sectoral studies (Table 7.3). The ‘sectoral studies’ are disaggregated into several cumulative parts: first ‘sectoral studies’ involves measures 
in agriculture, forests and other ecosystems, then an additional BECCS share (‘+ BECCS’), then the additional effect of demand-side measures and BECCS (‘+BECCS and 
demand-side measures’). The latter only accounting for diverted agricultural production to avoid double counting. Projected mitigation assumes adoption of measures to achieve 
increasing, linear mitigation, reaching average annual potential in 2050, although this does not reflect deployment rates for most measures. For illustrative purposes, a pathway 
to projected emissions in 2050 according to a scenario of current policy (C7  – above 3.0°C – Model: GCAM 5.3) is additionally included for reference.Figure 7.11 (continued): Global and regional mitigation potential (GtCO 2-eq yr–1) in 2020–2050 for 20 land-based measures.  (a) Global estimates represent 
the mean (bar) and full range (error bars) of the economic potential (up to USD100 tCO 2-eq–1) based on a comprehensive literature review of sectoral studies (references are

and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. Reducing 
deforestation and forest degradation represents one of the most effective 
options for climate change mitigation, with technical potential estimated 
at 0.4–5.8 GtCO 2 yr–1 by 2050 (high confidence) (SRCCL, Chapters 2 and 
4, and Table 6.14). The higher technical estimate represents a complete 
halting of land-use conversion in forests and peatland forests (i.e., 
assuming recent rates of carbon loss are saved each year) and includes 
vegetation and soil carbon pools. Ranges of economic potentials for 
forestry ranged in AR5 from 0.01–1.45 GtCO 2 yr–1 for USD20 tCO 2–1 
to 0.2–13.8 GtCO 2 yr–1 for USD100 tCO 2–1 by 2030 with reduced 
deforestation dominating the forestry mitigation potential LAM and 
MAF , but very little potential in OECD-1990 and EIT (IPCC AR5).
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, 
SROCC and SRCCL). Since the SRCCL, several studies have provided 
updated and convergent estimates of economic mitigation potentials 
by region (Busch et al. 2019; Griscom et al. 2020; Austin et al. 2020; 
Roe et al. 2021). Tropical forests and savannas in Latin America 
provide the largest share of mitigation potential (3.9 GtCO 2 yr–1 
technical, 2.5 GtCO 2 yr–1 at USD100 tCO 2–1) followed by South-East 
Asia (2.2 GtCO 2 yr–1 technical, 1.5 GtCO 2 yr–1 at USD100 tCO 2–1) and 
Africa (2.2 GtCO 2 yr–1 technical, 1.2 GtCO 2 yr–1 at USD100 tCO 2–1) 
(Roe et al. 2021). Tropical forests continue to account for the 
highest rates of deforestation and associated GHG emissions. While 
deforestation shows signs of decreasing in several countries, 
in others, it continues at a  high rate or is increasing (Turubanova 
et al. 2018). Between 2010–2020, the rate of net forest loss was 
4.7 Mha yr–1 with Africa and South America presenting the largest 
shares (3.9 Mha and 2.6 Mha, respectively) (FAO 2020a).
A major uncertainty in all studies on avoided deforestation potential 
is their reliance on future reference levels that vary across studies and 
approaches. If food demand increases in the future, for example, the 
area of land deforested will likely increase, suggesting more technical 
potential for avoiding deforestation. Transboundary leakage due to 
market adjustments could also increase costs or reduce effectiveness 
of avoiding deforestation (e.g., Ingalls et al. 2018; Gingrich et al. 2019). 
Regarding forest regrowth, there are uncertainties about the time for 
the secondary forest carbon saturation (Houghton and Nassikas 2017; 
Zhu et al. 2018). Permanence of avoided deforestation may also be 
a  concern due to the impacts of climate change and disturbance of 
other biogeochemical cycles on the world’s forests that can result in 
future potential changes in terrestrial ecosystem productivity, climate-
driven vegetation migration, wildfires, forest regrowth and carbon 
dynamics (Ballantyne et al. 2012; Kim et al. 2017b; Lovejoy and Nobre 
2018; Aragão et al. 2018).
Critical assessment and conclusion. Based on studies since 
AR5, the technical mitigation potential for reducing deforestation 
and degradation is significant, providing 4.5 (2.3–7) GtCO 2 yr–1 
globally by 2050, of which 3.4 (2.3–6.4) GtCO 2 yr–1 is available at 
below USD100 tCO 2–1 (medium confidence) (Figure  7.11). Over the 
last decade, hundreds of subnational initiatives that aim to reduce 
deforestation related emissions have been implemented across the 
tropics (Section  7.6). Reduced deforestation is a  significant piece of 
the NDCs in the Paris Agreement (Seddon et al. 2020) and keeping 
the temperature below 1.5°C (Crusius 2020). Conservation of forests provides multiple co-benefits linked to ecosystem services, biodiversity 
and sustainable development (Section  7.6.). Still, ensuring good 
governance, accountability (e.g., enhanced monitoring and verification 
capacity; Bos 2020), and the rule of law are crucial for implementing 
forest-based mitigation options. In many countries with the highest 
deforestation rates, insecure land rights often are significant barriers for 
forest-based mitigation options (Gren and Zeleke 2016; Essl et al. 2018).
7.4.2.2 Afforestation, Reforestation and Forest 
Ecosystem Restoration
Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities 
and barriers. Afforestation and reforestation (A/R) are activities that 
convert land to forest, where reforestation is on land that has previously 
contained forests, while afforestation is on land that historically has 
not been forested (Box  7.2). Forest restoration refers to a  form of 
reforestation that gives more priority to ecological integrity as well, 
even though it can still be a managed forest. Depending on the location, 
scale, and choice and management of tree species, A/R activities have 
a wide variety of co-benefits and trade-offs. Well-planned, sustainable 
reforestation and forest restoration can enhance climate resilience 
and biodiversity, and provide a variety of ecosystem services including 
water regulation, microclimatic regulation, soil erosion protection, 
as well as renewable resources, income and livelihoods (Locatelli 
et al. 2015; Stanturf et al. 2015; Ellison et al. 2017; Verkerk et al. 2020). 
Afforestation, when well planned, can help address land degradation 
and desertification by reducing runoff and erosion and lead to cloud 
formation however, when not well planned, there are localised trade-
offs such as reduced water yield or biodiversity (Teuling et al. 2017; 
Ellison et al. 2017). The use of non-native species and monocultures may 
have adverse impacts on ecosystem structure and function, and water 
availability, particularly in dry regions (Ellison et al. 2017). A/R activities 
may change the surface albedo and evapotranspiration regimes, 
producing net cooling in the tropical and subtropical latitudes for local 
and global climate and net warming at high latitudes (Section 7.4.2). 
Very large-scale implementation of A/R may negatively affect food 
security since an increase in global forest area can increase food prices 
through land competition (Kreidenweis et al. 2016).
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC 
and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. The  AR5 
did not provide a new specification of A/R potential, but referred to 
IPCC AR4 mostly for forestry measures (Nabuurs et al. 2007). The AR5 
did view the feasible A/R potential from a diets change scenario that 
released land for reforestation and bioenergy crops. The AR5 provided 
top-down estimates of costs and potentials for forestry mitigation 
options  – including reduced deforestation, forest management, 
afforestation, and agroforestry, estimated to contribute between 1.27 
and 4.23 GtCO 2 yr–1 of economically viable abatement in 2030 at 
carbon prices up to USD100 tCO 2-eq–1 (Smith et al. 2014).
The SRCCL remained with a  reported wide range of mitigation 
potential for A/R of 0.5–10.1 GtCO 2 yr–1 by 2050 (medium confidence) 
(Kreidenweis et al. 2016; Griscom et al. 2017; Hawken 2017; Fuss et al. 
2018; Roe et al. 2019) (SRCCL Chapters 2 and 6). The higher estimate 
represents a technical potential of reforesting all areas where forests 
are the native cover type (reforestation), constrained by food security 
and biodiversity considerations, considering above and below-ground 
of 678 Mha of land (Griscom et al. 2017; Roe et al. 2019). The lower 
estimates represent the minimum range from an Earth System Model 
and a  sustainable global CDR potential (Fuss et al. 2018). Climate 
change will affect the mitigation potential of reforestation due to 
impacts in forest growth and composition, as well as changes in 
disturbances including fire. However, none of the mitigation estimates 
included in the SRCCL account for climate impacts.
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, 
SROCC and SRCCL). Since SRCCL, additional studies have been 
published on A/R mitigation potential by Bastin et al. (2019), Lewis 
et al. (2019), Doelman et al. (2019), Favero et al. (2020) and Austin 
et al. (2020). These studies are within the range reported in the 
SRCCL stretching the potentials at the higher range. The rising public 
interest in nature-based solutions, along with high profile initiatives 
being launched (UN Decade on Restoration announced in 2019, the 
Bonn challenge on 150 million ha of restored forest in 2020 and the 
one trillion trees campaign launched by the World Economic Forum in 
2020), has prompted intense discussions on the scale, effectiveness, 
and pitfalls of A/R and tree planting for climate mitigation (Luyssaert 
et al. 2018; Bond et al. 2019; Anderegg et al. 2020; Heilmayr et al. 
2020; Holl and Brancalion 2020). The sometimes sole attention on 
afforestation and reforestation – suggesting it may solve the climate 
problem to large extent, in combination with the very high estimates 
of potentials – have led to polarisation in the debate, resulting in 
criticism to these measures or an emphasis on nature restoration only 
(Lewis et al. 2019). Our assessment based on most recent literature 
produced regional economic mitigation potential at USD100 tCO 2–1 
estimate of 100–400 MtCO 2 yr–1 in Africa, 210–266 MtCO 2 yr–1 in Asia 
and Pacific, 291 MtCO 2-eq yr–1 in Developed Countries (87% in North 
America), 30 MtCO 2-eq yr–1 in Eastern Europe and West-Central Asia, 
and 345–898 MtCO 2-eq yr–1 in Latin America and Caribbean (Roe 
et al. 2021), which totals to about 1200 MtCO 2 yr–1, leaning to the 
lower range of the potentials in earlier IPCC reports. A recent global 
assessment of the aggregate costs for afforestation and reforestation 
suggests that at USD100 tCO 2–1, 1.6 GtCO 2 yr–1 could be sequestered 
globally for an annual cost of USD130 billion (Austin et al. 2020). 
Sectoral studies that are able to deal with local circumstances and 
limits estimate A/R potentials at 20 MtCO 2 yr–1 in Russia (Eastern 
Europe and West-Central Asia) (Romanovskaya et al. 2020) and 

estimated for the USA an additional 20% sequestration rate from 
tree planting to achieve full stocking capacity of all understocked 
productive forestland, in total reaching 187 MtCO 2 yr–1 sequestration. 
A new study on costs in the USA estimates 72–91 MtCO 2 yr–1 could be 
sequestered between now and 2050 for USD100 tCO 2–1 (Wade et al. 
2019). The tropical and subtropical latitudes are the most effective 
for forest restoration in terms of carbon sequestration because of the 
rapid growth and lower albedo of the land surface compared with 
high latitudes (Lewis et al. 2019). Costs may be higher if albedo is 
considered in North America, Russia, and Africa (Favero et al. 2017). 
In addition, a wide variety of sequestration rates have been collected 
and published in the IPCC Good Practice Guidance for the AFOLU 
sector (IPCC 2006).
Critical assessment and conclusion. There is medium 
confidence that the global technical mitigation potential of afforestation and reforestation activities by 2050 is 3.9 
(0.5–10.1) GtCO 2 yr–1, and the economic mitigation potential 
(<USD100 tCO 2–1) is 1.6   (0.5–3.0)  GtCO 2  yr–1 (requiring about 

5–10 t CO 2 ha–1 yr–1 is realistic with ranges between 1–20 t(CO 2) ha–1 
yr–1. Not all sectoral studies rely on economic models that account for 
leakage (Murray et al. 2004; Sohngen and Brown 2004), suggesting 
that technical potential may be overestimated.
7.4.2.3 Improved Forest Management
Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities 
and barriers. Improved sustainable forest management of already 
managed forests can lead to higher forest carbon stocks, better 
quality of produced wood, continuously produced wood, while 
maintaining and enhancing the forest carbon stock, and can also 
partially prevent and counteract the impacts of disturbances (Kurz 
et al. 2008; Marlon et al. 2012; Abatzoglou and Williams 2016; Seidl 
et al. 2017; Nabuurs et al. 2017; Tian et al. 2018; Ekholm 2020). 
Furthermore, it can provide benefits for climate change adaptation, 
biodiversity conservation, microclimatic regulation, soil erosion 
protection and water and flood regulation with reduced lateral 
carbon fluxes (Ashton et al. 2012; Martínez-Mena et al. 2019; Verkerk 
et al. 2020). Often, in existing (managed) forests with existing 
carbon stocks, large changes per hectare cannot be expected, 
although many forest owners may respond to carbon price incentives 
(Favero et al. 2020; Ekholm 2020). The full mitigation effects can be 
assessed in conjunction with the overall forest and wood use system 
i.e., carbon stock changes in standing trees, soil, harvested wood 
products (HWPs) and its bioenergy component with the avoided 
emissions through substitution. Forest management strategies aimed 
at increasing the biomass stock may have adverse side effects, such 
as decreasing the stand-level structural complexity, large emphasis 
on pure fast-growing stands, risks for biodiversity and resilience to 
natural disasters.
Generally, measures can consist of one or combination of longer 
rotations, less intensive harvests, continuous-cover forestry, mixed 
stands, more adapted species, selected provenances, high quality 
wood assortments, and so on. Further, there is a trade-off between 
management in various parts of the forest product value chain, 
resulting in a wide range of results on the role of managed forests in 
mitigation (Agostini et al. 2013; Braun et al. 2016; Soimakallio et al. 
2016; Gustavsson et al. 2017; Erb et al. 2017; Favero et al. 2020; 
Hurmekoski et al. 2020). Some studies conclude that reduction in 
forest carbon stocks due to harvest exceeds for decades the joint 
sequestration of carbon in harvested wood product stocks and 
emissions avoided through wood use (Soimakallio et al. 2016; Seppälä 
et al. 2019), whereas others emphasise country level examples where 
investments in forest management have led to higher growing stocks 
while producing more wood (Schulze et al. 2020; Ouden et al. 2020; 
Cowie et al. 2021).
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC 
and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. In the 
SRCCL, forest management activities have the potential to mitigate 
0.4–2.1 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 by 2050 (medium confidence) (SRCCL: 
Griscom et al. 2017; Roe et al. 2019). The higher estimate stems from 
managed forest  which can be seen as very optimistic. It combines 
both natural forest management as well as improved plantations, on 
average with a small net additional effect per hectare, not including 
substitution effects in the energy sector nor the buildings sector.
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, 
SROCC and SRCCL). The area of forest under management plans 
has increased in all regions since 2000 by 233 Mha (FAO 2020e). The 
roughly 1 billion ha of secondary and degraded forests would be ideal 
to invest in and develop a sustainable sector that pays attention to 
biodiversity, wood provision and climate mitigation at the same time. 
This all depends on the effort made, the development of expertise, 
know-how in the field, nurseries with adapted provenances, etc as 
was also found for Russian climate-smart forestry options (Leskinen 
et al. 2020). Regionally, recently updated economic mitigation 
potential at USD100 tCO 2–1 have 179–186 MtCO 2-eq yr–1 in Africa, 
193–313 MtCO 2-eq yr–1 in Asia and Pacific, 215–220 MtCO 2-eq yr–1 
in Developed Countries , 82–152 MtCO 2-eq yr–1 in Eastern Europe 
and West-Central Asia, and 62–204 MtCO 2-eq yr–1 in Latin America 
and Caribbean (Roe et al. 2021).
Regional studies can take into account the local situation better: 
Russia Romanovskaya et al. (2020) estimate the potential of forest 
fires management at 220–420 MtCO 2 yr–1, gentle logging technology 
at 15–59, reduction of wood losses at 61–76 MtCO 2 yr–1. In North 
America, (Austin et al. 2020) estimate that in the next 30 years, 
forest management could contribute 154 MtCO 2 yr–1 in the USA and 
Canada with 81 MtCO 2 yr–1 available at less than USD100 tCO 2–1. In 
one production region (British Columbia) a cost-effective portfolio of 
scenarios was simulated that directed more of the harvested wood 
to longer-lived wood products, stopped burning of harvest residues 
and instead produced bioenergy to displace fossil fuel burning, and 
reduced harvest levels in regions with low disturbance rates. Net 
GHG emissions were reduced by an average of –9 MtCO 2-eq yr–1 (Smyth et al. 2020). In Europe, climate-smart forestry could mitigate 
an additional 0.19 GtCO 2 yr–1 by 2050 (Nabuurs et al. 2017), in line 
with the regional estimates in (Roe et al. 2021).
In the tropics, estimates of the pantropical climate mitigation potential 
of natural forest management (a light intensity management in 
secondary forests), across three tropical regions (Latin America, 
Africa, Asia), is around 0.66 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 with Asia responding for 
the largest share followed by Africa and Latin America (Roe et al. 
2021). Selective logging occurs in at least 20% of the world’s tropical 
forests and causes at least half of the emissions from tropical forest 
degradation (Asner et al. 2005; Blaser and Küchli 2011; Pearson 
et al. 2017). Reduced-impact logging for climate (RIL-C; promotion 
of reduced wood waste, narrower haul roads, and lower impact 
skidding equipment) has the potential to reduce logging emissions 
by 44% (Ellis et al. 2019), while also providing timber production.
Critical assessment and conclusion. There is medium confidence 
that the global technical mitigation potential for improved forest 
management by 2050 is 1.7 (1–2.1) GtCO 2 yr–1, and the economic 
mitigation potential (<USD100 tCO 2–1) is 1.1 (0.6–1.9) GtCO 2 yr–1. 
Efforts to change forest management do not only require, for example, 
a carbon price incentive, but especially require knowledge, institutions, 
skilled labour, good access and so on. These requirements outline 
that although the potential is of medium size, we estimate a feasible 
potential towards the lower end. The net effect is also difficult to 
assess, as management changes impact not only the forest biomass, 
but also the wood chain and substitution effects. Further, leakage can 
arise from efforts to change management for carbon sequestration. 
Efforts, for example to set aside large areas of forest, may be partly 
counteracted by higher harvesting pressures elsewhere (Kallio 
et al. 2018). Studies such as (Austin et al. 2020) implicitly account 
for leakage and thus suggest higher costs than other studies. We 
therefore judge the mitigation potential at medium potential with 
medium agreement.
Box 7.2 | Climate-smart Forestry in Europe
Summary
European forests have been regarded as prospering and increasing for the last five decades. However, these views also changed 
recently. Climate change is putting a large pressure on mono species and high stocked areas of Norway spruce in Central Europe 
(Hlásny et al. 2021; Senf and Seidl 2021) with estimates of mortality reaching 200 million m3, biodiversity under pressure, the 
Mediterranean area showing a weak sector and harvesting pressure in the Baltics and north reaching maxima achievable. A European 
strategy for unlocking the EU’s forests and forest sector potential was needed at the time of developing the LULUCF regulation and 
was based on the concept of ‘climate-smart forestry’ (CSF) (Nabuurs et al. 2017; Verkerk et al. 2020).
Background
The idea behind CSF is that it considers the whole value chain from forest to wood products and energy, illustrating that a wide range 
of measures can be applied to provide positive incentives for more firmly integrating climate objectives into the forest and forest 
sector framework. CSF is more than just storing carbon in forest ecosystems; it builds upon three main objectives; (i) reducing and/
or removing GHG emissions; (ii) adapting and building diverse forests for forest resilience to climate change; and (iii) sustainably 
increasing forest productivity and incomes. These three CSF objectives can be achieved by tailoring policy measures and actions to 
regional circumstances in member states’ forest sectors.
Savanna Fires)
Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities 
and barriers. Fire management objectives include safeguarding life, 
property, and resources through the prevention, detection, control, 
restriction, and management of fire for diverse purposes in natural 
ecosystems (SRCCL, Chapter  6). Controlled burning is an effective 
economic method of reducing fire danger and stimulating natural 
regeneration. Co-benefits of fire management include reduced air 
pollution compared to much larger, uncontrolled fires, prevention 
of soil erosion and land degradation, biodiversity conservation 
in rangelands, and improvement of forage quality (Hurteau and 
Brooks 2011; Falk 2017; Hurteau et al. 2019). Fire management is 
still challenging because it is not only fire suppression at times of 
fire, but especially proper natural resource management in between 
fire events. Furthermore, it is challenging because of legal and 
policy issues, equity and rights concerns, governance, capacity, and 
research needs (Wiedinmyer and Hurteau 2010; Goldammer 2016; 
Russell-Smith et al. 2017). It will increasingly be needed under future 
enhanced climate change.
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC 
and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. In the 
SRCCL, fire management is among the nine options that can deliver 
medium-to-large benefits across multiple land challenges (climate 
change mitigation, adaptation, desertification, land degradation, and 
food security) (high confidence). Total emissions from fires have been 
on the order of 8.1 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 in terms of gross biomass loss for 
the period 1997–2016 (SRCCL, Chapter 2, and Cross-Chapter Box 3 
in Chapter  2). Reduction in fire CO 2 emissions was calculated to 
enhance land carbon sink by 0.48 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 for the 1960–2009 
period (Arora and Melton 2018) (SRCCL, Table 6.16).Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports  
(SR1.5, SROCC and SRCCL)
Savannas. Savannas constitute one of the most fire-prone vegetation 
types on Earth and are a significant source of GHG emissions. Savanna 
fires contributed 62% (4.92 PgCO 2-eq yr–1)) of gross global mean 
fire emissions between 1997 and 2016. Regrowth from vegetation 
postfire sequesters the CO 2 released into the atmosphere, but not 
the CH 4 and N 2O emissions which contributed an approximate 
net of 2.1 PgCO 2-eq yr−1 (Lipsett-Moore et al. 2018). Therefore, 
implementing prescribed burning with low intensity fires, principally 
in the early dry season, to effectively manage the risk of wildfires 
occurring in the late dry season is associated with reducing emissions 
(Whitehead et al. 2014). Considering this fire management practice, 
estimates of global opportunities for emissions reductions were 
estimated at 69.1 MtCO 2-eq yr−1 in Africa (29 countries, with 20 least 
developed African countries accounting for 74% of the mitigation 
potential), 13.3 MtCO 2-eq yr−1 in South America (six countries), and 
6.9 MtCO 2-eq yr–1 in Australia and Papua New Guinea (Lipsett-Moore 
et al. 2018). In Australia, savanna burning emissions abatement 
methodologies have been available since 2012, and abatement has 
exceeded 9.3 MtCO 2-eq mainly through the management of low 
intensity early dry season fire. Until September 2021, 78 projects were 
registered (Australian Government, Clean Energy Regulator, 2021).
Forests. Fire is also a prevalent forest disturbance (Falk et al. 2011; 
Scott et al. 2014; Andela et al. 2019). About 98 Mha of forest were 
affected by fire in 2015, affecting about 4% of the tropical (dry) 
forests, 2% of the subtropical forests, and 1% of temperate and 
boreal forests (FAO 2020a). Between 2001–2018, remote sensing 
data showed that tree-covered areas correspond to about 29% of 
the total area burned by wildfires, most in Africa. Prescribed fires are 
also applied routinely in forests worldwide for fuel reduction and Box 7.2 (continued)
Case description
The 2015 annual mitigation effect of EU-28 forests via contributions to the forest sink, material substitution and energy substitution is 
estimated at 569 MtCO 2 yr–1, or 13% of total current EU emissions. With the right set of incentives in place at EU and member states 
levels, it was found that the EU-28 has the potential to achieve an additional combined mitigation impact through the implementation 
of CSF of 441 MtCO 2 yr–1 by 2050. Also, with the Green Deal and its biodiversity and forest strategy, more emphasis will be placed on 
forests, forest management and the provision of renewables. It is the diversity of measures (from strict reserves to more intensively 
managed systems while adapting the resource) that will determine the success. Only with co-benefits in, for example, nature 
conservation, soil protection, and provision of renewables, wood for buildings and income, the mitigation and adaptation measures 
will be successful.
Interactions, limitations and lessons
Climate-smart forestry is now taking shape across Europe with various research and implementation projects (Climate Smart Forest 
and Nature Management, 2021). Pilots and projects are being implemented by a variety of forest owners, some with more attention 
on biodiversity and adaptation, some with more attention on production functions. They establish examples and in longer term the 
outreach to the 16 million private owners in Europe. However, the right triggers and incentives are often still lacking. For example, 
adapting the spruce forest areas in Central Europe to climate change requires knowledge about different species, biodiversity and 
different management options and eventually use in industry. It requires alternative species to be available from the nurseries, as well 
as improved monitoring to assess the success and steer activities.
increasingly managed in Southwestern USA forest landscapes, which 
have experienced droughts and widespread, high-severity wildfires 
(Keeley et al. 2019). In these forests, fire exclusion management, 
coupled with a  warming climate, has led to increasingly severe 
wildfires (Hurteau et al. 2014). However, the impacts of prescribed 
fires in forests in reducing carbon emissions are still inconclusive. 
Some positive impacts of prescribed fires are associated with other 
fuel reduction techniques (Loudermilk et al. 2017; Flanagan et al. 
2019; Stephens et al. 2020), leading to maintaining carbon stocks and 
reducing carbon emissions in the future where extreme fire weather 
events are more frequent (Krofcheck et al. 2018, 2019; Hurteau 
et al. 2019; Bowman et al. 2020a,b; Goodwin et al. 2020). Land 
management approaches will certainly need to consider the new 
climatic conditions (e.g., the proportion of days in fire seasons with 
the potential for unmanageable fires more than doubling in some 
regions in northern and eastern boreal forest) (Wotton et al. 2017).
Critical assessment and conclusion. There is low confidence 
that the global technical mitigation potential for grassland and 
savanna fire management by 2050 is 0.1 (0.09–0.1) GtCO 2 yr–1, 
and the economic mitigation potential (<USD100 tCO 2–1) is 0.05 
(0.03–0.07) GtCO 2 yr–1. Savanna fires produce significant emissions 
globally, but prescribed fires in the early dry season could mitigate 
emissions in different regions, particularly Africa. Evidence is less 
clear for fire management of forests, with the contribution of 
GHG mitigation depending on many factors that affect the carbon 
balance (e.g.,  Simmonds et al. 2021). Although prescribed burning 
is promoted to reduce uncontrolled wildfires in forests, the benefits 
for the management of carbon stocks are unclear, with different 
studies reporting varying results especially concerning its long-term 
effectiveness (Wotton et al. 2017; Bowman et al. 2020b). Under 
increasing climate change however, an increased attention on fire 
management will be necessary.
7.4.2.5 Reduce Degradation and Conversion 
of Grasslands and Savannas
Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities 
and barriers. Grasslands cover approximately 40.5% of the 
terrestrial area (i.e., 52.5 million km2) divided as 13.8% woody 
savanna and savanna; 12.7% open and closed shrub; 8.3% non-
woody grassland; and 5.7% is tundra (White et al. 2000). Sub-
Saharan Africa and Asia have the most extensive total area, 14.5 
and 8.9 million km2, respectively. A review by Conant et al. (2017) 
reported based on data on grassland area (FAO 2013) and grassland 
soil carbon stocks (Sombroek et al. 1993) a global estimate of about 

worldwide (FAO 2007). Reducing the conversion of grasslands and 
savannas to croplands prevents soil carbon losses by oxidation, and 
to a smaller extent, biomass carbon loss due to vegetation clearing 
(SRCCL, Chapter  6). Restoration of grasslands through enhanced 
soil carbon sequestration, including (i) management of vegetation, 
(ii) animal management, and (iii) fire management, was also 
included in the SRCCL and is covered in Section 7.4.3.1. Similar to 
other measures that reduce conversion, conserving carbon stocks in 
grasslands and savannas can be achieved by controlling conversion drivers (e.g., commercial and subsistence agriculture, see Section 7.3) 
and improving policies and management. In addition to mitigation, 
conserving grasslands provide various socio-economic, biodiversity, 
water cycle and other environmental benefits (Claassen et al. 2010; 
Ryals et al. 2015; Bengtsson et al. 2019). Annual operating costs, and 
opportunity costs of income foregone by undertaking the activities 
needed for avoiding conversion of grasslands making costs one of 
the key barriers for implementation (Lipper et al. 2010).
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC 
and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. The 
SRCCL reported a  mitigation potential for reduced conversion of 
grasslands and savannas of 0.03–0.12 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 (Griscom et al. 
2017; IPCC 2019) considering the higher loss of soil organic carbon in 
croplands (Sanderman et al. 2017). Assuming an average starting soil 
organic carbon stock of temperate grasslands (Poeplau et al. 2011), 
and the mean annual global cropland conversion rates (1961–2003) 
(Krause et al. 2017), the equivalent loss of soil organic carbon 
over 20 years would be 14 GtCO 2-eq, for example, 0.7 GtCO 2 yr–1 
(SRCCL, Chapter 6). IPCC AR5 and AR4 did not explicitly consider the 
mitigation potential of avoided conversion of grasslands-savannas 
but the management of grazing land is accounted for considering 
plant, animal, and fire management with a mean mitigation potential 
of 0.11–0.80 tCO 2-eq ha–1 yr–1 depending on the climate region. This 
resulted in 0.25 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 at USD20 tCO 2–1 to 1.25 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 
at USD100 tCO 2–1 by 2030.
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, 
SROCC and SRCCL). Unlike most of the measures covered in 
Section 7.4, there are currently no global, spatially explicit mitigation 
potential estimates for reduced grassland conversion to generate 
technical and economic potentials by region. Literature developments 
since AR5 and SRCCL are studies that provide mitigation estimates 
in one or a  few countries or regions. Modelling experiments 
comparing Californian forests and grasslands found that grasslands 
resulted in a more resilient carbon sink than forests to future climate 
change (Dass et al. 2018). However, previous studies indicated 
that precipitation is a key controller of the carbon storage in these 
grasslands, with the grassland became a carbon sink in 2005, when 
the region received relatively high spring precipitation (Ma et al. 
2007). In North America, grassland conversion was the source for 
77% of all new croplands from 2008–2012 (Lark et al. 2015). Avoided 
conversion of North American grasslands to croplands presents an 
economic mitigation potential of 0.024 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 and technical 
potential of 0.107 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 (Fargione et al. 2018). This potential 
is related mainly to root biomass and soils (81% of emissions from 
soils). Estimates of GHG emissions from any future deforestation in 
Australian savannas also point to the potential mitigation of around 
0.024 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 (Bristow et al. 2016). The expansion of the 
Soy Moratorium (SoyM) from the Brazilian Amazon to the Cerrado 
(Brazilian savannas) would prevent the direct conversion of 3.6 Mha 
of native vegetation to soybeans by 2050 and avoid the emission of 
0.02 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 (Soterroni et al. 2019).
Critical assessment and conclusion. There is low confidence that 
the global technical mitigation potential for reduced grassland and 
savanna conversion by 2050 is 0.2 (0.1–0.4) GtCO 2 yr–1, and the 
Most of the carbon sequestration potential is in below-ground 
biomass and soil organic matter. However, estimates of potential 
are still based on few studies and vary according to the levels of 
soil carbon, and ecosystem productivity (e.g., in response to rainfall 
distribution). Conservation of grasslands presents significant benefits 
for desertification control, especially in arid areas (SRCCL, Chapter 3). 
Policies supporting avoided conversion can help protect at-risk 
grasslands, reduce GHG emissions, and produce positive outcomes 
for biodiversity and landowners (Ahlering et al. 2016). In comparison 
to tropical rainforest regions that have been the primary target for 
mitigation policies associated to natural ecosystems (e.g., REDD+), 
conversion grasslands and savannas has received less national and 
international attention, despite growing evidence of concentrated 
cropland expansion into these areas with impacts of carbon losses.
7.4.2.6 Reduce Degradation and Conversion 
of Peatlands Activities, Co-benefits, Risks 
and Implementation Barriers
Peatlands are carbon-rich wetland ecosystems with organic soil 
horizons in which soil organic matter concentration exceeds 30% 
(dry weight) and soil carbon concentrations can exceed 50% 
(Page and Baird 2016, Boone Kauffman et al. 2017). Reducing the 
conversion of peatlands avoids emissions of above- and below-
ground biomass and soil carbon due to vegetation clearing, fires, 
and peat decomposition from drainage. Similar to deforestation, 
peatland carbon stocks can be conserved by controlling the drivers 
of conversion and degradation (e.g.,  commercial and subsistence 
agriculture, mining, urban expansion) and improving governance 
and management. Reducing conversion is urgent because peatland 
carbon stocks accumulate slowly and persist over millennia; loss of 
existing stocks cannot be easily reversed over the decadal time scales 
needed to meet the Paris Agreement (Goldstein et al. 2020). The main 
co-benefits of reducing conversion of peatlands include conservation 
of a unique biodiversity including many critically endangered species, 
provision of water quality and regulation, and improved public health 
through decreased fire-caused pollutants (Griscom et al. 2017). 
Although reducing peatland conversion will reduce land availability 
for alternative uses including agriculture or other land-based 
mitigation, drained peatlands constitute a small share of agricultural 
land globally while contributing significant emissions (Joosten 2009). 
Mitigation through reduced conversion of peatlands therefore has 
a high potential of avoided emissions per hectare (Roe et al. 2019).
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC 
and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. In 
the SRCCL (Chapters 2 and 6), it was estimated that avoided peat 
impacts could deliver 0.45–1.22 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 technical potential 
by 2030–2050 (medium confidence) (Hooijer et al. 2010; Griscom 
et al. 2017; Hawken 2017). The mitigation potential estimates cover 
tropical peatlands and include CO 2, N2O and CH 4 emissions. The 
mitigation potential is derived from quantification of losses of carbon 
stocks due to land conversion, shifts in GHG fluxes, alterations in 
net ecosystem productivity, input factors such as fertilisation needs, 
and biophysical climate impacts (e.g., shifts in albedo, water cycles, 
etc.). Tropical peatlands account for only about 10% of peatland area and about 20% of peatland carbon stock but about 80% of peatland 
carbon emissions, primarily from peatland conversion in Indonesia 
(about 60%) and Malaysia (about 10%) (Hooijer et al. 2010; Page 
et al. 2011; Leifeld and Menichetti 2018). While the total mitigation 
potential of peatland conservation is considered moderate, the 
per hectare mitigation potential is the highest among land-based 
mitigation measures (Roe et al. 2019).
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, 
SROCC and SRCCL). Recent studies continue to report high 
carbon stocks in peatlands and emphasise the vulnerability 
of peatland carbon after conversion. The carbon stocks of 
tropical peatlands are among the highest of any forest, 
1,211–4,257 tCO 2-eq ha–1 in the Peruvian Amazon (Bhomia 
et al. 2019) and 1,956–14,757 tCO 2-eq ha–1 in Indonesia (Novita 
et al. 2021). Ninety percent of tropical peatland carbon stocks 
are vulnerable to emission during conversion and may not be 
recoverable through restoration; in contrast, boreal and temperate 
peatlands hold similar carbon stocks  (1,439–5,619 tCO 2-eq ha–1) 
but only 30% of northern carbon stocks are vulnerable to emission 
during conversion and irrecoverable through restoration (Goldstein 
et al. 2020). A  recent study shows global mitigation potential of 
about 0.2 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 at costs up to USD100 tCO 2–1 (Roe et al. 
2021). Another study estimated that 72% of mitigation is achieved 
through avoided soil carbon impacts, with the remainder through 
avoided impacts to vegetation (Bossio et al. 2020). Recent model 
projections show that both peatland protection and peatland 
restoration (Section 7.4.2.7) are needed to achieve a 2°C mitigation 
pathway and that peatland protection and restoration policies 
will have minimal impacts on regional food security (Leifeld et al. 
2019, Humpenöder et al. 2020). Global studies have not accounted 
for extensive peatlands recently reported in the Congo Basin, 
estimated to cover 145,500 km2 and contain 30.6 PgC, as much as 
29% of total tropical peat carbon stock (Dargie et al. 2017). These 
Congo peatlands are relatively intact; continued preservation is 
needed to prevent major emissions (Dargie et al. 2019). In northern 
peatlands that are underlain by permafrost roughly 50% of the 
total peatlands north of 23° latitude, (Hugelius et al. 2020), climate 
change (i.e., warming) is the major driver of peatland degradation 
(e.g., through permafrost thaw) (Schuur et al. 2015, Goldstein et al. 
2020). However, in non-permafrost boreal and temperate peatlands, 
reduction of peatland conversion is also a cost-effective mitigation 
strategy. Peatlands are sensitive to climate change and there is 
low confidence about the future peatland sink globally (SRCCL, 
Chapter  2). Permafrost thaw may shift northern peatlands from 
a net carbon sink to net source (Hugelius et al. 2020). Uncertainties 
in peatland extent and the magnitude of existing carbon stocks, in 
both northern (Loisel et al. 2014) and tropical (Dargie et al. 2017) 
latitudes limit understanding of current and future peatland carbon 
dynamics (Minasny et al. 2019).
Critical assessment and conclusion. Based on studies to date, 
there is medium confidence that peatland conservation has 
a  technical potential of 0.86 (0.43–2.02) GtCO 2-eq yr–1 of which 
0.48  (0.2–0.68) GtCO 2-eq yr–1 is available at USD100 tCO 2–1 
(Figure 7.11). High per hectare mitigation potential and high rate of 
co-benefits particularly in tropical countries, support the effectiveness 
peatland conversion may depend on countries’ governance, financial 
capacity and political will.
7.4.2.7 Peatland Restoration
Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation barriers. 
Peatland restoration involves restoring degraded and damaged 
peatlands, for example through rewetting and revegetation, which 
both increases carbon accumulation in vegetation and soils and 
avoids ongoing CO 2 emissions. Peatlands only account for about 
3% of the terrestrial surface, predominantly occurring in boreal 
ecosystems (78%), with a  smaller proportion in tropical regions 
(13%), but may store about 600 GtC or 21% of the global total soil 
organic carbon stock of about 3000 Gt (Page et al. 2011; Leifeld 
and Menichetti 2018). Peatland restoration delivers co-benefits 
for biodiversity, as well as regulating water flow and preventing 
downstream flooding, while still allowing for extensive management 
such as paludiculture (Tan et al. 2021). Rewetting of peatlands also 
reduces the risk of fire, but may also mobilise salts and contaminants 
in soils (van Diggelen et al. 2020) and in severely degraded peatlands, 
restoration of peatland hydrology and vegetation may not be feasible 
(Andersen et al. 2017). At a  local level, restoration of peatlands 
drained for agriculture could displace food production and damage 
local food supply, although impacts to regional and global food 
security would be minimal (Humpenöder et al. 2020). Collaborative 
and transparent planning processes are needed to reduce conflict 
between competing land uses (Tanneberger et al. 2020b). Adequate 
resources for implementing restoration policies are key to engage 
local communities and maintain livelihoods (Resosudarmo et al. 
2019; Ward et al. 2021).
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC 
and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. Large 
areas (0.51 Mkm2) of global peatlands are degraded of which 
0.2 Mkm2 are tropical peatlands (Griscom et al. 2017; Leifeld and 
Menichetti 2018). According the SRCCL, peatland restoration could 
deliver technical mitigation potentials of 0.15 – 0.81GtCO 2-eq yr–1 
by 2030–2050 (low confidence) (Couwenberg et al. 2010; Griscom 
et al. 2017) (Chapters 2 and 6 of the SRCCL), though there could be 
an increase in methane emissions after restoration (Jauhiainen et al. 
2008). The mitigation potential estimates cover global peatlands and 
include CO 2, N2O and CH 4 emissions. Peatlands are highly sensitive 
to climate change (high confidence), however there are currently no 
studies that estimate future climate effects on mitigation potential 
from peatland restoration.
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, 
SROCC and SRCCL). The most recent literature and reviews indicate 
with high confidence that restoration would decrease CO 2 emissions 
and with medium confidence that restoration would decrease net 
GHG emissions from degraded peatlands (Wilson et al. 2016; Ojanen 
and Minkkinen 2020; van Diggelen et al. 2020). Although rewetting 
of drained peatlands increases CH 4 emissions, this effect is often 
outweighed by decreases in CO 2 and N 2O emissions but depends 
very much on local circumstances (Günther et al. 2020). Restoration 
and rewetting of almost all drained peatlands is needed by 2050 to meet 1.5°C–2°C pathways which is unlikely to happen (Leifeld et al. 
2019); immediate rewetting and restoration minimises the warming 
from cumulative CO 2 emissions (Nugent et al. 2019).
According to recent data, the technical mitigation potential for global 
peatland restoration is estimated at 0.5–1.3 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 (Leifeld 
and Menichetti 2018; Griscom et al. 2020; Bossio et al. 2020; Roe et al. 
2021) (Figure  7.11), with 80% of the mitigation potential derived 
from improvements to soil carbon (Bossio et al. 2020). The regional 
mitigation potentials of all peatlands outlined in Roe et al. (2021) 
reflect the country-level estimates from (Humpenöder et al. 2020).
Climate mitigation effects of peatland rewetting depend on the 
climate zone and land use. Recent analysis shows the strongest 
mitigation gains from rewetting drained temperate and boreal 
peatlands used for agriculture and drained tropical peatlands (Ojanen 
and Minkkinen 2020). However, estimates of emission factors from 
rewetting drained tropical peatlands remain uncertain (Wilson et al. 
2016; Murdiyarso et al. 2019). Topsoil removal, in combination with 
rewetting, may improve restoration success and limit CH 4 emissions 
during restoration of highly degraded temperate peatlands (Zak et al. 
2018). In temperate and boreal regions, co-benefits mentioned above 
are major motivations for peatland restoration (Chimner et al. 2017; 
Tanneberger et al. 2020a).
Critical assessment and conclusion. Based on studies to date, 
there is medium confidence that peatland restoration has a technical 
potential of 0.79 (0.49–1.3) GtCO 2-eq yr–1 (median) of which 
0.4 (0.2–0.6) GtCO 2-eq yr–1 is available up to USD100 tCO 2–1. The large 
land area of degraded peatlands suggests that significant emissions 
reductions could occur through large-scale restoration especially 
in tropical peatlands. There is medium confidence in the large 
carbon stocks of tropical peat forests (1956–14,757 tCO 2-eq ha–1) 
and large rates of carbon loss associated with land cover change 
(640–1650 tCO 2-eq ha–1) (Goldstein et al. 2020; Novita et al. 
2021). However, large-scale implementation of tropical peatland 
restoration will likely be limited by costs and other demands for these 
tropical lands.
7.4.2.8 Reduce Conversion of Coastal Wetlands
Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation barriers.  
Reducing conversion of coastal wetlands, including mangroves, 
marshes and seagrass ecosystems, avoids emissions from above and 
below ground biomass and soil carbon through avoided degradation 
and/or loss. Coastal wetlands occur mainly in estuaries and deltas, 
areas that are often densely settled, with livelihoods closely linked 
to coastal ecosystems and resources (Moser et al. 2012). The 
carbon stocks of these highly productive ecosystems are sometimes 
referred to as ‘blue carbon’. Loss of existing stocks cannot be easily 
reversed over decadal time scales (Goldstein et al. 2020). The main 
drivers of conversion include intensive aquaculture, agriculture, salt 
ponds, urbanisation and infrastructure development, the extensive 
use of fertilisers, and extraction of water resources (Lovelock 
et al. 2018). Reduced conversion of coastal wetlands has many co-
benefits, including biodiversity conservation, fisheries production, 
soil stabilisation, water flow and water quality regulation, flooding 
(Windham-Myers et al. 2018a; UNEP 2020). Risks associated with 
the mitigation potential of coastal wetland conservation include 
uncertain permanence under future climate scenarios, including 
the effects of coastal squeeze, where coastal wetland area may be 
lost if upland area is not available for migration as sea levels rise 
(Lovelock and Reef 2020) (AR6 WGII, Section 3.4.2.5). Preservation 
of coastal wetlands also conflicts with other land use in the coastal 
zone, including aquaculture, agriculture, and human development; 
economic incentives are needed to prioritise wetland preservation 
over more profitable short-term land use. Integration of policies 
and efforts aimed at coastal climate mitigation, adaptation, 
biodiversity conservation, and fisheries, for example through 
integrated coastal zone management and marine spatial planning, 
will bundle climate mitigation with co-benefits and optimise 
outcomes (Herr et al. 2017).
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, 
SROCC and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. 
Coastal wetlands contain high, yet variable, organic carbon stocks, 
leading to a range of estimates of the global mitigation potential of 
reduced conversion. The SRCCL (Chapter 2) and SROCC (Chapter 5), 
report a technical mitigation potential of 0.15–5.35 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 
by 2050 (Pendleton et al. 2012; Lovelock et al. 2017; Howard et al. 
2017; Griscom et al. 2017). The mitigation potential is derived from 
quantification of losses of carbon stocks in vegetation and soil 
due to land conversion, shifts in GHG fluxes associated with land 
use, and alterations in net ecosystem productivity. The wide range 
in estimates mostly relate to the scope (all coastal ecosystems vs 
mangroves only) and different assumptions on decomposition rates. 
Loss rates of coastal wetlands have been estimated at 0.2–3% yr–1, 
depending on the vegetation type and location (Atwood et al. 2017; 
Howard et al. 2017).
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, 
SROCC and SRCCL). Global technical mitigation potential for 
conservation of coastal wetlands from recent literature have 
focused on protection of mangroves; estimates range from 
0.06–2.25 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 (Griscom et al. 2020; Bossio et al. 2020) 
with 80% of the mitigation potential derived from improvements to 
soil carbon (Bossio et al. 2020). Regional potentials (Roe et al. 2021) 
reflect mangrove protection; marsh and seagrass protection were not 
included due to lack of country-level data on marsh and seagrass 
distribution and conversion.
Global estimates show mangroves have the largest per hectare carbon 
stocks (see IPCC AR6 WGII Box 3.4 for estimates of carbon stocks, 
burial rates and ecosystem extent for coastal wetland ecosystems). 
Mean ecosystem carbon stock in mangroves is 3131 tCO 2-eq ha–1 
among the largest carbon stocks on Earth. Recent studies emphasise 
the variability in total ecosystem carbon stocks for each wetland type, 
based on species and climatic and edaphic conditions (Kauffman 
et al. 2020; Bedulli et al. 2020; Ricart et al. 2020; Alongi et al. 2020; 
F . Wang et al. 2021), and highlight the vulnerability of soil carbon 
below 1 m depth (Arifanti et al. 2019). Sea level strongly influences 
coastal wetland distribution, productivity, and sediment accretion; 
therefore, sea level rise will impact carbon accumulation and persistence of existing carbon stocks (Macreadie et al. 2019) (IPCC 
AR6 WGII Box 3.4).
Recent loss rates of mangroves are 0.16–0.39% yr–1 and are highest 
in South-East Asia (Hamilton and Casey 2016; Friess et al. 2019; 
Hamilton and Casey 2016). Assuming loss of soil carbon to 1 m depth 
after deforestation, avoiding mangrove conversion has the technical 
potential to mitigate approximately 23.5–38.7 MtCO 2-eq yr–1 
(Ouyang and Lee 2020); note, this potential is additional to reduced 
conversion of forests (Griscom et al. 2020) (Section  7.4.2.1). 
Regional estimates show that about 85% of mitigation potential 
for avoided mangrove conversion is in South-East Asia and Pacific 
(32 MtCO 2-eq yr–1 at USD100 tCO 2–1), 10% is in Latin American and 
the Caribbean (4 MtCO 2-eq yr–1), and approximately 5% in other 
regions (Griscom et al. 2020; Roe et al. 2021).
Key uncertainties remain in mapping extent and conversion rates 
for salt marshes and seagrasses (McKenzie et al. 2020). Seagrass 
loss rates were estimated at 1–2% yr–1 (Dunic et al. 2021) with 
stabilisation in some regions (de los Santos et al. 2019) (AR6 WGII, 
Section 3.4.2.5); however, loss occurs non-linearly and depends on 
site-specific context. Tidal marsh extent and conversion rates remains 
poorly estimated, outside of the USA, Europe, South Africa, and 
Australia (Mcowen et al. 2017; Macreadie et al. 2019).
Critical assessment and conclusion. There is medium confidence 
that coastal wetland protection has a  technical potential of 
0.8 (0.06–5.4) GtCO 2-eq yr–1 of which 0.17 (0.06–0.27) GtCO 2-eq yr–1 
is available up to USD100 tCO 2–1. There is a  high certainty (robust 
evidence, high agreement) that coastal ecosystems have among the 
largest carbon stocks of any ecosystem. As these ecosystems provide 
many important services, reduced conversion of coastal wetlands is 
a valuable mitigation strategy with numerous co-benefits. However,  
the vulnerability of coastal wetlands to climatic and other anthropogenic 
stressors may limit the permanence of climate mitigation.
7.4.2.9 Coastal Wetland Restoration
Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation barriers.  
Coastal wetland restoration involves restoring degraded or damaged 
coastal  wetlands including mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass 
ecosystems, leading to sequestration of ‘blue carbon’ in wetland 
vegetation and soil (SRCCL, Chapter 6; SROCC, Chapter 5). Successful 
approaches to wetland restoration include: (i) passive restoration, 
the removal of anthropogenic activities that are causing degradation 
or preventing recovery; and (ii) active restoration, purposeful 
manipulations to the environment in order to achieve recovery to 
a  naturally functioning system (Elliott et al. 2016) (IPCC AR6 WGII 
Chapter  3). Restoration of coastal wetlands delivers many valuable 
co-benefits, including enhanced water quality, biodiversity, aesthetic 
values, fisheries production (food security), and protection from rising 
sea levels and storm impacts (Barbier et al. 2011; Hochard et al. 2019; 
Sun and Carson 2020; Duarte et al. 2020). Of the 0.3 Mkm2 coastal 
wetlands globally, 0.11 Mkm2 of mangroves are considered feasible 
for restoration (Griscom et al. 2017). Risks associated with coastal 
wetland restoration include uncertain permanence under future 
climate scenarios (IPCC AR6 WGII, Box 3.4), partial offsets of mitigation 
formation, and competition with other land uses, including aquaculture 
and human settlement and development in the coastal zone (SROCC, 
Chapter 5). To date, many coastal wetland restoration efforts do not 
succeed due to failure to address the drivers of degradation (van 
Katwijk et al. 2016). However, improved frameworks for implementing 
and assessing coastal wetland restoration are emerging that emphasise 
the recovery of ecosystem functions (Zhao et al. 2016; Cadier et al. 
2020). Restoration projects that involve local communities at all stages 
and consider both biophysical and socio-political context are more 
likely to succeed (Brown et al. 2014; Wylie et al. 2016).
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, 
SROCC and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. 
The SRCCL reported that mangrove restoration has the technical 
potential to mitigate 0.07 GtCO 2 yr–1 through rewetting (Crooks et al. 
2011) and take up 0.02–0.84 GtCO 2 yr–1 from vegetation biomass 
and soil enhancement through 2030 (medium confidence) (Griscom 
et al. 2017). The SROCC concluded that cost-effective coastal blue 
carbon restoration had a potential of about 0.15–0.18 GtCO 2-eq yr–1, 
a  low global potential compared to other ocean-based solutions 
but with extensive co-benefits and limited adverse side effects 
(Gattuso et al. 2018).
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, 
SROCC and SRCCL). Recent studies emphasise the time frame needed 
to achieve the full mitigation potential (Duarte et al. 2020; Taillardat 
et al. 2020). The first project-derived estimate of the net GHG benefit 
from seagrass restoration found 1.54 tCO 2-eq (0.42 MgC) ha–1 yr–1 

to the default emission factor in the Wetlands Supplement (Kennedy 
et al. 2014). Recent studies of rehabilitated mangroves also indicate 
that annual carbon sequestration rates in biomass and soils can 
return to natural levels within decades of restoration (Cameron et al. 
2019; Sidik et al. 2019). A  meta-analysis shows increasing carbon 
sequestration rates over the first 15 years of mangrove restoration 
with rates stabilising at 25.7 ± 7.7 tCO 2-eq (7.0 ± 2.1 MgC) ha–1 yr–1 
through forty years, although success depends on climate, sediment 
type, and restoration methods (Sasmito et al. 2019). Overall, 30% of 
mangrove soil carbon stocks and 50–70% of marsh and seagrass 
carbon stocks are unlikely to recover within 30 years of restoration, 
underscoring the importance of preventing conversion of coastal 
wetlands (Goldstein et al. 2020) (Section 7.4.2.8).
According to recent data, the technical mitigation potential for global 
coastal wetland restoration is 0.04–0.84 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 (Griscom et al. 
2020; Bossio et al. 2020; Roe et al. 2021) with 60% of the mitigation 
potential derived from improvements to soil carbon (Bossio et al. 
2020). Regional potentials based on country-level estimates from 
Griscom et al. (2020) show the technical and economic (up to 
USD100 tCO 2–1) potential of mangrove restoration; seagrass and 
marsh restoration was not included due to lack of country-level data 
on distribution and conversion (but see McKenzie et al. 2020 for 
updates on global seagrass distribution). Although global potential is 
relatively moderate, mitigation can be quite significant for countries 
with extensive coastlines (e.g., Indonesia, Brazil) and for small island 
states where coastal wetlands have been shown to comprise 24–34% of their total national carbon stock (Donato et al. 2012). Furthermore, 
non-climatic co-benefits can strongly motivate coastal wetland 
restoration worldwide (UNEP 2021a). Major successes in both active 
and passive restoration of seagrasses have been documented in 
North America and Europe (Lefcheck et al. 2018; de los Santos et al. 
2019; Orth et al. 2020); passive restoration may also be feasible for 
mangroves (Cameron et al. 2019).
There is high site-specific variation in carbon sequestration rates 
and uncertainties regarding the response to future climate change 
(Jennerjahn et al. 2017; Nowicki et al. 2017) (IPCC AR6 WGII Box 3.4). 
Changes in distributions (Kelleway et al. 2017; Wilson and Lotze 2019), 
methane release (Al-Haj and Fulweiler 2020), carbonate formation 
(Saderne et al. 2019), and ecosystem responses to interactive climate 
stressors are not well-understood (Short et al. 2016; Fitzgerald and 
Hughes 2019; Lovelock and Reef 2020).
Critical assessment and conclusion. There is medium confidence 
that coastal wetland restoration has a  technical potential of 
0.3 (0.04–0.84) GtCO 2-eq yr–1 of which 0.1 (0.05–0.2) GtCO 2-eq yr–1 
is available up to USD100 tCO 2–1. There is high confidence that 
coastal wetlands, especially mangroves, contain large carbon stocks 
relative to other ecosystems and medium confidence that restoration 
will reinstate pre-disturbance carbon sequestration rates. There is low 
confidence on the response of coastal wetlands to climate change; 
however, there is high confidence that coastal wetland restoration 
will provide a suite of valuable co-benefits.
7.4.3 Agriculture
7.4.3.1 Soil Carbon Management in Croplands and Grasslands
Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities 
and barriers. Increasing soil organic matter in croplands are 
agricultural management practices that include (i) crop management: 
for example, high input carbon practices such as improved crop 
varieties, crop rotation, use of cover crops, perennial cropping systems 
(including agroforestry; see Section  7.4.3.3), integrated production 
systems, crop diversification, agricultural biotechnology; (ii) nutrient 
management including fertilisation with organic amendments/green 
manures (Section 7.4.3.6); (iii) reduced tillage intensity and residue 
retention, (iv) improved water management: including drainage of 
waterlogged mineral soils and irrigation of crops in arid/semi-arid 
conditions, (v) improved rice management (Section  7.4.3.5) and 
(vi) biochar application (P .  Smith et al. 2019a) (Section  7.4.3.2). 
For increased soil organic matter in grasslands, practices include 
(i) management of vegetation: including improved grass varieties/
sward composition, deep rooting grasses, increased productivity, 
and nutrient management, (ii) livestock management: including 
appropriate stocking densities fit to carrying capacity, fodder banks, 
and fodder diversification, and (iii) fire management: improved use of 
fire for sustainable grassland management, including fire prevention 
and improved prescribed burning (Smith et al. 2014, 2019b). All these 
measures are recognised as Sustainable Soil Management Practices 
by FAO (Baritz et al. 2018). While there are co-benefits for livelihoods, 
biodiversity, water provision and food security (P . Smith et al. 2019a), 
sequestration do not apply (since production in not displaced), the 
climate benefits of soil carbon sequestration in croplands can be 
negated if achieved through additional fertiliser inputs (potentially 
causing increased N 2O emissions; (Guenet et al. 2021), and both 
saturation and permanence are relevant concerns. When considering 
implementation barriers, soil carbon management in croplands and 
grasslands is a low-cost option at a high level of technology readiness 
(it is already widely deployed globally) with low socio-cultural and 
institutional barriers, but with difficulty in monitoring and verification 
proving a barrier to implementation (Smith et al. 2020a).
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC 
and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. Building 
on AR5, the SRCCL reported the global mitigation potential for soil 
carbon management in croplands to be 1.4–2.3 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 (Smith 
et al. 2014), though the full literature range was 0.3–6.8 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 
(Sommer and Bossio 2014; Powlson et al. 2014; Dickie et al. 2014b; 
Henderson et al. 2015; Herrero et al. 2016; Paustian et al. 2016; 
Zomer et al. 2016; Frank et al. 2017; Conant et al. 2017; Griscom et al. 
2017; Hawken 2017; Sanderman et al. 2017; Fuss et al. 2018; Roe 
et al. 2019). The global mitigation potential for soil organic carbon 
management in grasslands was assessed to be 1.4–1.8 GtCO 2-eq yr–1, 
with the full literature range being 0.1–2.6 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 (Herrero 
et al. 2013; 2016; Conant et al. 2017; Roe et al. 2019). Lower values 
in the range represented economic potentials, while higher values 
represented technical potentials – and uncertainty was expressed by 
reporting the whole range of estimates. The SR1.5 outlined associated 
costs reported in literature to range from USD –45 to 100 tCO 2–1, 
describing enhanced soil carbon sequestration as a  cost-effective 
measure (IPCC 2018). Despite significant mitigation potential, there 
is limited inclusion of soil carbon sequestration as a response option 
within IAM mitigation pathways (Rogelj et al. 2018a).
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, 
SROCC and SRCCL). No recent literature has been published which 
conflict with the mitigation potentials reported in the SRCCL. Relevant 
papers include Lal et al. (2018) which estimated soil carbon 
sequestration potential to be 0.7–4.1 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 for croplands 
and 1.1–2.9 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 for grasslands. Bossio et al. (2020) 
assessed the contribution of soil carbon sequestration to natural 
climate solutions and found the potential to be 5.5 GtCO 2 yr–1 across 
all ecosystems, with only small portions of this (0.41 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 
for cover cropping in croplands; 0.23, 0.15, 0.15 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 for 
avoided grassland conversion, optimal grazing intensity and legumes 
in pastures, respectively) arising from croplands and grasslands. 
Regionally, soil carbon management in croplands is feasible 
anywhere, but effectiveness can be limited in very dry regions 
(Sanderman et al. 2017). For soil carbon management in grasslands 
the feasibility is greatest in areas where grasslands have been 
degraded (e.g., by overgrazing) and soil organic carbon is depleted. 
For well managed grasslands, soil carbon stocks are already high and 
the potential for additional carbon storage is low. Roe et al. (2021) 
estimate the greatest economic (up to USD100 tCO 2–1) potential 
between 2020 and 2050 for croplands to be in Asia and the Pacific 
(339.7 MtCO 2 yr–1) and for grasslands, in Developed Countries 
(253.6 MtCO 2 yr–1).Critical assessment and conclusion. In conclusion, there is medium 
confidence that enhanced soil carbon management in croplands has 
a global technical mitigation potential of 1.9 (0.4–6.8) GtCO 2 yr–1, 
and in grasslands of 1.0 (0.2–2.6) GtCO 2 yr–1, of which, 0.6 (04–0.9) 
and 0.9 (0.3–1.6) GtCO 2 yr–1 is estimated to be available at up to 
USD100 tCO 2–1 respectively. Regionally, soil carbon management 
in croplands and grasslands is feasible anywhere, but effectiveness 
can be limited in very dry regions, and for grasslands it is greatest 
in areas where degradation has occurred (e.g.,  by overgrazing) 
and soil organic carbon is depleted. Barriers to implementation 
include regional capacity for monitoring and verification (especially 
in developing countries), and more widely through concerns over 
saturation and permanence.
7.4.3.2 Biochar
Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities 
and barriers. Biochar is produced by heating organic matter in 
oxygen-limited environments (pyrolysis and gasification) (Lehmann 
and Joseph 2012). Feedstocks include forestry and sawmill residues, 
straw, manure and biosolids. When applied to soils, biochar is 
estimated to persist from decades to thousands of years, depending 
on feedstock and production conditions (J. Wang et al. 2016; Singh 
et al. 2015). Biochar systems producing biochar for soil application 
plus bioenergy, generally give greater mitigation than bioenergy 
alone and other uses of biochar, and are recognised as a  CDR 
strategy. Biochar persistence is increased through interaction with 
clay minerals and soil organic matter (Fang et al. 2015). Additional 
CDR benefits arise through ‘negative priming’ whereby biochar 
stabilises soil carbon and rhizodeposits (Weng et al. 2015; J. Wang 
et al. 2016; Archanjo et al. 2017; Hagemann et al. 2017; Han Weng 
et al. 2017; Weng et al. 2018). Besides CDR, additional mitigation 
can arise from displacing fossil fuels with pyrolysis gases, lower 
soil N 2O emissions (Cayuela et al. 2014, 2015; Song et al. 2016; He 
et al. 2017; Verhoeven et al. 2017; Borchard et al. 2019), reduced 
nitrogen fertiliser requirements due to reduced nitrogen leaching 
and volatilisation from soils (Liu et al. 2019; Borchard et al. 2019), 
and reduced GHG emissions from compost when biochar is added 
(Agyarko-Mintah et al. 2017; Wu et al. 2017). Biochar application 
to paddy rice has resulted in substantial reductions (20–40% on 
average) in N 2O (Song et al. 2016; Awad et al. 2018; Liu et al. 2018) 
(Section 7.4.3.5) and smaller reduction in CH 4 emissions (Song et al. 
2016; Kammann et al. 2017; Kim et al. 2017a; He et al. 2017; Awad 
et al. 2018). Potential co-benefits include yield increases particularly 
in sandy and acidic soils with low cation exchange capacity (Woolf 
et al. 2016; Jeffery et al. 2017); increased soil water-holding capacity 
(Omondi et al. 2016), nitrogen use efficiency (Liu et al. 2019; Borchard 
et al. 2019), biological nitrogen fixation (Van Zwieten et al. 2015); 
adsorption of organic pollutants and heavy metals (e.g., Silvani et al. 
2019); odour reduction from manure handling (e.g.,  Hwang et al. 
2018) and managing forest fuel loads (Puettmann et al. 2020). Due to 
its dark colour, biochar could decrease soil albedo (Meyer et al. 2012), 
though this is insignificant under recommended rates and application 
methods. Biochar could reduce enteric CH 4 emissions when fed to 
ruminants (Section 7.4.3.4). Barriers to upscaling include insufficient 
investment, limited large-scale production facilities, high production 
costs at small scale, lack of agreed approach to monitoring, reporting 
control, restricting user confidence (Gwenzi et al. 2015).
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC 
and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. Biochar is 
discussed as a mitigation option in AR5 and CDR strategy in the SR1.5. 
Consideration of potential was limited as biochar is not included in IAMs. 
The SRCCL estimated mitigation potential of 0.03–6.6 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 
by 2050 based on studies with widely varying assumptions, definitions 
of potential, and scope of mitigation processes included (SRCCL, 
Chapters 2 and 4: (Roberts et al. 2010; Pratt and Moran 2010; Hristov 
et al. 2013; Lee and Day 2013; Dickie et al. 2014a; Hawken 2017; Fuss 
et al. 2018; Powell and Lenton 2012; Woolf et al. 2010).
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC 
and SRCCL). Developments include mechanistic understanding 
of ‘negative priming’ and biochar-soil-microbes-plant interactions 
(DeCiucies et al. 2018; Fang et al. 2019). Indirect climate benefits are 
associated with persistent yield response to biochar (Kätterer et al. 
2019; Ye et al. 2020), improved crop water use efficiency (Du et al. 
2018; Gao et al. 2020) and reduced GHG and ammonia emissions 
from compost and manure (Sanchez-Monedero et al. 2018; Bora 
et al. 2020a,b; Zhao et al. 2020). A quantification method based on 
biochar properties is included in the IPCC guidelines for NGHGIs 
(Domke et al. 2019). Studies report a range of biochar responses, from 
positive to occasionally adverse impacts, including on GHG emissions, 
and identify risks (Tisserant and Cherubini 2019). This illustrates the 
expected variability (Lehmann and Rillig 2014) of responses, which 
depend on the biochar type and climatic and edaphic characteristics 
of the site (Zygourakis 2017). Biochar properties vary with feedstock, 
production conditions and post-production treatments, so mitigation 
and agronomic benefits are maximised when biochars are chosen to 
suit the application context (Mašek et al. 2018). A recent assessment 
finds greatest economic potential (up to USD100 tCO 2–1) between 

followed by Developed Countries (447 MtCO 2 yr–1) (Roe et al. 2021). 
Mitigation through biochar will be greatest where biochar is applied 
to responsive soils (acidic, low fertility), where soil N 2O emissions 
are high (intensive horticulture, irrigated crops), and where the 
syngas co-product displaces fossil fuels. Due to the early stage of 
commercialisation, mitigation estimates are based pilot-scale facilities, 
leading to uncertainty. However, the long-term persistence of biochar 
carbon in soils has been widely studied (Singh et al. 2012; Fang et al. 
2019; Zimmerman and Ouyang 2019). The greatest uncertainty is the 
availability of sustainably-sourced biomass for biochar production.
Critical assessment and conclusion. Biochar has significant 
mitigation potential through CDR and emissions reduction, and can 
also improve soil properties, enhancing productivity and resilience 
to climate change (medium agreement, robust evidence). There 
is medium evidence that biochar has a  technical potential of 
2.6 (0.2–6.6) GtCO 2-eq yr–1, of which 1.1 (0.3–1.8) GtCO 2-eq yr–1 is 
available up to USD100 tCO 2–1. However, mitigation and agronomic 
co-benefits depend strongly on biochar properties and the soil to 
which biochar is applied (strong agreement, robust evidence). While 
biochar could provide moderate to large mitigation potential, it is not 
yet included in IAMs, which has restricted comparison and integration 
with other CDR strategies.7.4.3.3 Agroforestry
Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities 
and barriers. Agroforestry is a set of diverse land management systems 
that integrate trees and shrubs with crops and/or livestock in space 
and/or time. Agroforestry accumulates carbon in woody vegetation and 
soil (Ramachandran Nair et al. 2010) and offers multiple co-benefits 
such as increased land productivity, diversified livelihoods, reduced 
soil erosion, improved water quality, and more hospitable regional 
climates (Ellison et al. 2017; Kuyah et al. 2019; Mbow et al. 2020; Zhu 
et al. 2020). Incorporation of trees and shrubs in agricultural systems, 
however, can affect food production, biodiversity, local hydrology and 
contribute to social inequality (Amadu et al. 2020; Fleischman et al. 
2020; Holl and Brancalion 2020). To minimise risks and maximise co-
benefits, agroforestry should be implemented as part of support 
systems that deliver tools, and information to increase farmers’ agency. 
This may include reforming policies, strengthening extension systems 
and creating market opportunities that enable adoption (Jamnadass 
et al. 2020; Sendzimir et al. 2011; P . Smith et al. 2019a). Consideration 
of carbon sequestration in the context of food and fuel production, as 
well as environmental co-benefits at the farm, local, and regional scales 
can further help support decisions to plant, regenerate and maintain 
agroforestry systems (Kumar and Nair 2011; Miller et al. 2020). In spite 
of the advantages, biophysical and socio-economic factors can limit the 
adoption (Pattanayak et al. 2003). Contextual factors may include, but 
are not limited to; water availability, soil fertility, seed and germplasm 
access, land policies and tenure systems affecting farmer agency, 
access to credit, and to information regarding the optimum species for 
a given location.
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, 
SROCC and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. 
The SRCCL estimated the global technical mitigation potential of 
agroforestry, with medium confidence, to be between 0.08 and 
5.6 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 by 2050 (Griscom et al. 2017; Dickie et al. 2014a; 
Zomer et al. 2016; Hawken 2017). Estimates are derived from 
syntheses of potential area available for various agroforestry systems, 
for example, windbreaks, farmer managed natural regeneration, and 
alley cropping and average annual rates of carbon accumulation. The 
cost-effective economic potential, also with medium confidence, is 
more limited at 0.3–2.4 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 (Zomer et al. 2016; Griscom 
et al. 2017; Roe et al. 2019). Despite this potential, agroforestry is 
currently not considered in integrated assessment models used for 
mitigation pathways (Section 7.5).
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC 
and SRCCL). Updated estimates of agroforestry’s technical mitigation 
potential and synthesised estimates of carbon sequestration across 
agroforestry systems have since been published. The most recent global 
analysis estimates technical potential of 9.4 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 (Chapman 
et al. 2020) of agroforestry on 1.87 and 1.89 billion ha of crop and 
pasture lands below median carbon content, respectively. This estimate 
is at least 68% greater than the largest estimate reported in the SRCCL 
(Hawken 2017) and represents a  new conservative upper bound as 
Chapman et al. (2020) only accounted for above-ground carbon. 
Considering both above- and below-ground carbon of windbreaks, 
alley cropping and silvopastoral systems at a  more limited areal 
extent (Griscom et al. 2020), the economic potential of agroforestry 
estimates primarily result from assumptions on the agroforestry 
systems including, extent of implementation and estimated carbon 
sequestration potential when converting to agroforestry.
Regional estimates of mitigation potential are scant with agroforestry 
options differing significantly by geography (Feliciano et al. 2018). For 
example, multi-strata shaded coffee and cacao are successful in the 
humid tropics (Somarriba et al. 2013; Blaser et al. 2018), silvopastoral 
systems are prevalent in Latin American (Peters et al. 2013; Landholm 
et al. 2019) while agrosilvopastoral systems, shelterbelts, hedgerows, 
and windbreaks are common in Europe (Joffre et al. 1988; Rigueiro-
Rodriguez 2009). At the field scale, agroforestry accumulates between 
0.59 and 6.24 t ha–1 yr–1 of carbon above-ground. Below-ground 
carbon often constitutes 25% or more of the potential carbon gains 
in agroforestry systems (De Stefano and Jacobson 2018; Cardinael 
et al. 2018). Roe et al. (2021) estimate greatest regional economic 
(up to USD100 tCO 2–1) mitigation potential for the period 2020–2050 
to be in Asia and the Pacific (368.4 MtCO 2-eq yr–1) and Developed 
Countries (264.7 MtCO 2-eq yr–1).
Recent research has also highlighted co-benefits and more precisely 
identified implementation barriers. In addition to aforementioned 
co-benefits, evidence now shows that agroforestry can improve soil health, regarding infiltration and structural stability (Muchane et al. 
2020); reduces ambient temperatures and crop heat stress (Arenas-
Corraliza et al. 2018; Sida et al. 2018); increases groundwater 
recharge in drylands when managed at moderate density (Ilstedt 
et al. 2016; Bargués-Tobella et al. 2020); positively influences human 
health (Rosenstock et al. 2019); and can improve dietary diversity 
(McMullin et al. 2019). Along with previously mentioned barriers, low 
social capital, assets, and labour availability have been identified as 
pertinent to adoption. Practically all barriers are interdependent and 
subject to the context of implementation.
Critical assessment and conclusion. There is medium 
confidence that agroforestry has a  technical potential of 
4.1  (0.3–9.4) GtCO 2-eq yr–1 for the period 2020–2050, of which 
0.8 (0.4–1.1) GtCO 2-eq yr–1 is available at USD100 tCO 2–1. Despite 
uncertainty around global estimates due to regional preferences 
for management systems, suitable land availability, and growing 
conditions, there is high confidence in agroforestry’s mitigation 
potential at the field scale. With countless options for farmers and land 
managers to implement agroforestry, there is medium confidence in 
the feasibility of achieving estimated regional mitigation potential. 
Appropriately matching agroforestry options, to local biophysical 
and social contexts is important in maximising mitigation and co-
benefits, while avoiding risks (Sinclair and Coe 2019).
Box 7.3 | Case Study: Agroforestry in Brazil – CANOPIES
Summary
Brazilian farmers are integrating trees into their croplands in various ways, ranging from simple to highly complex agroforestry 
systems. While complex systems are more effective in the mitigation of climate change, trade-offs with scalability need to be resolved 
for agroforestry systems to deliver on their potential. The Brazilian-Dutch CANOPIES project (Janssen 2020) is exploring transition 
pathways to agroforestry systems optimised for local ecological and socio-economic conditions.
Background
The climate change mitigation potential of agroforestry systems is widely recognised (Zomer et al. 2016; FAO 2017b) and Brazilian 
farmers and researchers are pioneering diverse ways of integrating trees into croplands, from planting rows of eucalyptus trees in 
pastures up to highly complex agroforests consisting of >30 crop and tree species. The degree of complexity influences the multiple 
functions that farmers and societies can attain from agroforestry: the more complex it is, the more it resembles a natural forest with 
associated benefits for its carbon storage capacity and its habitat quality for biodiversity (Santos et al. 2019). However, trade-offs 
exist between the complexity and scalability of agroforestry as complex systems rely on intensive manual labour to achieve high 
productivity (Tscharntke et al. 2011). To date, mechanisation of structurally diverse agroforests is scarce and hence, efficiencies of 
scale are difficult to achieve.
Case description
These synergies and trade-offs between complexity, multifunctionality and scalability are studied in the CANOPIES (Co-existence of 
Agriculture and Nature: Optimisation and Planning of Integrated Ecosystem Services) project, a collaboration between Wageningen 
University (NL), the University of São Paulo and EMBRAPA (both Brazil). Soil and management data are collected on farms of varying 
complexity to evaluate carbon sequestration and other ecosystem services, economic performance and labour demands.
Interactions and limitations
The trade-off between complexity and labour demand is less pronounced in EMBRAPA’s integrated crop-livestock-forestry (ICLF) 
systems, where grains and pasture are planted between widely spaced tree rows. Here, barriers for implementation relate mostly to 
livestock and grain farmers’ lack of knowledge on forestry management and financing mechanisms5 (Gil et al. 2015). Additionally, linking 
these financing mechanisms to carbon sequestration remains a Monitoring, Reporting and Verification challenge (Smith et al. 2020b).
Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities 
and barriers. Mitigating CH 4 emissions from enteric fermentation 
can be direct (i.e., targeting ruminal methanogenesis and emissions 
per animal or unit of feed consumed) or indirect, by increasing 
production efficiency (i.e., reducing emission intensity per unit of 
product). Measures can be classified as those relating to (i) feeding, 
(ii) supplements, additives and vaccines, and (iii) livestock breeding 
and wider husbandry (Jia et al. 2019). Co-benefits include enhanced 
climate change adaptation and increased food security associated 
with improved livestock breeding (Smith et al. 2014). Risks include 
mitigation persistence, ecological impacts associated with improving 
feed quality and supply, or potential toxicity and animal welfare 
issues concerning feed additives. Implementation barriers include 
feeding/administration constraints, the stage of development of 
measures, legal restrictions on emerging technologies and negative 
impacts, such as the previously described risks (Smith et al. 2014; Jia 
et al. 2019; P . Smith et al. 2019a).
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC 
and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. The AR5 
indicated medium (5–15%) technical mitigation potential from both 
feeding and breeding related measures (Smith et al. 2014). More 
recently, the SRCCL estimated with medium confidence, a  global 
potential of 0.12–1.18 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 between 2020 and 2050, with 
the range reflecting technical, economic and sustainability constraints 
(SRCCL, Chapter 2: Hristov et al. 2013; Dickie et al. 2014a; Herrero 
et al. 2016; Griscom et al. 2017). The underlying literature used 
a  mixture of IPCC GWP100 values for CH 4, preventing conversion 
of CO 2-eq to CH 4. Improved livestock feeding and breeding were 
included in IAM emission pathway scenarios within the SRCCL and 
SR1.5, although it was suggested that the full mitigation potential of 
enteric CH 4 measures is not captured in current models (Rogelj et al. 
2018b; IPCC 2018).
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, 
SROCC and SRCCL). Recent reviews generally identify the same 
measures as those outlined in the SRCCL, with the addition of early 
life manipulation of the ruminal biome (Grossi et al. 2019; Eckard 
and Clark 2020; Thompson and Rowntree 2020; Beauchemin 
et al. 2020; Ku-Vera et al. 2020; Honan et al. 2021). There is 
robust evidence and high agreement that chemically synthesised 
inhibitors are promising emerging near-term measures (Patra 2016; 
Jayanegara et al. 2018; Van Wesemael et al. 2019; Beauchemin et al. 2020) with high (e.g.,  16–70% depending on study) mitigation 
potential reported (e.g.,  Hristov et al. 2015; McGinn et al. 2019; 
Melgar et al. 2020) and commercial availability expected within 
two years in some countries (Reisinger et al. 2021). However, their 
mitigation persistence (McGinn et al. 2019), cost (Carroll and 
Daigneault 2019; Alvarez-Hess et al. 2019) and public acceptance 
(Jayasundara et al. 2016) or regulatory approval is currently 
unclear while administration in pasture-based systems is likely 
to be challenging (Patra et al. 2017; Leahy et al. 2019). Research 
into other inhibitors/feeds containing inhibitory compounds, such 
as macroalga or seaweed (Chagas et al. 2019; Kinley et al. 2020; 
Roque et al. 2019), shows promise, although concerns have been 
raised regarding palatability, toxicity, environmental impacts and 
the development of industrial-scale supply chains (Abbott et al. 
2020; Vijn et al. 2020). In the absence of CH 4 vaccines, which are still 
under development (Reisinger et al. 2021) pasture-based and non-
intensive systems remain reliant on increasing production efficiency 
(Beauchemin et al. 2020). Breeding of low emitting animals may 
play an important role and is a  subject under ongoing research 
(Pickering et al. 2015; Jonker et al. 2018; López-Paredes et al. 2020).
Approaches differ regionally, with more focus on direct, technical 
options in Developed Countries, and improved efficiency in 
developing countries (Caro Torres et al. 2016; Mottet et al. 2017b; 
MacLeod et al. 2018; Frank et al. 2018). A recent assessment finds 
greatest economic (up to USD100 tCO 2-eq–1) potential (using 
the IPCC AR4 GWP100 value for CH 4) for 2020–2050 in Asia and 
the Pacific (32.9 MtCO 2-eq yr–1) followed by Developed Countries 
(25.5 MtCO 2-eq yr–1) (Roe et al. 2021). Despite numerous country 
and sub-sector specific studies, most of which include cost analysis 
(Hasegawa and Matsuoka 2012; Hoa et al. 2014; Jilani et al. 2015; 
Eory et al. 2015; Pradhan et al. 2017; Pellerin et al. 2017; Ericksen and 
Crane 2018; Habib and Khan 2018; Kashangaki and Ericksen 2018; 
Salmon et al. 2018; Brandt et al. 2019b; Kiggundu et al. 2019; 
Kavanagh et al. 2019; Mosnier et al. 2019; Pradhan et al. 2019; Sapkota 
et al. 2019; Carroll and Daigneault 2019; Leahy et al. 2019; Dioha and 
Kumar 2020), sectoral assessment of regional technical and notably 
economic (Beach et al. 2015; USEPA 2019) potential is restricted by 
lack comprehensive and comparable data. Therefore, verification of 
regional estimates indicated by global assessments is challenging. 
Feed quality improvement, which may have considerable potential 
in developing countries (Caro et al. 2016; Mottet et al. 2017a), may 
have negative wider impacts. For example, potential land-use change 
and greater emissions associated with production of concentrates 
(Brandt et al. 2019b).Box 7.3 (continued)
Lessons
Successful examples of how more complex agroforestry can be upscaled do exist in Brazil. For example, on farm trials and consistent 
investments over several years have enabled Rizoma Agro to develop a citrus production system that integrates commercial and 
native trees in a large-scale multi-layered agroforestry system. The success of their transition resulted in part from their corporate 
structure that allowed them to tap into the certified Green Bonds market (CBI 2020). However, different transition strategies need to 
be developed for family farmers and their distinct socio-economic conditions.
using a  range of IPCC GWP100 values for CH 4, there is medium 
confidence that activities to reduce enteric CH 4 emissions have 
a global technical potential of 0.8 (0.2–1.2) GtCO 2-eq yr–1, of which 
0.2 (0.1–0.3) GtCO 2-eq yr–1 is available up to USD100 tCO 2-eq–1 
(Figure 7.11). The CO 2-eq value may also slightly differ if the GWP100 
IPCC AR6 CH 4 value was uniformly applied within calculations. Lack 
of comparable country and sub-sector studies to assess the context 
applicability of measures, associated costs and realistic adoption 
likelihood, prevents verification of estimates.
7.4.3.5 Improve Rice Management
Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities 
and barriers. Emissions from rice cultivation mainly concern CH 4 
associated with anaerobic conditions, although N 2O emission also 
occur via nitrification and denitrification processes. Measures to 
reduce CH 4 and N 2O emissions include (i) improved water management 
(e.g., single drainage and multiple drainage practices), (ii) improved 
residue management, (iii) improved fertiliser application (e.g., using 
slow release fertiliser and nutrient specific application), and (iv) soil 
amendments (including biochar and organic amendments) (Pandey 
et al. 2014; Kim et al. 2017b; Yagi et al. 2020; Sriphirom et al. 
2020). These measures not only have mitigation potential but can 
improve water use efficiency, reduce overall water use, enhance 
drought adaptation and overall system resilience, improve yield, 
reduce production costs from seed, pesticide, pumping and labour, 
increase farm income, and promote sustainable development 
(Quynh and Sander 2015; Yamaguchi et al. 2017; Tran et al. 2018; 
Sriphirom et al. 2019). However, in terms of mitigation of CH 4 and 
N2O, antagonistic effects can occur, whereby water management 
can enhance N 2O emissions due to creation of alternate wet and dry 
conditions (Sriphirom et al. 2019), with trade-offs between CH 4 and 
N2O during the drying period potentially offsetting some mitigation 
benefits. Barriers to adoption may include site-specific limitations 
regarding soil type, percolation and seepage rates or fluctuations 
in precipitation, water canal or irrigation infrastructure, paddy 
surface level and rice field size, and social factors including farmer 
perceptions, pump ownership, and challenges in synchronising water 
management between neighbours and pumping stations (Quynh and 
Sander 2015; Yamaguchi et al. 2017; Yamaguchi et al. 2019).
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC 
and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. The AR5 
outlined emissions from rice cultivation of 0.49–0.723 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 
in 2010 with an average annual growth of 0.4% yr–1. The SRCCL 
estimated a global mitigation potential from improved rice cultivation 
of 0.08–0.87 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 between 2020 and 2050, with the 
range representing the difference between technical and economic 
constraints, types of activities included (e.g.,  improved water 
management and straw residue management) and GHGs considered 
(Dickie et al. 2014a; Beach et al. 2015; Paustian et al. 2016; Griscom 
et al. 2017; Hawken 2017) (SRCCL, Chapter 2).Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, 
SROCC and SRCCL). Since AR5 and the SRCCL, studies on mitigation 
have principally focused on water and nutrient management 
practices with the aim of improving overall sustainability as well as 
measurements of site-specific emissions to help improve the resolution 
of regional estimates. Intensity of emissions show considerable 
spatial and temporal variation, dependent on site specific factors 
including degradation of soil organic matter, management of water 
levels in the field, the types and amount of fertilisers applied, rice 
variety and local cultivation practices. Variation in CH 4 emissions have 
been found to range from 0.5–41.8 mg m2 hr–1 in South-East Asia 
(Sander et al. 2014; Chidthaisong et al. 2018; Setyanto et al. 2018; 
Sibayan et al. 2018; J. Wang et al. 2018; Maneepitak et al. 2019), 
0.5–37.0 mg m2 hr–1 in Southern and Eastern Asia (Zhang et al. 2010; 
Wang et al. 2012; Oo et al. 2018; J. Wang et al. 2018; Takakai et al. 
2020), and 0.5–10.4 mg m2 hr–1 in North America (J.  Wang et al. 2018). 
Current studies on emissions of N 2O also showed high variation in 
the range of 0.13–654 ug/m2/hr (Akiyama et al. 2005; Islam et al. 
2018; Kritee et al. 2018; Zschornack et al. 2018; Oo et al. 2018).
Recent studies on water management have highlighted the potential 
to mitigate GHG emissions, while also enhancing water use efficiency 
(Tran et al. 2018). A  meta-analysis on multiple drainage systems 
found that Alternative Wetting and Drying (AWD) with irrigation 
management, can reduce CH 4 emissions by 20–30% and water use by 
25.7%, though this resulted in a slight yield reduction (5.4%) (Carrijo 
et al. 2017). Other studies have described improved yields associated 
with AWD (Tran et al. 2018). Water management for both single and 
multiple drainage can (most likely) reduce methane emissions by 
about 35% but increase N 2O emissions by about 20% (Yagi et al. 
2020). However, N 2O emissions occur only under dry conditions, 
therefore total reduction in terms of net GWP is approximately 
30%. Emissions of N 2O are higher during dry seasons (Yagi et al. 
2020) and depend on site specific factors as well as the quantity 
of fertiliser and organic matter inputs into the paddy rice system. 
Variability of N 2O emissions from single and multiple drainage can 
range from 0.06–33 kg/ha (Hussain et al. 2015; Kritee et al. 2018). 
AWD in Vietnam was found to reduce both CH 4 and N 2O emissions 
by 29–30 and 26–27% respectively with the combination of net 
GWP about 30% as compared to continuous flooding (Tran et al. 
2018). Overall, greatest average economic mitigation potential (up 
to USD100 tCO 2-eq–1) between 2020 and 2050 is estimated to be in 
Asia and the Pacific (147.2 MtCO 2-eq yr–1) followed by Latin America 
and the Caribbean (8.9 MtCO 2-eq yr–1) using the IPCC AR4 GWP100 
value for CH 4 (Roe et al. 2021).
Critical assessment and conclusion. There is medium confidence 
that improved rice management has a  technical potential of 
0.3  (0.1–0.8) GtCO 2-eq yr–1 between 2020 and 2050, of which 
0.2 (0.05–0.3) GtCO 2-eq yr–1 is available up to USD100 tCO 2-eq–1 
(Figure 7.11). Improving rice cultivation practices will not only reduce 
GHG emissions, but also improve production sustainability in terms 
of resource utilisation including water consumption and fertiliser 
application. However, emission reductions show high variability and 
are dependent on site specific conditions and cultivation practices.
Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities 
and barriers. Improved crop nutrient management can reduce N 2O 
emissions from cropland soils. Practices include optimising fertiliser 
application delivery, rates and timing, utilising different fertiliser 
types (i.e., organic manures, composts and synthetic forms), and 
using slow or controlled-released fertilisers or nitrification inhibitors 
(Smith et al. 2014; Griscom et al. 2017; P .  Smith et al. 2019a). In 
addition to individual practices, integrated nutrient management that 
combines crop rotations including intercropping, nitrogen biological 
fixation, reduced tillage, use of cover crops, manure and bio-fertiliser 
application, soil testing and comprehensive nitrogen management 
plans, is suggested as central for optimising fertiliser use, enhancing 
nutrient uptake and potentially reducing N 2O emissions (Bationo 
et al. 2012; Lal et al. 2018; Bolinder et al. 2020; Jensen et al. 2020; 
Namatsheve et al. 2020). Such practices may generate additional 
mitigation by indirectly reducing synthetic fertiliser manufacturing 
requirements and associated emissions, though such mitigation 
is accounted for in the Industry Sector and not considered in this 
chapter. Tailored nutrient management approaches, such as 4R 
nutrient stewardship, are implemented in contrasting farming 
systems and contexts and supported by best management practices 
to balance and match nutrient supply with crop requirements, 
provide greater stability in fertiliser performance and to minimise 
N2O emissions and nutrient losses from fields and farms (Fixen 2020; 
Maaz et al. 2021). Co-benefits of improved nutrient management 
can include enhanced soil quality (notably when manure, crop 
residues or compost is utilised), carbon sequestration in soils and 
biomass, soil water holding capacity, adaptation capacity, crop 
yields, farm incomes, water quality (from reduced nitrate leaching 
and eutrophication), air quality (from reduced ammonia emissions) 
and in certain cases, it may facilitate land sparing (Sapkota et al. 
2014; Johnston and Bruulsema 2014; Zhang et al. 2017; P . Smith et al. 
2019a; Mbow et al. 2019).
A potential risk under certain circumstances, is yield reduction, while 
implementation of practices should consider current soil nutrient 
status. There are significant regional imbalances, with some regions 
experiencing nutrient surpluses from over fertilisation and others, 
nutrient shortages and chronic deficiencies (FAO 2021e). Additionally, 
depending on context, practices may be inaccessible, expensive or 
require expertise to implement (Hedley 2015; Benson and Mogues 
2018) while impacts of climate change may influence nutrient use 
efficiency (Amouzou et al. 2019) and therefore, mitigation potential.
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC 
and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. The 
SRCCL broadly identified the same practices as outlined in AR5 
and estimated that improved cropland nutrient management could 
mitigate between 0.03 and 0.71 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 between 2020 and 

Paustian et al. 2016; Griscom et al. 2017; Hawken 2017).Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, 
SROCC and SRCCL). Research since the SRCCL highlights the 
mitigation potential and co-benefits of adopting improved nutrient 
management strategies, notably precision fertiliser application 
methods and nutrient expert systems, and applicability in both 
large-scale mechanised and small-scale systems (USEPA 2019; 
Hijbeek et al. 2019; Griscom et al. 2020; Tian et al. 2020; Aryal et al. 
2020; Sapkota et al. 2021). Improved crop nutrient management is 
feasible in all regions, but effectiveness is context dependent. Sub-
Saharan Africa has one of the lowest global fertiliser consumption 
rates, with increased fertiliser use suggested as necessary to meet 
projected future food requirements (Mueller et al. 2012; ten Berge 
et al. 2019; Adam et al. 2020; Falconnier et al. 2020). Fertiliser use 
in Developed Countries is already high (Figure 7.10) with increased 
nutrient use efficiency among the most promising mitigation 
measures (Roe et al. 2019; Hijbeek et al. 2019). Considering that 
Asia and Pacific, and Developed Countries accounted for the greatest 
share of global nitrogen fertiliser use, it is not surprising that these 
regions are estimated to have greatest economic mitigation potential 
(up to USD100 tCO 2-eq–1) between 2020 and 2050, at 161.8 and 
37.1 MtCO 2-eq yr–1 respectively (using the IPCC AR4 GWP100  value 
for N 2O) (Roe et al. 2021).
Critical assessment and conclusion. There is medium confidence 
that crop nutrient management has a  technical potential of 
0.3 (0.06–0.7) GtCO 2-eq yr–1 of which 0.2 (0.05–0.6) GtCO 2-eq yr–1 
is available up to USD100 tCO 2-eq–1. This value is based on GWP100 
using a  mixture of IPCC values for N 2O and may slightly differ if 
calculated using AR6 values. The development of national roadmaps 
for sustainable fertiliser (nutrient) management can help in scaling-
up related practices and in realising this potential. Crop nutrient 
management measures can contribute not only to mitigation, but food 
and nutrition security and wider environmental sustainability goals.
Summary
The climate-smart villages (CSV) approach aims to generate local knowledge, with the involvement of farmers, researchers, practitioners, 
and governments, on climate change adaptation and mitigation while improving productivity, food security, and farmers’ livelihoods 
(Aggarwal et al. 2018). This knowledge feeds a global network that includes 36 climate-smart villages in South and South-East Asia, 
West and East Africa, and Latin America.
Background
It is expected that agricultural production systems across the world will change in response to climate change, posing significant 
challenges to the livelihoods and food security of millions of people (Kennedy et al. 2014). Maintaining agricultural growth while 
minimising climate shocks is crucial to building a resilient food production system and meeting sustainable development goals in 
vulnerable countries.
Case description
The CSV approach seeks an integrated vision so that sustainable rural development is the final goal for rural communities. At the 
same time, it fosters the understanding of climate change with the implementation of adaptation and mitigation actions, as much as 
possible. Rural communities and local stakeholders are the leaders of this process, where scientists facilitate their knowledge to be 
useful for the communities and learn at the same time about challenges but also the capacity those communities have built through 
time. The portfolio includes weather-smart activities, water-smart practices, seed/breed smart, carbon-/nutrient-smart practices, and 
institutional-/market-smart activities.
Interactions and limitations
The integration of technologies and services that are suitable for the local conditions resulted in many gains for food security and 
adaptation and for mitigation where appropriate. It was also shown that, in all regions, there is considerable yield advantage when 
a portfolio of technologies is used, rather than the isolated use of technologies (Govaerts et al. 2005; Zougmoré et al. 2014). Moreover, 
farmers are using research results to promote their products as climate-smart leading to increases in their income (Acosta-Alba 
et al. 2019). However, climatic risk sites and socio-economic conditions together with a lack of resource availability are key issues 
constraining agriculture across all five regions.
Lessons
i. Understanding the priorities, context, challenges, capacity, and characteristics of the territory and the communities regarding 
climate, as well as the environmental and socio-economic dimensions, is the first step. Then, understanding climate vulnerability 
in their agricultural systems based on scientific data but also listening to their experience will set the pathway to identify climate-
smart agriculture (CSA) options (practices and technologies) to reduce such vulnerability.
ii. Building capacity is also a critical element of the CSV approach, rural families learn about the practices and technologies in 
a neighbour’s house, and as part of the process, families commit to sharing their knowledge with other families, to start a scaling-
out process within the communities. Understanding the relationship between climate and their crop is key, as well as the use of 
weather forecasts to plan their agricultural activities.
The assessment of the implementation of the CSA options should be done together with community leaders to understand changes 
in livelihoods and climate vulnerability. Also, knowledge appropriation by community leaders has led to farmer-to-farmer knowledge 
exchange within and outside the community (Ortega Fernandez and Martínez-Barón 2018).
7.4.3.7 Manure Management
Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities 
and barriers. Manure management measures aim to mitigate CH 4 
and N 2O emissions from manure storage and deposition. Mitigation 
of N 2O considers both direct and indirect (i.e., conversion of ammonia 
and nitrate to N 2O) sources. According to the SRCCL, measures may 
include (i) anaerobic digestion, (ii) applying nitrification or urease 
inhibitors to stored manure or urine patches, (iii) composting, (iv) improved storage and application practices, (v) grazing practices 
and (vi) alteration of livestock diets to reduce nitrogen excretion 
(Mbow et al. 2019; Jia et al. 2019). Implementation of manure 
management with other livestock and soil management measures 
can enhance system resilience, sustainability, food security and help 
prevent land degradation (Smith et al. 2014; Mbow et al. 2019; 
P .  Smith et al. 2019a), while potentially benefiting the localised 
environment, for example, regarding water quality (Di and Cameron 
2016). Risks include increased N 2O emission from the application 
and ammonia emissions and potential eco-toxicity associated with 
some measures.
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC 
and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. The  
AR5 reported manure measures to have high (>10%) mitigation 
potential. The SRCCL estimated a  technical global mitigation 
potential between 2020 and 2050 of 0.01–0.26 GtCO 2-eq yr–1, with 
the range depending on economic and sustainable capacity (Dickie 
et al. 2014a; Herrero et al. 2016) (SRCCL, Chapter 2). Conversion of 
estimates to native units is restricted as a mixture of GWP100 values 
was used in underlying studies. Measures considered were typically 
more suited to confined production systems (Jia et al. 2019; Mbow 
et al. 2019), while improved manure management is included within 
IAM emission pathways (Rogelj et al. 2018b).
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, 
SROCC and SRCCL). Research published since SRCCL broadly 
focuses on measures relevant to intensive or confined systems 
(e.g., (Hunt et al. 2019; Kavanagh et al. 2019; Sokolov et al. 2020; 
Im et al. 2020; Adghim et al. 2020; Mostafa et al. 2020), highlighting 
co-benefits and risks. For example, measures may enhance nutrient 
recovery, fertiliser value (Sefeedpari et al. 2019; Ba et al. 2020; Yao 
et al. 2020) and secondary processes such as biogas production 
(Shin et al. 2019). However, the potential antagonistic relationship 
between GHG and ammonia mitigation and need for appropriate 
management is emphasised (Aguirre-Villegas et al. 2019; Grossi et 
al. 2019; Kupper et al. 2020; Ba et al. 2020). In some circumstances, 
fugitive emissions may reduce the potential mitigation benefits of 
biogas production (Scheutz and Fredenslund 2019; Bakkaloglu et al. 
2021), while high implementation cost is identified as an adoption 
barrier, notably of anaerobic digestion (Liu and Liu 2018; Niles and 
Wiltshire 2019; Ndambi et al. 2019; Ackrill and Abdo 2020; Adghim 
et al. 2020). Nitrification inhibitors have been found to be effective 
at reducing N 2O emissions from pasture deposited urine (López-
Aizpún et al. 2020), although the use of nitrification inhibitors is restricted in some jurisdictions due to concerns regarding residues 
in food products (Di  and Cameron 2016; Eckard and Clark 2020) 
while limited evidence suggests eco-toxicity risk under certain 
circumstances (Kösler et al. 2019). Some forage crops may naturally 
contain inhibitory substances (Simon et al. 2019, 2020; de Klein et al. 
2020), though this warrants further research (Podolyan et al. 2020; 
Gardiner et al. 2020).
Country specific studies provide insight into regionally applicable 
measures, with emphasis on small-scale anaerobic digestion 
(e.g.,  dome digesters), solid manure coverage and daily manure 
spreading in Asia and the Pacific, and Africa (Hasegawa and Matsuoka 
2012; Hoa et al. 2014; Jilani et al. 2015; Hasegawa et al. 2016; Pradhan 
et al. 2017; Ericksen and Crane 2018; Pradhan et al. 2019; Kiggundu 
et al. 2019; Dioha and Kumar 2020). Tank/lagoon covers, large-scale 
anaerobic digestion, improved application timing, nitrogen inhibitor 
application to urine patches, soil-liquid separation, reduced livestock 
nitrogen intake, trailing shoe, band or injection slurry spreading and 
acidification are emphasised in Developed Countries (Kaparaju and 
Rintala 2011; Eory et al. 2015; Pape et al. 2016; Jayasundara et al. 
2016; Pellerin et al. 2017; Liu and Liu 2018; Lanigan et al. 2018; 
Carroll and Daigneault 2019; Eckard and Clark 2020). Using IPCC 
AR4 GWP100 values for CH 4 and N 2O, a recent assessment finds 69% 
(63.4 MtCO 2-eq yr–1) of economic potential (up to USD100 tCO 2-eq–1) 
between 2020–2050, to be in Developed Countries (Roe et al. 2021).
Critical assessment and conclusion. There is medium confidence 
that manure management measures have a global technical potential 
of 0.3 (0.1–0.5) GtCO 2-eq yr–1, (using a range of IPCC GWP100 values 
for CH 4 and N 2O), of which 0.1 (0.09–0.1) GtCO 2-eq yr–1 is available 
at up to USD100 tCO 2-eq–1 (Figure  7.11). As with other non-CO 2 
GHG mitigation estimates, values may slightly differ depending upon 
which IPCC GWP100 values were used. There is robust evidence and 
high agreement that there are measures that can be applied in all 
regions, but greatest mitigation potential is estimated in Developed 
Countries in more intensive and confined production systems.
Box 7.5 | Farming System Approaches and Mitigation
Introduction
There is robust evidence and high agreement that agriculture needs to change to facilitate environment conservation while 
maintaining and where appropriate, increase overall production. The SRCCL identified several farming system approaches, deemed 
alternative to conventional systems (Olsson et al. 2019; Mbow et al. 2019; L.G. Smith et al. 2019). These may incorporate several of the 
mitigation measures described in Section 7.4.3, while potentially also delivering environmental co-benefits. This Box assesses evidence 
specifically on the mitigation capacity of some such system approaches. The approaches are not mutually exclusive, may share similar 
principles or practices and can be complimentary. In all cases, mitigation may result from either (i) emission reductions or (ii) enhanced 
carbon sequestration, via combinations of management practices as outlined in Figure 1 within this Box. The approaches will have 
pros and cons concerning multiple factors, including mitigation, yield and co-benefits, with trade-offs subject to the diverse contexts 
and ways in which they are implemented.

Is there evidence that these approaches deliver mitigation?
 
Agroecology (AE) including Regenerative Agriculture (RA)
There is limited discussion on the mitigation potential of AE (Gliessman 2013; Altieri and Nicholls 2017), but robust evidence that 
AE can improve system resilience and bring multiple co-benefits (Altieri et al. 2015; Mbow et al. 2019; Aguilera et al. 2020; Tittonell 
2020; Wanger et al. 2020) (AR6 WGII Box 5.10). Limited evidence concerning the mitigation capacity of AE at a system level (Saj 
et al. 2017; Snapp et al. 2021) makes conclusions difficult, yet studies into specific practices that may be incorporated, suggest AE 
may have mitigation potential (medium confidence) (Section 7.4.3). However, AE, that incorporates management practices used in 
organic farming (see below), may result in reduced yields, driving compensatory agricultural production elsewhere. Research into 
GHG mitigation by AE as a system and impacts of wide-scale implementation is required. Despite absence of a universally accepted 
definition (see Annex I), RA is gaining increasing attention and shares principles of AE. Some descriptions include carbon sequestration 
as a specific aim (Elevitch et al. 2018). Few studies have assessed mitigation potential of RA at a system level (e.g., Colley et al. 2020). 
Like AE, it is likely that RA can contribute to mitigation, the extent to which is currently unclear and by its case-specific design, will 
vary (medium confidence).
Conservation agriculture (CA)
The SRCCL noted both positive and inconclusive results regarding CA and soil carbon, with sustained sequestration dependent on 
productivity and residue returns (Jia et al. 2019; Mirzabaev et al. 2019; Mbow et al. 2019). Recent research is in broad agreement 
(Ogle et al. 2019; Corbeels et al. 2020, 2019; Gonzalez-Sanchez et al. 2019; Munkholm et al. 2020) with greatest mitigation potential 
suggested in dry regions (Sun et al. 2020). Theoretically, CA may facilitate improved nitrogen use efficiency (limited evidence) (Lal 
2015; Powlson et al. 2016), though CA appears to have mixed effects on soil N 2O emission (Six et al. 2004; Mei et al. 2018). CA is 
noted for its adaptation benefits, with wide agreement that CA can enhance system resilience to climate related stress, notably in dry 
regions. There is evidence that CA can contribute to mitigation, but its contribution is depended on multiple factors including climate 
and residue returns (high confidence).
Integrated production systems (IPS)
The integration of different enterprises in space and time (e.g., diversified cropping, crop and livestock production, agroforestry), 
therefore facilitating interaction and transfer of recourses between systems, is suggested to enhance sustainability and adaptive 
capacity (Hendrickson et al. 2008; Franzluebbers et al. 2014; Lemaire et al. 2014; Weindl et al. 2015; Gil et al. 2017; Olsson et al. 2019; 
Peterson et al. 2020; Walkup et al. 2020; Garrett et al. 2020). Research indicates some mitigation potential, including by facilitating 
sustainable intensification (Box 7.11), though benefits are likely to be highly context specific (Herrero et al. 2013; Carvalho et al. 2014; 
Piva et al. 2014; de Figueiredo et al. 2017; Rosenstock et al. 2014; Weindl et al. 2015; Thornton and Herrero 2015; Descheemaeker et al. 
2016; Lal 2020; Guenet et al. 2021). The other systems outlined within this Box may form or facilitate IPS.
Organic farming (OF)
OF can be considered a form of AE (Lampkin et al. 2017) though it is discussed separately here as it is guided by specific principles 
and associated regulations (Annex I). OF is perhaps noted more for potential co-benefits, such as enhanced system resilience and 
biodiversity promotion, than mitigation. Several studies have reviewed the emissions footprint of organic compared to conventional 
systems (Mondelaers et al. 2009; Tuomisto et al. 2012; Skinner et al. 2014; Meier et al. 2015; Seufert and Ramankutty 2017; Clark and 
Tilman 2017; Meemken and Qaim 2018; Bellassen et al. 2021). Acknowledging potential assessment limitations (Meier et al. 2015; 
van der Werf et al. 2020), evidence suggests organic production to typically generate lower emissions per unit of area, while emissions 
per unit of product vary and depend on the product (high agreement, medium evidence). OF has been suggested to increase soil 
carbon sequestration (Gattinger et al. 2012), though definitive conclusions are challenging (Leifeld et al. 2013). Fewer studies consider 
impacts of large-scale conversion from conventional to organic production globally. Though context specific (Seufert and Ramankutty 
2017), OF is reported to typically generate lower yields (Seufert et al. 2012; De Ponti et al. 2012; Kirchmann 2019; Biernat et al. 2020). 
Large-scale conversion, without fundamental changes in food systems and diets (Muller et al. 2017; Theurl et al. 2020), may lead to 
increases in absolute emissions from land-use change, driven by greater land requirements to maintain production (L.G. Smith et al. 
2019; Leifeld 2016; Meemken and Qaim 2018).
Objective
To assess the technical mitigation potentials of Indian agriculture and costs under a business as usual scenario (BAU) and Mitigation 
scenario up to 2030 (Sapkota et al. 2019).
Results
The study shows that by 2030 under BAU scenario GHG emissions from the agricultural sector in India would be 515 MtCO 2-eq yr–1 
(using GWP100 and IPCC AR4 values) with a technical mitigation potential of 85.5 MtCO 2-eq yr–1 through the adoption of various 
mitigation practices. About 80% of the technical mitigation potential could be achieved by adopting cost-saving measures. 
Three mitigation options, for example, efficient use of fertiliser, zero-tillage, and rice-water management, could deliver more than 50% 
of the total technical abatement potential. Under the BAU scenario the projected GHG emissions from major crop and livestock species 
is estimated at 489 MtCO 2-eq in 2030, whereas under mitigation scenario GHG emissions are estimated at 410 MtCO 2-eq implying 
a technical mitigation option of about 78.67 MtCO 2-eq yr–1 (Box 7.6, Figure 1). Major sources of projected emissions under the BAU 
scenario, in order of importance, were cattle, rice, buffalo, and small ruminants. Although livestock production and rice cultivation 
account for a major share of agricultural emissions, the highest mitigation potential was observed in rice (about 36 MtCO 2-eq yr–1) 
followed by buffalo (about 14 MtCO 2-eq yr–1), wheat (about 11 MtCO 2-eq yr–1) and cattle (about 7 MtCO 2-eq yr–1). Crops such as 
cotton and sugarcane each offered mitigation potential of about 5 MtCO 2-eq yr–1 while the mitigation potential from small ruminants 
(goat/sheep) was about 2 MtCO 2-eq yr–1.
Sapkota et al. (2019) also estimated the magnitude of GHG savings 
per year through adoption of various mitigation measures, together 
with the total cost and net cost per unit of CO 2-eq abated. When 
the additional benefits of increased yield due to adoption of the 
mitigation measures were considered, about 80% of the technical 
mitigation potential (67.5 out of 85.5 MtCO 2-eq) could be achieved 
by cost-saving measures. When yield benefits were considered, 
green fodder supplements to ruminant diets were the most cost-
effective mitigation measure, followed by vermicomposting 
and improved diet management of small ruminants. Mitigation 
measures such as fertigation and micro-irrigation, various methods 
of restoring degraded land and feed additives in livestock appear 
to be cost-prohibitive, even when considering yield benefits, if 
any. The study accounted for GHG emissions at the farm level 
and excluded emissions arising due to processing, marketing or 
consumption post farm-gate. It also did not include emissions 
from feed production, since livestock in India mostly rely on crop 
by-products and concentrates. Further the potential of laser land 
levelling seems exaggerated which may also be redundant with 
already accounted potential from ‘improved water management 
in rice’. The mitigation potential of agroecological approaches/
technologies such as natural farming which is picking up in India in 
recent years has also been overlooked.Box  7.6, Figure  1 | Contribution of various crops and livestock 
species to total agricultural emission in 2012 (baseline) and by 2030

7.4.4 Bioenergy and BECCS
Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation 
opportunities and barriers.  Bioenergy refers to energy products 
(solid, liquid and gaseous fuels, electricity, heat) derived from 
multiple biomass sources including organic waste, harvest residues 
and by-flows in the agriculture and forestry sectors, and biomass 
from tree plantations, agroforestry systems, lignocellulosic crops, 
and conventional food/feed crops. It may reduce net GHG emissions 
by displacing the use of coal, oil and natural gas with renewable 
biomass in the production of heat, electricity, and fuels. When combined with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and biochar 
production, bioenergy systems may provide CDR by durably storing 
biogenic carbon in geological, terrestrial, or ocean reservoirs, or 
in products, further contributing to mitigation (Chum et al. 2011; 
Cabral et al. 2019; Hammar and Levihn 2020; Emenike et al. 2020; 
Moreira et al. 2020b; Y . Wang et al. 2020: Johnsson et al. 2020) 
(Section 7.4.3.2, Chapters 3, 4, 6 and 12).
This section addresses especially aspects related to land use and 
biomass supply for bioenergy and BECCS. The mitigation potential 
presented here and in Table 7.3, includes only the CDR component of 

is covered elsewhere (Chapters 6, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12).
Modern bioenergy systems (as opposed to traditional use of fuelwood 
and other low-quality cooking and heating fuels) currently provide 
approximately 30 EJ yr–1 of primary energy, making up 53% of total 
renewable primary energy supply (IEA 2019). Bioenergy systems 
are commonly integrated within forest and agriculture systems that 
produce food, feed, lumber, paper and other bio-based products. 
They can also be combined with other AFOLU mitigation options: 
deployment of energy crops, agroforestry and A/R can provide 
biomass while increasing land carbon stocks (Sections 7.4.2.2 and 
7.4.3.3) and anaerobic digestion of manure and wastewater, to 
reduce methane emissions, can produce biogas and CO 2 for storage 
(Section 7.4.3.7). But ill-deployment of energy crops can also cause 
land carbon losses (Hanssen et al. 2020) and increased biomass 
demand for energy could hamper other mitigation measures such as 
reduced deforestation and degradation (Sections 7.4.2.1).
Bioenergy and BECCS can be associated with a range of co-benefits 
and adverse side effects (Smith et al. 2016; Jia et al. 2019; Calvin 
et al. 2021) (Section  12.5). It is difficult to disentangle bioenergy 
development from the overall development in the AFOLU sector 
given its multiple interactions with food, land, and energy systems. It 
is therefore not possible to precisely determine the scale of bioenergy 
and BECCS deployment at which negative impacts outweigh 
benefits. Important uncertainties include governance systems, 
future food and biomaterials demand, land-use practices, energy 
systems development, climate impacts, and time scale considered 
when weighing negative impacts against benefits (Robledo-Abad 
et al. 2017; Turner et al. 2018b; Daioglou et al. 2019; Wu et al. 2019; 
Kalt et al. 2020; Hanssen et al. 2020; Calvin et al. 2021; Cowie et al. 
2021) (SRCCL, Cross-Chapter Box 7; Box 7.7). The use of municipal 
organic waste, harvest residues, and biomass processing by-products 
as feedstock is commonly considered to have relatively lower risk, 
provided that associated land-use practices are sustainable (Cowie 
et al. 2021). Deployment of dedicated biomass production systems 
can have positive and negative implications on mitigation and 
other sustainability criteria, depending on location and previous 
land use, feedstock, management practice, deployment strategy 
and scale (Rulli et al. 2016; Popp et al. 2017; Daioglou et al. 2017; 
Staples et al. 2017; Carvalho et al. 2017; Humpenöder et al. 2018; 
Fujimori et al. 2019; Hasegawa et al. 2020; Drews et al. 2020; Schulze 
et al. 2020; Stenzel et al. 2020; Mouratiadou et al. 2020; Buchspies et al. 
2020; Hanssen et al. 2020, IPBES 2019b) (Sections 12.5 and 17.3.3.1).
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC 
and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. Many 
more stringent mitigation scenarios in AR5 relied heavily on bioenergy 
and BECCS. The SR1.5 reported a  range for the CDR potential of 
BECCS (2100) at 0.5 to 5 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 when applying constraints 
reflecting sustainability concerns, at a cost of 100–200 USD tCO 2–1 
(Fuss et al. 2018). The SRCCL reported a technical CDR potential for 
BECCS at 0.4–11.3 GtCO 2 yr–1 (medium confidence), noting that 
most estimates do not include socio-economic barriers, the impacts 
of future climate change, or non-GHG climate forcing (IPCC. 2019). 
The SR1.5 and SRCCL highlighted that bioenergy and BECCS can be associated with multiple co-benefits and adverse side effects that are 
context specific.
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, 
SROCC and SRCCL). The role of bioenergy and BECCS in mitigation 
pathways has been reduced as IAM-based studies have incorporated 
broader mitigation portfolios and have explored non-CO 2 emissions 
reduction and a  wider variation of underlying assumptions about 
socio-economic drivers and associated energy and food demand, 
as well as deployment limits such as land availability for A/R and 
for cultivation of crops used for bioenergy and BECCS (Grubler et al. 
2018; Van Vuuren et al. 2018).
Increased availability of spatially explicit data and advances in 
the modelling of crop productivity and land use, land carbon 
stocks, hydrology, and ecosystem properties, have enabled more 
comprehensive analyses of factors that influence the contribution of 
bioenergy and BECCS in IAM-based mitigation scenarios, and also 
associated co-benefits and adverse side effects (Turner et al.2018a; 
Wu et al. 2019, Li et al. 2020, Hanssen et al. 2020; Drews et al. 2020; 
Ai et al. 2021; Hasegawa et al. 2021). Yet, IAMs are still coarse in 
local land-use practices. (Daioglou et al. 2019; Wu et al. 2019; 
Moreira et al. 2020b). Literature complementary to IAM studies 
indicate opportunities for integration of biomass production systems 
into agricultural landscapes (e.g.,  agroforestry, double cropping) 
to produce biomass while achieving co-benefits (Section  12.5). 
Similarly, climate-smart forestry puts forward measures (Box  7.3) 
adapted to regional circumstances in forest sectors, enabling co-
benefits in nature conservation, soil protection, employment and 
income generation, and provision of wood for buildings, bioenergy 
and other bio-based products (Nabuurs et al. 2017).
Studies have also investigated the extent and possible use of 
marginal, abandoned, and degraded lands, and approaches to help 
restore the productive value of these lands (Awasthi et al. 2017; 
Fritsche et al. 2017; Chiaramonti and Panoutsou, 2018; Fernando 
et al. 2018; Elbersen et al. 2019; Rahman et al. 2019; Næss et al. 
2021). In the SRCCL, the presented range for degraded or abandoned 
land was 32–1400 Mha (Jia et al. 2019). Recent regional assessments 
not included in the SRCCL found up to 69 Mha in EU-28, 185 Mha 
in China, 9.5 Mha in Canada, and 127 Mha in the USA (Emery et al. 
2017; Liu et al. 2017; Elbersen et al. 2019; Zhang et al.2020; Vera 
et al. 2021). The definitions of marginal/abandoned/degraded land, 
and the methods used to assess such lands remain inconsistent 
across studies (Jiang et al. 2019), causing large variation amongst 
them (Jiang et al. 2021). Furthermore, the availability of such lands 
has been contested since they may serve other functions, such as: 
subsistence, biodiversity protection, and so on (Baka 2014).
Besides emissions, and possible avoided emissions, related to the supply chain, the GHG effects of using bioenergy depend on: 
(i) change in GHG emissions when bioenergy substitutes another energy source; and (ii) how the associated land use and possible land-
use change influence the amount of carbon that is stored in vegetation and (Calvin et al. 2021) soils over time. Studies arrive at varying 
mitigation potentials for bioenergy and BECCS due to the large diversity of bioenergy systems, and varying conditions concerning 
where and how they are deployed (Elshout 2015; Harper et al.2018; Muri 2018; Kalt et al.2019; Brandão et al. 2019; Buchspies et al. 
2020; Cowie et al. 2021; Calvin et al. 2021). Important factors include feedstock type, land management practice, energy conversion 
efficiency, type of bioenergy product (and possible co-products), emissions intensity of the products being displaced, and the land use/
cover prior to bioenergy deployment (Zhu et al. 2017; Staples et al. 2017; Daioglou et al. 2017; Carvalho et al. 2017; Hanssen et al. 
2020; Mouratiadou et al. 2020). Studies arrive at contrasting conclusions also when similar bioenergy systems and conditions are 
analysed, due to different methodologies, assumptions, and parametrization (Harper et al.2018; Kalt et al.2019; Brandão et al. 2019; 
Albers et al. 2019; Buchspies et al. 2020; Bessou et al. 2020; Rolls and Forster 2020; Cowie et al. 2021).
Box 7.7, Figure 1 shows emissions associated with biomass supply (residues and crops grown on cropland not needed for food) in 
2050, here designated emission-supply curves. The curves are constructed assuming that additional biomass supply consistently comes 
from the available land/biomass resource that has the lowest GHG emissions, for example, the marginal GHG emissions increase with 
increasing biomass use for bioenergy. Net negative emissions indicate cases where biomass production increases land carbon stocks.

Box 7.7, Figure 1 | Emissions associated with primary biomass supply in 2050 (residues and crops grown on cropland not needed for food), 
as determined from sectoral models (Daioglou et al. 2017; Kalt et al. 2020), and stylised scenarios from the EMF-33 project using Integrated 
Assessment Models (Rose et al. 2020). All methods include LUC (direct and indirect) emissions. Emissions associated with Natural Regrowth include counterfactual 
carbon fluxes (see text). The sectoral models include a more detailed representation of the emissions, including lifecycle emissions from fertiliser production. IAM 
models may include economic feedbacks such as intensification as a result of increasing prices. As an indication: for natural gas the emission factor is around 56, for 
coal around 95 kgCO 2 GJ–1.
One curve (EMF-33) is determined from stylised scenarios using IAMs (Rose et al. 2020). One of the two curves determined from 
sectoral models, Constant Land Cover, reflects supply chain emissions and changes in land carbon storage caused by the biomass 
supply system itself. These two curves are obtained with modelling approaches compatible with the modelling protocol used for the 
scenarios in the AR6 database, which accounts for the land-use change and all other GHG emissions along a given transformation 
trajectory, enabling assessments of the warming level incurred.
The Natural Regrowth curve attribute additional ‘counterfactual emissions’ to the bioenergy system, corresponding to estimated 
uptake of CO 2 in a counterfactual scenario where land is not used for bioenergy but instead subject to natural vegetation regrowth. 
This curve does not show actual emissions from the bioenergy system, but it provides insights in the mitigation value of the bioenergy 
option compared to alternative land-use strategies. To illustrate, if biomass is used instead of a primary energy source with emission 
factor 75 kgCO 2 GJ–1, and the median values in the Natural Regrowth curve are adopted, then the curve indicates that up to about 

same land for natural vegetation regrowth (assuming same conversion factor).
The large ranges in the bars signify the importance of uncertainties and how the biomass is deployed. Variation in energy conversion 
efficiencies and uncertainty about magnitude, timing, and permanence of land carbon storage further complicate the comparison. 
Finally, not shown in Box 7.7, Figure 1, the emission-supply curves would be adjusted downwards if displacement of emission intensive 
energy was included or if the bioenergy is combined with CCS to provide CDR.
Critical assessment and conclusion. Recent estimates of technical 
biomass potentials constrained by food security and environmental 
considerations fall within previous ranges corresponding to medium 
agreement, (e.g.,  Turner et al. 2018b; Daioglou et al. 2019; Wu 
et al. 2019, Hansen et al.2020; Kalt et al. 2020) arriving at 4–57 
and 46–245 EJ yr–1 by 2050 for residues and dedicated biomass 
crops, respectively. Based on studies to date, the technical net 
CDR potential of BECCS (including LUC and other supply chain 
emissions, but excluding energy carrier substitution) by 2050 is 
5.9 (0.5–11.3) GtCO 2 yr–1 globally, of which 1.6 (0.5–3.5) GtCO 2 yr–1 
is available at below USD100 tCO 2–1 (medium confidence) (Lenton 
2010; Koornneef et al. 2012; McLaren 2012; Powell and Lenton 2012; 
Fuss et al. 2018; Turner et al. 2018a; Hanssen et al. 2020; Roe et al. 
2021) (Figure  7.11). The equivalent economic potential as derived 
from IAMs is 1.8 (0.2–9.9) GtCO 2 yr–1 (Table 7.3).
Technical land availability does not imply that dedicated biomass 
production for bioenergy and BECCS is the most effective use of this 
land for mitigation. Further, implications of deployment for climate 
change mitigation and other sustainability criteria are context 
dependent and influenced by many factors, including rate and total 
scale. While governance has a critical influence on outcome, larger 
scale and higher expansion rate generally translates into higher risk 
for negative outcomes for GHG emissions, biodiversity, food security 
and a  range of other sustainability criteria (Searchinger 2017; 
Vaughan et al. 2018; Rochedo et al. 2018; de Oliveira Garcia et al. 
2018; Daioglou et al. 2019; Junginger et al. 2019; Galik et al. 2020; 
Stenzel et al. 2020).
However, literature has also highlighted how the agriculture and 
forestry sectors may respond to increasing demand by devising 
management approaches that enable biomass production for energy 
in conjunction with supply of food, construction timber, and other bio-based products, providing climate change mitigation while enabling 
multiple co-benefits including for nature conservation (Nabuurs 
et al. 2017; Parodi et al. 2018; Springmann et al. 2018; Rosenzweig 
et al. 2020; Clark et al. 2020; Favero et al. 2020; Hanssen et al. 2020) 
(Section 7.4 and Cross-Working Group Box 3 in Chapter 12).
Strategies to enhance the benefits of bioenergy and BECCS 
include (i)  management practices that protect carbon stocks and 
the productive and adaptive capacity of lands, as well as their 
environmental and social functions (van Ittersum et al. 2013, Gerssen-
Gondelach et al. 2015; Moreira et al. 2020b) (ii) supply chains from 
primary production to final consumption that are well managed and 
deployed at appropriate levels (Fajardy et al. 2018; Donnison et al. 
2020); and (iii) development of a cross-sectoral agenda for bio-based 
production within a circular economy, and international cooperation 
and governance of global trade in products to maximise synergies 
while limiting trade-offs concerning environmental, economic 
and social outcomes (very high confidence). Finally, the technical 
feasibility of BECCS depends on investments in and the roll-out of 
advanced bioenergy technologies currently not widely available 
(Baker et al. 2015; Daioglou et al. 2020b).
7.4.5 Demand-side Measures
7.4.5.1 Shift to Sustainable Healthy Diets
Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities 
and barriers. The term ‘sustainable healthy diets’ refers to dietary 
patterns that ‘promote all dimensions of individuals’ health and well-
being; have low environmental pressure and impact; are accessible, 
affordable, safe and equitable; and are culturally acceptable’ 
(FAO and WHO 2019). In addition to climate mitigation gains, 
consumption of animal-based foods, particularly from ruminant 
animals, could reduce pressure on forests and land used for feed, 
support the preservation of biodiversity and planetary health (FAO 
2018c; Theurl et al. 2020), and contribute to preventing forms of 
malnutrition (i.e.,  undernutrition, micronutrient deficiency, and 
obesity) in developing countries (Section  12.4). Other co-benefits 
include lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, 
and reducing mortality from diet-related non-communicable diseases 
(Toumpanakis et al. 2018; Satija and Hu 2018; Faber et al. 2020; 
Magkos et al. 2020). However, transition towards sustainable healthy 
diets could have adverse impacts on the economic stability of the 
agricultural sector (MacDiarmid 2013; Aschemann-Witzel 2015; 
Van Loo et al. 2017). Therefore, shifting toward sustainable and 
healthy diets requires effective food-system oriented reform policies 
that integrate agriculture, health, and environment policies  to 
comprehensively address synergies and conflicts in co-lateral sectors 
(agriculture, trade, health, environment protection etc.) and capture 
spill-over effects, for example, climate change, biodiversity loss, food 
poverty (FAO and WHO 2019; Galli et al. 2020).
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC 
and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. According 
to the AR5, changes in human diets and consumption patterns can 
reduce emissions 5.3 to 20.2 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 by 2050 from diverted 
agricultural production and avoided land-use change (Smith et al. 
2014). In the SRCCL, a ‘contract and converge’ model of transition 
to sustainable healthy diets was suggested as an effective approach, 
reducing food consumption in over-consuming populations and 
increasing consumption of some food groups in populations where 
minimum nutritional needs are not met (P . Smith et al. 2019a). The 
total technical mitigation potential of changes in human diets was 
estimated as 0.7–8 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 by 2050 (Tilman and Clark 2014; 
Springmann et al. 2016; Hawken 2017) (SRCCL, Chapter 2 and 6), 
ranging from a 50% adoption of healthy diets (<60g of animal-based 
protein) and only accounting for diverted agricultural production, to 
the global adoption of a vegetarian diet.
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, 
SROCC and SRCCL). Since the SRCCL, global studies continue to 
find high mitigation potential from reducing animal-source foods 
and increasing proportions of plant-rich foods in diets. Springmann 
et al. (2018) estimated that diet changes in line with global dietary 
guidelines for total energy intake and consumption of red meat, 
sugar, fruits, and vegetables, could reduce GHG emissions by 29% 
and other environmental impacts by 5–9% compared with the 
baseline in 2050. Poore and Nemecek (2018) revealed that shifting 
towards diets that exclude animal-source food could reduce 
land use by 3.1 billion ha, decrease food-related GHG emissions 
by 6.5 GtCO 2-eq yr–1, acidification by 50%, eutrophication by 
49%, and freshwater withdrawals by 19% for a  2010 reference 
year. Frank et al. (2019) estimated non-CO 2 emissions reductions 
of 0.4 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 at a  carbon price of USD100 tCO 2–1 and 
0.6 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 at USD20 tCO 2–1 in 2050 from shifting to lower 
animal-source diets (430 kcal of livestock calorie intake) in developed 
and emerging countries. From a systematic literature review, Ivanova 
et al. (2020) found mitigation potentials of 0.4–2.1 tCO 2-eq capita–1 for a vegan diet, of 0.01–1.5 for a vegetarian diet, and of 0.1–2.0 for 
Mediterranean or similar healthy diet.
Regionally, mitigation potentials for shifting towards sustainable 
healthy diets (50% convergence to <60g of meat-based protein, 
only accounting for diverted production) vary across regions. 
A recent assessment finds greatest economic (up to USD100 tCO 2–1) 
potential for 2020–2050 in Asia and the Pacific (609 MtCO 2-eq yr–1) 
followed by Developed Countries (322 MtCO 2-eq yr–1) based on 
IPCC AR4 GWP100  values for CH 4 and N 2O) (Roe et al. 2021). In the 
EU, (Latka et al. 2021) found that moving to healthy diets through 
price incentives could bring about annual reductions of non-CO 2 
emissions from agriculture of 12–111 MtCO 2-eq yr–1. At the country 
level, recent studies show that following National Dietary Guidelines 
(NDG) would reduce food system GHG emissions by 4–42%, confer 
large health gains (1.0–1.5 million quality-adjusted life-years) and 
lower health care system costs (NZD 14–20 billion) in New Zealand 
Drew et al. (2020); reduce 28% of GHG emissions in Argentina 
Arrieta and González (2018); about 25% in Portugal Esteve-Llorens 
et al. (2020) and reduce GHG emissions, land use and blue water 
footprint by 15–60% in Spain (Batlle-Bayer et al. 2020). In contrast, 
Aleksandrowicz et al. (2019) found that meeting healthy dietary 
guidelines in India required increased dietary energy intake overall, 
which slightly increased environmental footprints by about 3–5% 
across GHG emissions, blue and green water footprints and land use.
Critical assessment and conclusion. Shifting to sustainable healthy 
diets has large potential to achieve global GHG mitigation targets as 
well as public health and environmental benefits (high confidence). 
Based on studies to date, there is medium confidence that shifting 
toward sustainable healthy diets has a technical potential including 
savings in the full value chain of 3.6 (0.3–8.0) GtCO 2-eq yr–1 of 
which 2.5 (1.5–3.9) GtCO 2-eq yr–1 is considered plausible based 
on a range of GWP100  values for CH 4 and N 2O. When accounting 
for diverted agricultural production only, the feasible potential is 
1.7 (1–2.7) GtCO 2-eq yr–1. A shift to more sustainable and healthy 
diets is generally feasible in many regions (medium confidence). 
However, potential varies across regions as diets are location- and 
community- specific, and thus may be influenced by local production 
practices, technical and financial barriers and associated livelihoods, 
everyday life and behavioural and cultural norms around food 
consumption (Meybeck and Gitz 2017; Creutzig et al. 2018; FAO 
2018b). Therefore, a  transition towards low-GHG emission diets 
and achieving their mitigation potential requires a  combination 
of appropriate policies, financial and non-financial incentives and 
awareness-raising campaigns to induce changes in consumer 
behaviour with potential synergies between climate objectives, 
health and equity (Rust et al. 2020).
7.4.5.2 Reduce Food Loss and Waste
Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities 
and barriers. Food loss and waste (FLW) refer to the edible parts 
of plants and animals produced for human consumption that are 
not ultimately consumed (UNEP 2021b). Food loss occurs through 
spoilage, spilling or other unintended consequences due to limitations 
in agricultural infrastructure, storage and packaging (Parfitt et al. 
and food service) and consumption stages in the food supply chain 
and refers to food appropriate for human consumption that is 
discarded or left to spoil (HLPE 2014). Options that could reduce FLW 
include: investing in harvesting and post-harvesting technologies in 
developing countries, taxing and other incentives to reduce business 
and consumer-level waste in developed countries, mandatory FLW 
reporting and reduction targets for large food businesses, regulation 
of unfair trading practices, and active marketing of cosmetically 
imperfect products (van Giesen and de Hooge 2019; Sinclair Taylor 
et al. 2019). Other studies suggested providing options of longer-
lasting products and behavioural changes (e.g., through information 
provision) that cause dietary and consumption changes and motivate 
consumers to actively make decisions that reduce FLW. Reductions 
of FLW along the food chain bring a range of benefits beyond GHG 
mitigation, including reducing environmental stress (e.g., water and 
land competition, land degradation, desertification), safeguarding 
food security, and reducing poverty (Galford et al. 2020; 
Venkatramanan et al. 2020). Additionally, FLW reduction is crucial for 
achieving SDG 12 which calls for ensuring ‘sustainable consumption 
and production patterns’ through lowering per capita global food 
waste by 50% at the retail and consumer level and reducing food 
losses along food supply chains by 2030. In line with these SDG 
targets, it is estimated that reducing FLW can free up several million 
km2 of land (high confidence). The interlinkages between reducing 
FLW and food system sustainability are discussed in Chapter  12. 
Recent literature identifies a  range of barriers to climate change 
mitigation through FLW reduction, which are linked to technological, 
biophysical, socio-economic, financial and cultural contexts at 
regional and local levels (Vogel and Meyer 2018; Gromko and 
Abdurasalova 2019; Rogissart et al. 2019; Blok et al. 2020). Examples 
of these barriers include infrastructural and capacity limitations, 
institutional regulations, financial resources, constraining resources 
(e.g., energy), information gaps (e.g., with retailers), and consumers’ 
behaviour (Gromko and Abdurasalova 2019; Blok et al. 2020).
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC 
and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. In AR5, 
reduced FLW was considered as a  mitigation measure that could 
substantially lower emissions, with estimated mitigation potential of 
0.6–6.0 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 in the food supply chain (Smith et al. 2014). 
In the SRCCL, the technical mitigation potential of reducing food 
and agricultural waste was estimated at 0.76–4.5 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 
(Bajželj et al. 2014; Dickie et al. 2014b; Hawken 2017) (SRCCL, 
Chapter 2 and 6).
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, 
SROCC and SRCCL). Since the SRCCL, there have been very few 
quantitative estimates of the mitigation potential of FLW reductions. 
Evidence suggests that reducing FLW together with overall food 
intake could have substantial mitigation potential, equating to an 
average of 0.3 tCO 2-eq capita–1 (Ivanova et al. 2020). Some regional 
sectoral studies indicate that reducing FLW in the EU can reduce 
emissions by 186 MtCO 2-eq yr–1, the equivalent of around 15% of the 
environmental impacts (climate, acidification, and eutrophication) 
of the entire food value chain (Scherhaufer et al. 2018). In the UK, 
disruptive low-carbon innovations relating to FLW reduction were found to be associated with potential emissions reductions ranging 
between 2.6 and 3.6 MtCO 2-eq (Wilson et al. 2019). Other studies 
investigated the effect of tax mechanisms, such as ‘pay as you 
throw’ for household waste, on the mitigation potential of reducing 
FLW.  Generally, these mechanisms are recognised as particularly 
effective in reducing the amount of waste and increasing the 
recycling rate of households (Carattini et al. 2018; Rogissart et al. 
2019). Technological FWL mitigation opportunities exist throughout 
the food supply chain; post-harvest opportunities for FLW reductions 
are discussed in Chapter  12. Based on IPCC AR4 GWP100  values 
for CH 4 and N 2O, greatest economic mitigation potential (up to 
USD100 tCO 2–1) for the period 2020–2050 from FLW reduction is 
estimated to be in Asia and Pacific (192.3 GtCO 2-eq yr–1) followed by 
Developed Countries (101.6 GtCO 2-eq yr–1) (Roe et al. 2021). These 
estimates reflect diverted agricultural production and do not capture 
potential from avoided land-use changes.
Critical assessment and conclusion. There is medium confidence 
that reduced FLW has large global technical mitigation potential 
of 2.1 (0.1–5.8) GtCO 2-eq yr–1 including savings in the full value 
chain and using GWP100  and a range of IPCC values for CH 4 and 
N2O.  Potentials at 3.7 (2.2–5.1) GtCO 2-eq yr–1 are considered 
plausible. When accounting for diverted agricultural production only, 
the feasible potential is 0.5 (0.0–0.9) GtCO 2-eq yr–1. See the section 
above for the joint land-use effects of food related demand-side 
measures which increases three-fold when accounting for the land-
use effects as well. But this would overlap with other measures and is 
therefore not additive. Regionally, FLW reduction is feasible anywhere 
but its potential needs to be understood in a wider and changing 
socio-cultural context that determines nutrition (high confidence).
7.4.5.3 Improved and Enhanced Use of Wood Products
Activities, co-benefits, risks and implementation opportunities 
and barriers. The use of wood products refers to the fate of 
harvested wood for material uses and includes two distinctly different 
components affecting the carbon cycle, including carbon storage in 
wood products and material substitution. When harvested wood is 
used for the manufacture of wood products, carbon remains stored 
in these products depending on their end use and lifetime. Carbon 
storage in wood products can be increased through enhancing 
the inflow of products in use, or effectively reducing the outflow 
of the products after use. This can be achieved through additional 
harvest under sustainable management (Pilli et al. 2015; Johnston 
and Radeloff 2019), changing the allocation of harvested wood to 
long-lived wood products or by increasing products’ lifetime and 
increasing recycling (Brunet-Navarro et al. 2017; Jasinevičius et al. 
2017; Xu et al. 2018; Xie et al. 2021). Material substitution involves 
the use of wood for building, textiles, or other applications instead 
of other materials (e.g.,  concrete or steel, which consume more 
energy to produce) to avoid or reduce emissions associated with the 
production, use and disposal of those products it replaces.
The benefits and risks of improved and enhanced improved use of 
wood products are closely linked to forest management. First of all, 
the enhanced use of wood products could potentially activate or 
lead to improved sustainable forest management that can mitigate 
products and the potential for substitution effects can be increased 
by additional harvest, but with the risk of decreasing carbon storage 
in forest biomass when not done sustainably (P . Smith et al. 2019a). 
Conversely, reduced harvest may lead to gains in carbon storage 
in forest ecosystems locally, but these gains may be offset through 
international trade of forest products causing increased harvesting 
pressure or even degradation elsewhere (Kastner et al. 2011; Kallio 
et al. 2018; Pendrill et al. 2019b). There are also environmental 
impacts associated with the processing, manufacturing, use and 
disposal of wood products (Adhikari and Ozarska 2018; Baumgartner 
2019). See Section 9.6.4 of this report for additional discussion on 
benefits and risks.
Conclusions from AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, SROCC 
and SRCCL); mitigation potential, costs, and pathways. There 
is strong evidence at the product level that wood products from 
sustainably managed forests are associated with less greenhouse 
emissions in their production, use and disposal over their life-time 
compared to products made from emission-intensive and non-
renewable materials. However, there is still limited understanding of 
the substitution effects at the level of markets, countries (Leskinen 
et al. 2018). The AR5 did not report on the mitigation potential of 
wood products. The SRCCL (Chapters 2 and 6) finds that some studies 
indicate significant mitigation potentials for material substitution, 
but concludes that the global, technical mitigation potential for 
material substitution for construction applications ranges from 
0.25–1 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 (medium confidence) (Miner 2010; McLaren 
2012; Roe et al. 2019).
Developments since AR5 and IPCC Special Reports (SR1.5, 
SROCC and SRCCL). Since the SRCCL, several studies have 
examined the mitigation potential of the enhanced and improved use 
of wood products. A global forest sector modelling study (Johnston 
and Radeloff 2019) estimated that carbon storage in wood products 
represented a  net carbon stock increase of 0.34 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 
globally in 2015 and which could provide an average mitigation 
potential (by increasing the HWP pool) of 0.33–0.41 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 
for the period 2020–2050, based on the future socio-economic 
development (SSP scenarios) and its effect on the production and 
consumption of wood products. Traded feedstock provided another 
0.071 GtCO 2 yr–1 of carbon storage in 2015 and 0.12 GtCO 2 yr–1 
by 2065. These potentials exclude the effect of material substitution. 
Another recent study estimated the global mitigation potential of 
mid-rise urban buildings designed with engineered wood products 
at 0.04–3.7 GtCO 2 yr–1 (Churkina et al. 2020). Another study (Oliver 
et al. 2014) estimated that using wood to substitute for concrete 
and steel as building materials could provide a technical mitigation 
potential of 0.78–1.73 GtCO 2 yr–1 achieved through carbon storage 
in wood products and through material and energy substitution.
The limited availability or absence of estimates of the future mitigation 
potential of improved use of wood products for many world regions 
represents an important knowledge gap, especially with regards to 
material substitution effects. At the product level, wood products are 
often associated with lower fossil-based emissions from production, 
use and disposal, compared to products made from emission-intensive and non-renewable materials (Sathre and O’Connor 2010; 
Geng et al. 2017; Leskinen et al. 2018).
Critical assessment and conclusion. Based on studies to 
date, there is strong evidence and medium agreement that 
the improved use of wood products has a  technical potential 
of 1.0 (0.04–3.7) GtCO 2-eq yr–1 and economic potential of 
0.4  (0.3–0.5) GtCO 2-eq yr–1. There is strong evidence and high 
agreement at the product level that material substitution provides 
on average benefits for climate change mitigation as wood products 
are associated with less fossil-based GHG emissions over their 
lifetime compared to products made from emission-intensive and 
non-renewable materials. However, the evidence at the level of 
markets or countries is uncertain and fairly limited for many parts 
of the world. There is medium confidence that material substitution 
and carbon storage in wood products contribute to climate change 
mitigation when also the carbon balances of forest ecosystems are 
considered of sustainably managed large areas of forests in medium 
term. The total future mitigation potential will depend on the forest 
system considered, the type of wood products that are produced and 
substituted and the assumed production technologies and conversion 
efficiencies of these products.
7.5 AFOLU Integrated Models and Scenarios
This section assesses the literature and data available on potential 
future GHG dynamics in the AFOLU sector, the cost-effectiveness of 
different mitigation measures, and consequences of climate change 
mitigation pathways on land-use dynamics as well as relevant 
sustainable development indicators at the regional and global level 
based on global integrated models.
Land-based mitigation options interact and create various trade-
offs, and thus need to be assessed together as well as with 
mitigation options in other sectors, and in combination with other 
sustainability goals (Popp et al. 2014; Obersteiner et al. 2016; 
Roe et al. 2019; Van Vuuren et al. 2019; Prudhomme et al. 2020; 
Strefler et al. 2021). The assessments of individual mitigation 
measures or sectoral estimates used to estimate mitigation 
potential in Section 7.4, when aggregated together, do not account 
for interactions and trade-offs. Integrative land-use models (ILMs) 
combine different land-based mitigation options and are partially 
included in Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) which combine 
insights from various disciplines in a single framework and cover 
the largest sources of anthropogenic GHG emissions from different 
sectors. Over time, ILMs and IAMs have extended their system 
coverage (Johnson et al. 2019). However, the explicit modelling 
and analysis of integrated land-use systems is relatively new 
compared to other sectoral assessments such as the energy system 
(Jia et al. 2019). Consequently, ILMs as well as IAMs differ in their 
portfolio and representation of land-based mitigation options, the 
representation of sustainability goals other than climate action as 
well as the interplay with mitigation in other sectors (van Soest 
et al. 2019; Johnson et al. 2019). These structural differences have 
implications for the regional and global deployment of different 
mitigation options as well as their sustainability impacts.
assessment in ILMs and IAMs, the portfolio of land-based mitigation 
options does not cover the full option space as outlined in Section 7.4. 
The inclusion and detail of a  specific mitigation measure differs 
across models. Land-based mitigation options are only partially 
included in ILM and IAM analyses, which mostly rely on afforestation/
reforestation and bioenergy with CCS (BECCS). Most ILM and IAM 
scenarios are based on the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) 
(Riahi et al. 2017), which is a  set of contrasting future scenarios 
widely used in the research community such as in the CMIP6 exercise, 
the SRCCL and the IPBES global assessment. However, the coverage 
of land-based mitigation options in these scenarios is mostly limited 
to dietary changes, higher efficiency in food processing (especially 
in livestock production systems), reduction of food waste, increasing 
agricultural productivity, methane reductions in rice paddies, 
livestock and grazing management for reduced methane emissions 
from enteric fermentation, manure management, improvement of 
N-efficiency, international trade, first generation of biofuels, avoided 
deforestation, afforestation, bioenergy and BECCS (Popp et al. 2017; 
Van Meijl et al. 2018; Frank et al. 2019). Hence, there are mitigation 
options not being broadly included in integrated pathway modelling 
as soil carbon, forest management, agroforestry or wetland management (Humpenöder et al. 2020) which have the potential to 
alter the contribution of land-based mitigation in terms of timing, 
potential and sustainability consequences (Frank et al. 2017).
7.5.1 Regional GHG Emissions and Land Dynamics
In most of the assessed mitigation pathways, the AFOLU sector is 
of great importance for climate change mitigation as it (i) turns 
from a  source into a  sink of atmospheric CO 2 due to large-scale 
afforestation and reforestation, (ii) provides high amounts of biomass 
for bioenergy with or without CCS and (iii), even under improved 
agricultural management, still causes residual non-CO 2 emissions 
from agricultural production and (iv) interplays with sustainability 
dimensions other than climate action (Popp et al. 2017; Rogelj 
et al. 2017; Van Vuuren et al. 2018; Frank et al. 2018; Hasegawa 
et al. 2018; van Soest et al. 2019). Regional AFOLU GHG emissions 
in scenarios with <4°C warming in 2100 (scenario category C7), 
as shown in Figure  7.13, are shaped by considerable CH 4 and 
N2O emissions throughout 2050 and 2100, mainly from ASIA and 
AFRICA. CH 4 emissions from enteric fermentation are largely caused 
by ASIA, followed by AFRICA, while CH 4 emissions from paddy rice

C2), <2°C (C3, C4), <3°C (C5, C6) and <4°C (C7) global warming in 2100 (scenario type is indicated by colour). The categories shown include CH 4 emissions 
from enteric fermentation (EntF) and rice production (Rice), N 2O emissions from animal waste management (AWM) and fertilisation (Soil). The category CO 2 Land includes CO 2 
emissions from land-use change as well as removals due to afforestation/reforestation. BECCS reflects the CO 2 emissions captured from bioenergy use and stored in geological 
deposits. The annual GHG emission data from various models and scenarios is converted to CO 2 equivalents using GWP factors of 27 for CH 4 and 273 for N 2O. The data is 
summarised in boxplots (Tukey style), which show the median (vertical line), the interquartile range (IQR box) and the range of values within 1.5 × interquartile range at either 
end of the box (horizontal lines) across all models and scenarios. The number of data points available for each emission category, scenario type, region and year is shown at the 
edge of each panel. Regional definitions: AFRICA = sub-Saharan Africa, ASIA = Asia, LAM = Latin America and Caribbean, MID_EAST = Middle East, OECD90+EU = OECD 90

from animal waste management and soils are more equally 
distributed across region.
In most regions, CH 4 and N 2O emission are both lower in mitigation 
pathways that limit warming to 3°C (>50%) or lower (C1–C6) 
compared to scenarios with <4°C (Popp et al. 2017; Rogelj et al. 
2018a). In particular, the reduction of CH 4 emissions from enteric 
fermentation in ASIA and AFRICA is profound. Land-related CO 2 
emissions, which include emissions from deforestation as well 
as removals from afforestation, are slightly negative (i.e., AFOLU 
systems turn into a  sink) in <1.5°C, <2°C and <3°C mitigation 
pathways compared to <4°C scenarios. Carbon sequestration via 
BECCS is most prominent in ASIA, LAM, AFRICA and OECD90+EU, 
which are also the regions with the highest bioenergy area.
Figure 7.14 indicates that regional land-use dynamics in scenarios with 
<4°C warming in 2100 are characterised by rather static agricultural 
land (i.e., cropland and pasture) in ASIA, LAM, OECD90+EU and 
REF , and increasing agricultural land in AFRICA.  Bioenergy area is 
relatively small in all regions. Agricultural land in AFRICA expands at 
the cost of forests and other natural land.The overall land dynamics in <1.5°C, <2°C and <3°C mitigation 
pathways are shaped by land-demanding mitigation options such 
as bioenergy and afforestation, in addition to the demand for other 
agricultural and forest commodities. Bioenergy production and 
afforestation take place largely in the (partly) tropical regions ASIA, 
LAM and AFRICA, but also in OECD90+EU. Land for dedicated second 
generation bioenergy crops and afforestation displace agricultural 
land for food production (cropland and pasture) and other natural 
land. For instance, in the <1.5°C mitigation pathway in ASIA, 
bioenergy and forest area together increased by about 2.1 million km2 
between 2020 and 2100, mostly at the cost of cropland and pasture 
(median values). Such large-scale transformations of land use have 
repercussions on biogeochemical cycles (e.g.,  fertiliser and water) 
but also on the economy (e.g.,  food prices) and potential socio-
political conditions.
7.5.2 Marginal Abatement Costs According 
to Integrated Assessments
In this section, Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) results from the 
AR6 database are used to derive marginal abatement costs which 
indicate the economic mitigation potential for the different gases 
(N2O, CH 4, CO 2) related to the AFOLU sector, at the global level and at <1.5°C <2°C <3°C <4°C

view on the economic mitigation potentials estimated in Section 7.4 
by implicitly taking into account the interlinkages between the land-
based mitigation options themselves as well as the interlinkages with 
mitigation options in the other sectors such as BECCS. The review 
systematically evaluates a  range of possible economic potential 
estimates across gases, time, and carbon prices.
For different models and scenarios from the AR6 database, 
the amount of mitigated emissions is presented together with the 
respective carbon price (Figure  7.15). To determine mitigation 

more than 10% from the reported global total. To take into account that small absolute values have a higher sensitivity, a deviation of 90% is allowed for absolute 
values below 100.potentials, scenarios are compared to a benchmark scenario which 
usually assumes business-as-usual trends and no explicit additional 
mitigation efforts. Scenarios have been excluded, if they do not have 
an associated benchmark scenario or fail the vetting according to the 
AR6 scenario database, or if they do not report carbon prices and CO 2 
emissions from AFOLU. Scenarios with contradicting assumptions (for 
example, fixing some of the emissions to baseline levels) are excluded. 
Furthermore, only scenarios with consistent3 regional and global 
level results are considered. Mitigation potentials are computed by 
subtracting scenario specific emissions and sequestration amounts 
from their respective benchmark scenario values. This difference −2000

scenario, and mapping these differences with the respective carbon price difference. Plots only show the price range of up to 250 USD2010 tCO 2-eq–1 and the mitigation range

within the boxes), means (dots), 33%–66% intervals (box) and 10%–90% intervals (horizontal lines). Numbers on the very right indicate the number of observations falling 
into the respective price range per variable. A wide range of carbon price induced mitigation options (such as technical, structural and behavioural options in the agricultural 
sector, afforestation, reforestation, natural re-growth or avoided deforestation in the LULUCF sector, excluding carbon capture and sequestration from BECCS) are reflected in 
different scenarios.
which is applied in a scenario. A few benchmark scenarios, however, 
apply already low carbon prices. For consistency reasons, a carbon 
price that is applied in a benchmark scenario is subtracted from the 
respective scenario specific carbon price. This may generate a bias 
because low carbon prices tend to have a stronger marginal impact 
on mitigation than high carbon prices. Scenarios with carbon prices 
which become negative due to the correction are not considered. The 
analysis considers all scenarios from the AR6 database which pass 
the criteria and should be considered as an ensemble of opportunity 
(Huppmann et al. 2018).
This approach is close to integrated assessment marginal abatement 
cost curves (MACCs) as described in the literature (Fujimori et al. 
2016; Frank et al. 2018, 2019; Harmsen et al. 2019) in the sense 
that it incorporates besides the technical mitigation options also 
structural options, as well as behavioural changes and market 
feedbacks. Furthermore, indirect emission changes and interactions 
with other sectors can be highly relevant (Daioglou et al. 2019; Kalt 
et al. 2020) and are also accounted for in the presented potentials. 
Hereby, some sequestration efforts can occur in other sectors, while 
leading to less mitigation in the AFOLU sector. For instance, as an 
integral part of many scenarios, BECCS deployment will lead to 
overall emissions reductions, and even provision of CDR as a result of 
the interplay between three direct components (i) LULUCF emissions/
sinks, (ii) reduction of fossil fuel use/emissions, (iii) carbon capture 
and sequestration. Since the latter two effects can compensate for 
the LULUCF effect, BECCS deployment in ambitious stabilisation 
scenarios may lead to reduced sink/increased emissions in LULUCF 
(Kalt et al. 2020). The same holds for trade-offs between carbon 
sequestration in forests versus harvested wood products both for 
enhancing the HWP pool and for material substitution. The strengths 
of the competition between biomass use and carbon sequestration 
will depend on the biomass feedstocks considered (Lauri et al. 2019).
In the individual cases, the accounting of all these effects is 
dependent on the respective underlying model and its coverage of 
inter-relations of different sectors and sub-sectors. The presented 
potentials cover a  wide range of models, and additionally, a  wide 
range of background assumptions on macro-economic, technical, 
and behavioural developments as well as policies, which the models 
have been fed with. Subsequently, the range of the resulting marginal 
abatement costs is relatively wide, showing the full range of expected 
contributions from land-use sector mitigation and sequestration in 
applied mitigation pathways.
At the global level, the analysis of the economic mitigation potentials 
from N 2O and CH 4 emissions from AFOLU (which mainly can be related 
to agricultural activities) and CO 2 emissions (which mainly can be 
related to LULUCF emissions) reveals a relatively good agreement of 
models and scenarios in terms of ranking between the gases. On the 
right-hand side panels of Figure 7.15, only small overlaps between 
the ranges (showing the 10–90% intervals of observations) and 
mainly for lower price levels, can be observed, despite all differences 
in underlying model structure and scenario assumptions.N2O emissions show the smallest economic potential of the 
three different gases in 2030 as well as in 2050. The mitigation 
potential increases until a  price range of USD150–200 and to 
a median value of around 0.6 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 mitigation in 2030 and 
0.9 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 in 2050, respectively, while afterwards with higher 
prices the expansion is very limited. Mitigation of CH 4 emissions has 
a  higher potential, also with increasing mitigation potentials until 
a price range of USD150–200 in both years, with median mitigation 
of around 1.3 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 in 2030 and around 2.4 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 
in 2050, respectively. The highest mitigation potentials are observed 
for CO 2, but also the highest ranges of observations among the three 
gases. In 2030, a median of 4 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 mitigation potential is 
reported for the price range of USD200–250. In 2050, for the carbon 
price range of between USD100 and USD200, a median of around 
4.8 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 can be observed.
When compared with the sectoral estimates from Harmsen et al. 
(2019), the integrated assessment median potentials are broadly 
comparable for the N 2O mitigation potential; Harmsen et al. 

the integrated assessment estimate for the same price range is 
0.7 GtCO 2-eq yr–1. The difference is substantially larger for the CH 4 
mitigation potential; 0.9 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 in Harmsen et al. while 

the Harmsen et al. MACCs consider only technological mitigation 
options, integrated assessments typically include also demand side 
response to the carbon price and GHG efficiency improvements 
through structural change and international trade. These additional 
mitigation options can represent more than 60% of the total non-CO 2 
mitigation potential in the agricultural sector, where they are more 
important in the livestock sector, and thus the difference between 
sectoral and integrated assessments is more pronounced for the CH 4 
emissions (Frank et al. 2019).
Economic CO 2 mitigation potentials from land-use change and forestry 
are larger compared to potentials from non-CO 2 gases, and at the 
same time reveal high levels of variation in absolute terms. The 66th 
percentile in 2050 goes up to 5.2 GtCO 2-eq yr–1 mitigation, while 
the lowest observations are even negative, indicating higher CO 2 
emissions from land use in scenarios with carbon price compared to 
scenarios without (counterintuitive dynamics explained below).
Land use is at the centre of the interdependencies with other sectors, 
including energy. Some models see a  strong competition between 
BECCS deployment with its respective demand for biomass, and 
CO2 mitigation/sequestration potentials in the land sector. Biomass 
demand may lead to an increase in CO 2 emissions from land use 
despite the application of a carbon price when land-use expansion 
for dedicated biomass production, such as energy plantations, comes 
from carbon rich land use/land cover alternatives, or when increased 
extraction of biomass from existing land uses, such as forest 
management, leads to reduction of the carbon sink (Daioglou 2019; 
Luderer et al. 2018) and can explain the high variety of observations 
in some cases. Overall, the large variety of observations shows a large 
variety of plausible results, which can go back to different model 
structures and assumptions, showing a  robust range of plausible 
outcomes (Kriegler et al. 2015).
Sector and Other SDGs in the Context of 
Integrated Assessments
Besides the level of biomass supply for bioenergy, the adoption of 
SDGs may also significantly impact AFOLU emissions and the land-
use sector’s ability for GHG abatement (Frank et al. 2021). Selected 
SDGs are found to have positive synergies for AFOLU GHG abatement 
and to consistently decrease GHG emissions for both agriculture and 
forestry, thereby allowing for even more rapid and deeper emissions 
cuts. In particular, the decreased consumption of animal products 
and less food waste (SDG 12), and the protection of high biodiversity 
ecosystems such as primary forests (SDG 15) deliver high synergies 
with GHG abatement. On the other hand, protection of highly 
biodiverse ecosystems from conversion (SDG 15) limits the global 
biomass potentials for bioenergy (Frank et al. 2021), and while several forestry measures enhancing woody biomass supply for bioenergy may 
have synergies with improving ecosystems conditions, many represent 
a threat to biodiversity (Camia et al. 2020) (Sections 7.6.5 and 17.3.3.7, 
Figure 17.1 and Supplementary Material Table 17.SM.1).
7.5.4 Regional AFOLU Abatement 
for Different Carbon Prices
At the regional level (Figure 7.16), the highest potential from non-CO 2 
emissions abatement, and mostly from CH 4, is reported for ASIA with 
the median of mitigation potential observations from CH 4 increasing 
up to a  price of USD200 in the year 2050, reaching a  median of 
1.2 GtCO 2-eq yr–1. In terms of economic potential, ASIA is followed 
by LAM, AFRICA, and OECD+EU, where emission reduction mainly is 
achieved in the livestock sector.

avoided deforestation as well as afforestation, can be observed in 
LAM and AFRICA with strong responses of mitigation (indicated 
by the median value) to carbon prices mainly in the lower range 
of displayed carbon prices. In general, CO 2 mitigation potentials 
show a wide range of results in comparison to non-CO 2 mitigation 
potentials, but mostly also a higher median value. The most extreme 
ranges are reported for the regions LAM and AFRICA. A medium 
potential is reported for ASIA and OECD+EU, while REF has the 
smallest potential according to model submissions. These estimates 
reflect techno-economic potentials and do not necessarily include 
feasibility constraints which are discussed in Chapter 7.6.7.5.5 Illustrative Mitigation Pathways
Different mitigation strategies can achieve the net emission reductions 
that would be required to follow a pathway limiting global warming, 
with very different consequences for the land system. Figure  7.17 
shows Illustrative Mitigation Pathways (IMPs) for achieving different 
climate targets highlighting AFOLU mitigation strategies, resulting 
GHG and land-use dynamics as well as the interaction with other 
sectors. For consistency this chapter discusses IMPs as described in 
detail in chapters 1 and 3 of this report but focusing on the land-use 
sector. All pathways are assessed by different IAM realisations and do 
not only reduce GHG emissions but also use CDR options, whereas GtCO2-eq yr–1 106 km2CO2|AFOLU N2O|AFOLU BECCS CH4|AFOLUEmission typea. Global land-based GHG emissions and removals

Mitigation Pathways, which illustrate the differences in timing and magnitude of land-based mitigation approaches including afforestation and 
BECCS.  All pathways are based on different IAM realisations: ModAct scenario (below 3.0°C, C6) from IMAGE 3.0; IMP Neg-2.0 (limit warming to 2°C (>67%), C3) from AIM/
CGE 2.2; IMP Ren (1.5°C with no or low overshoot, C1) from REMIND-MAgPIE 2.1–4.3; IMP SP (1.5°C with no or low overshoot, C1) from REMIND-MAgPIE 2.1–4.2. In panel 
A the categories CO 2 AFOLU, CH 4 AFOLU and N 2O AFOLU include GHG emissions from land-use change and agricultural land use (including emissions related to bioenergy 
production). In addition, the category CO 2 Land includes removals due to afforestation/reforestation. BECCS reflects the CO 2 emissions captured from bioenergy use and stored 
in geological deposits. CH 4 and N 2O emissions are converted to CO 2-eq using GWP100 factors of 27 and 273 respectively.
contributions of different land-based CDR options.
The scenario ModAct (limit warming to 3°C (>50%), C6) is based on 
the prolongation of current trends (SSP2) but contains measures to 
strengthen policies for the implementation of National Determined 
Contributions (NDCs) in all sectors including AFOLU (Grassi et al. 
2018). This pathway shows a strong decrease of CO 2 emissions from 
land-use change in 2030, mainly due to reduced deforestation, as well 
as moderately decreasing N 2O and CH 4 emissions from agricultural 
production due to improved agricultural management and dietary 
shifts away from emissions-intensive livestock products. However, 
in contrast to CO 2 emissions, which turn net-negative around 2050 
due to afforestation/reforestation, CH 4 and N 2O emissions persist 
throughout the century due to difficulties of eliminating these 
residual emissions based on existing agricultural management 
methods (Frank et al. 2017; Stevanović et al. 2017). Comparably small 
amounts of BECCS are applied by the end of the century. Forest area 
increases at the cost of other natural vegetation.
IMP-Neg is similar to ModAct scenario in terms of socio-economic 
setting (SSP2) but differs strongly in terms of the mitigation target 
(limit warming to 2°C (>67%), C3) and its strong focus on the supply 
side of mitigation measures with strong reliance on net-negative 
emissions. Consequently, all GHG emission reductions as well as 
afforestation/reforestation and BECCS-based CDR start earlier in 
time at a  higher rate of deployment. However, in contrast to CO 2 
emissions, which turn net-negative around 2030 due to afforestation/
reforestation, CH 4 and N 2O emissions persist throughout the century, 
similar to ModAct, due to ongoing increasing demand for total 
calories and animal-based commodities (Bodirsky et al. 2020) and 
difficulties of eliminating these residual emissions based on existing 
agricultural management methods (Stevanović et al. 2017; Frank 
et al. 2017). In addition to abating land-related GHG emissions 
as well as increasing the terrestrial sink, this example also shows 
the potential importance of the land sector in providing biomass 
for BECCS and hence CDR in the energy sector. Cumulative CDR 
(2020–2100) amounts to 502 GtCO 2 for BECCS and 121 GtCO 2 for 
land-use change (including afforestation and reduced deforestation). 
In consequence, compared to ModAct scenario, competition for 
land is increasing and much more other natural land as well as 
agricultural land (cropland and pasture land) is converted to forest or 
bioenergy cropland with potentially severe consequences for various 
sustainability dimensions such as biodiversity (Hof et al. 2018) and 
food security (Fujimori et al. 2019).
IMP-Ren is similar to IMP Neg-2.0 in terms of socio-economic 
setting (SSP2) but differs substantially in terms of mitigation target 
and mitigation efforts in the energy sector. Even under the more 
ambitious climate change mitigation target (1.5°C with no or low 
overshoot (OS), C1), the high share of renewable energy in IMP Ren 
strongly reduces the need for large-scale land-based CDR, which is 
reflected in smaller bioenergy and afforestation areas compared to 
IMP Neg-2.0. However, CH 4 and N 2O emissions from AFOLU persist 
throughout the century, similar to ModAct scenario and IMP Neg-2.0.In contrast to IMPs Neg-2.0 and Ren, IMP SP (Soergel et al. 2021; 1.5°C 
with no or low OS, C1) displays a future of generally low resource and 
energy consumption (including healthy diets with low animal-calorie 
shares and low food waste) as well as significant but sustainable 
agricultural intensification in combination with high levels of 
nature protection. This pathway shows a strong near-term decrease 
of CO 2 emissions from land-use change, mainly due to reduced 
deforestation, and in difference to all other IMPs described in this 
chapter strongly decreasing N 2O and CH 4 emissions from agricultural 
production due to improved agricultural management but also based 
on dietary shifts away from emissions-intensive livestock products 
as well as lower shares of food waste. In consequence, comparably 
small amounts of land are needed for land demanding mitigation 
activities such as BECCS and afforestation. In particular, the amount 
of agricultural land converted to bioenergy cropland is smaller 
compared to other mitigation pathways. Forest area increases either 
by regrowth of secondary vegetation following the abandonment 
of agricultural land or by afforestation/reforestation at the cost of 
agricultural land.
7.6 Assessment of Economic, Social 
and Policy Responses
7.6.1 Retrospective in Policy Efforts and Achieved 
Mitigation Within AFOLU
Since the establishment of the UNFCCC, international agencies, 
countries, sub-national units and NGO’s have developed policies to 
facilitate and encourage GHG mitigation within AFOLU (Figure 7.18). 
Early guidance and policies focused on developing GHG inventory 
methodology with some emphasis on afforestation and reforestation 
projects, but the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) in the Kyoto 
Protocol focused attention on emission reduction projects, mostly 
outside of AFOLU. As successive IPCC AR6 WGIII reports illustrated 
large potential for AFOLU mitigation, methods to quantify and 
verify carbon emission reductions emerged within several projects 
in the early 2000s, through both voluntary (e.g.,  the Chicago 
Climate Exchange (CCX)) and regulated (e.g., New South Wales and 
California) markets. The CDM dedicated large attention to LULUCF , 
including dedicated methodologies and bodies. The reasons for 
limited uptake of CDM afforestation/reforestation projects were 
multiple and not limited to the regulatory constraints, but also due to 
the low abatement potential (poor cost/performance ratio) compared 
to other mitigation opportunities.
Following COP 13 in Bali, effort shifted to advancing policies to 
reduce deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) in developing 
countries. According to Simonet et al. (2019), nearly 65 Mha have 
been enrolled in REDD+ type programmes or projects funded 
through a variety of sources, including United Nations Programme 
on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation 
(UN-REDD), the World Bank Forest Carbon Partnership Facility, and 
bi-lateral agreements between countries with Norway being the 
largest donor. While there has been considerable focus on forest and 
were encouraged to incorporate project-based approaches with other 
sectoral strategies in their Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions 
(NAMAs) after 2012. NAMAs reflect the country’s proposed strategy 
to reduce net emissions across various sectors within their economy 
(e.g.,  forests or agriculture). More recently, Nationally Determined 
Contributions (NDCs) indicate whether individual countries plan to 
use forestry and agricultural policies or related projects amongst a set 
of measures in other sectors, to reduce their net emissions as part of 
the Paris Agreement (e.g., Forsell et al. 2016; Fyson and Jeffery 2019).
The many protocols now available can be used to quantify the 
potential mitigation to date resulting from various projects or 
programs. For instance, carbon registries issue credits using protocols 
that typically account for additionality, permanence and leakage, thus 
providing evidence that the projects are a net carbon benefit to the 
atmosphere. Protocol development engages the scientific community, 
project developers, and the public over a  multi-year period. Some 
protocols have been revised multiple times, such as the USA State of 
California’s forest carbon protocol, which is in its fifth revision, with 
the latest in 2019 (see http://www.climateactionreserve.org/how/
protocols/forest/). Credits from carbon registries feed into regulatory 
programs, such as the cap and trade programme in California, or voluntary offset markets (Hamrick and Gallant 2017a). Although 
AFOLU measures have been deployed across a range of projects and 
programmes globally to reduce net carbon emissions, debate about 
the net carbon benefits of some projects continues (e.g., Krug 2018).
A new assessment of projects over the last two decades finds 
emission reductions or offsets of at least 7.9 GtCO 2-eq (using 
GWP100  and a mix of IPCC values for CH 4 and N 2O) over the last 12 
years due to agricultural and forestry activities (Table 7.4). More than 
80% of these emission reductions or offsets have been generated 
by forest-based activities. The total amounts to 0.66 GtCO 2 yr–1 for 
the period 2010–2019, which is 1.2% of total global, and 5.5% of 
AFOLU emissions reported in Table 7.1, over the same time period 
(high confidence).
The array of activities in Table 7.4 includes the Clean Development 
Mechanism, REDD+ activities reported in technical annexes of 
country biennial update reports to the UNFCCC, voluntary market 
transactions, and carbon stored as a  result of carbon markets in 
Australia, New Zealand and California in the USA. Although other 
countries and sub-national units have developed programmes 
and policies, these three regions are presented due to their focus 
on forest and agricultural carbon mitigation, their use of generally 1992 1997 2007 2012 2015

quantify outcomes.
The largest share of emission reductions or carbon offsets in Table 7.4 
has been from slowing deforestation and REDD+, specifically 
from efforts in Brazil (86% of total), which substantially reduced 
deforestation rates between 2004 and 2012 (Nepstad et al. 2014), 
as well as other countries in Latin America. With the exception of 
Roopsind et al. (2019), estimated reductions in carbon emissions from 
REDD+ in Table 7.4 are measured relative to a historical baseline. As 
noted in Brazil’s Third Biennial Update Report (Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs 2019), estimates are made in accordance with established 
methodologies to determine the benefits of results-based REDD+ 
payments to Brazil. REDD+ estimates from other countries also have 
been derived from biennial update reports.
Regulatory markets provide the next largest share of carbon removal 
to date. Data from the Australia Emissions Reduction Fund are 
carbon credits issued in for agricultural, and vegetation and savanna 
burning projects. In the case of California, offset credits from forest 
and agricultural activities, using methods approved by a third-party 
certification authority (Climate Action Reserve), have been allowed as 
part of their state-wide cap and trade system. Transaction prices for 
forest and agricultural credits in California were around USD13 tCO 2–1 
in 2018, and represented 7.4% of total market compliance. By the 
end of 2018, 80 MtCO 2 had been used for compliance purposes.For New Zealand, the carbon reduction in Table 7.4 represents forest 
removals that were surrendered from post-1989 forests between 2008 
and the 2020. Unlike offsets in voluntary markets or in California, 
where permanence involves long-term contracts or insurance 
pools, forests in the New Zealand market liable for emissions when 
harvested or following land-use change. This means sellers account 
for future emission risks related to harvesting when they enter forests 
into carbon contracts. Offset prices were around USD13 tCO 2–1 in 

The voluntary market data in Table  7.4 are offsets developed 
under the major standard-setting organisations, and issued from 
2008–2018 (e.g., Hamrick and Gallant 2018). Note that there is some 
potential for double counting of voluntary offsets that may have 
been transacted in the California compliance market, however this 
would only have applied to transactions of US-issued offsets, and 
the largest share of annual transactions of voluntary AFOLU credits 
occurs with credits generated in Latin America, followed by Africa, 
Asia and North America. Europe and Oceania have few voluntary 
carbon market transactions. Within forestry and agriculture, most 
of the voluntary offsets were generated by forestry projects. Using 
historical transaction data from various Forest Trends reports, the 
offsets generated were valued at USD46.9 million yr–1. Prices for 
voluntary offset transactions in the period 2014–2016 ranged from 
USD4.90 to USD5.40 tCO 2–1 (Hamrick and Gallant 2017a).

period for development of forest and agricultural credits. The three 
regulatory markets quantified amount to USD2.7 billion in funding 
from 2010 to 2019. For the most part, this funding has focused on 
forest projects and programs, with agricultural projects accounting 
for 5–10% of the total. In total, reported funding for AFOLU 
projects and programmes has been USD4.4 billion over the past 
decade, or about USD569 million yr–1 (low confidence). The largest 
share of the total carbon includes efforts in the Amazon by Brazil. 
Government expenditures on regulatory programmes and business 
expenditures on voluntary programmes in Brazil (e.g.,  the soy or 
cattle moratoriums) were not included in financing estimates due to 
difficulties obtaining that data. If Brazil and CDM (for which we have 
no cost estimates) are left out of the calculation, average cost per ton 
has been USD3.20 tCO 2–1.
The large number of policy approaches described in Table  7.4 
combined with efforts by other international actors, such as the 
Global Environmental Facility (GEF), as well as non-state actors 
(e.g.,  eco-labelling programmes and corporate social responsibility 
initiatives) illustrate significant policy experimentation over the last 
several decades. Despite widespread effort, AFOLU measures have 
thus far failed to achieve the large potential for climate mitigation 
described in earlier IPCC WG III reports (high confidence). The limited 
gains from AFOLU to date appear largely to result from lack of 
investment and other institutional and social barriers, rather than 
methodological concerns (high confidence).
7.6.2 Review of Observed Policies 
and Policy Instruments
7.6.2.1 Economic Incentives
Emissions Trading/Carbon Taxes. While emissions trading 
programmes have been developed across the globe, forest and 
agriculture have not been included as part of the cap in any of the 
existing systems. However, offsets from forestry and agriculture 
have been included in several of the trading programs. New Zealand 
has a  hybrid programme where carbon storage in forests can be 
voluntarily entered into the carbon trading program, but once 
entered, forests are counted both as a sink for carbon if net gains 
are positive, and a  source when harvesting occurs. New Zealand 
is considering rules to include agricultural GHG emissions under 
a future cap (Henderson et al. 2020; see: https://www.agmatters.nz/
topics/he-waka-eke-noa/).
The state of California has developed a  formal cap and trade 
programme that allows a limited number of forest and agricultural 
offset credits to be used under the cap. All offsets must meet protocols 
to account for additionality, permanence and leakage. Forest projects 
used as offsets in California currently are located in the USA, but 
the California Air Resources Board adopted a tropical forest carbon 
standard, allowing for avoided deforestation projects from outside 
the USA to enter the California market (CARB 2019).Canadian provinces have developed a range of policy options that can 
include carbon offsets. Quebec has an emissions trading programme 
that plans to allow forest and agricultural offsets generated within 
the province to be utilised. Alberta also allows offsets to be utilised by 
regulated sectors while British Columbia allows offsets to be utilised 
by the government for its carbon neutrality goals (Government of 
Alberta, 2021). Over 20 countries and regions have adopted explicit 
carbon taxes on carbon emission sources and fossil fuels, however, 
the charges have not been applied to non-CO 2 agricultural emissions 
(OECD 2021a). California may implement regulations on methane 
emissions from cattle, however, regulations if approved, will not 
go into effect until 2024. Institutional and trade-related barriers 
(e.g., leakage) likely will limit widespread implementation of taxes 
on emissions in the food sector globally. Many countries exempt 
purchases of fuels used in agricultural or fishery production from 
fuel or carbon taxes, thus lowering the effective tax rate imposed on 
those sectors (OECD 2021a). Furthermore, bioenergy, produced from 
agricultural products, agricultural waste, and wood is often exempted 
from explicit carbon taxes. Colombia recently implemented a carbon 
tax on liquid fuels but allowed domestically produced forestry credits 
to offset the tax. Colombia also is in the process of developing an 
emissions trading scheme (OECD 2021a).
REDD+/Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES). PES programmes 
for a  variety of ecosystem services have long been utilised for 
conservation (e.g.,  Wunder 2007) and may now be as large as 
USD42  billion yr–1 (Salzman et al. 2018). REDD+ emerged in the 
early 2000s and is a widely recognised example of PES programme 
focused on conservation of tropical forests (Table  7.4). However, 
our summation of actually paid funds in Table 7.4 is much smaller 
than what is portrayed by Salzman et al. (2018). REDD+ may 
operate at the country level, or for specific programmes or forests 
within a country. As with other PES programs, REDD+ has evolved 
towards a  results-based programme that involves payments that 
are conditioned on meeting certain successes or milestones, such as 
rates of deforestation (Angelsen 2017).
A large literature has investigated whether PES programmes have 
successfully protected habitats. Studies in the USA found limited 
additionality for programmes that encouraged conservation tillage 
practices, but stronger additionality for programmes that encouraged 
set-asides for grasslands or forests (Woodward et al. 2016; Claassen 
et al. 2018), although the set-asides led to estimated leakage of 

Evidence from the EU similarly suggests that payments for some 
agroenvironmental practices may be additional, while others are not 
(Chabé-Ferret and Subervie 2013). Other studies, in particular in Latin 
America where many PES programmes have been implemented, have 
found a wide range of estimates of effectiveness (e.g., Honey-Rosés 
et al. 2011; Robalino and Pfaff 2013; Alix-Garcia et al. 2015; Robalino 
et al. 2015; Mohebalian and Aguilar 2016; Jayachandran et al. 2017; 
Börner et al. 2017; Burivalova et al. 2019). Despite concerns, the 
many lessons learned from PES programme implementation provide 
critical information that will help policymakers refine future PES 
programmes to increase their effectiveness (medium confidence).
and efficient mechanism for climate mitigation have not been met 
(Turnhout et al. 2017; Arts et al. 2019), progress has nonetheless 
occurred. Measuring, monitoring and verification systems have been 
developed and deployed, REDD readiness programmes have improved 
capacity to implement REDD+ on the ground in over 50 countries, and 
a number of countries now have received results-based payments.
Empirical evidence that REDD+ funding has slowed deforestation 
is starting to emerge. Simonet et al. (2019) showed that a REDD+ 
project in Brazil reduced deforestation certainly until 2018, while 
Roopsind et al. (2019) showed that country-level REDD+ payments 
to Guyana encouraged reduced deforestation and increased carbon 
storage. Although more impact evaluation (IE) analysis needs to be 
conducted on REDD+ payments, these studies support the country-
level estimates of carbon benefits from REDD+ shown in Table 7.4. 
Nearly all of the analysis of PES and REDD+ to date has focused 
on the presence or absence of forest cover, with little to no analysis 
having been conducted on forest degradation, conservation, or 
enhancement of forest stocks.
Agroenvironmental Subsidy Programs/PES.  Climate policy 
for agriculture has developed more slowly than in other sectors 
due to concerns with food security and livelihoods, political 
interests,  and difficulties in coordinating diffuse and diverse 
activities and stakeholders (e.g., nutritional health, rural development, 
and biodiversity conservation) (Leahy et al. 2020). However, a review 
of the National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPAs), National 
Adaptation Plans (NAPs), NAMAs, and NDCs in the Paris Agreement 
suggest an increasing focus of policy makers on agriculture and 
food security. The vast majority of parties to the Paris Agreement 
recognise the significant role of agriculture in supporting a secure 
sustainable development pathway (Richards and VanWey 2015) with 
the inclusion of agriculture mitigation in 103 NDCs from a total of 

agricultural sub-sector, with mitigation activities generally focusing 
on increasing efficiency and productivity.
Agriculture is one of the most subsidised industries globally, especially 
in the European Union and the USA. While subsidy payments over 
the last 20 years have shifted modestly to programmes designed 
to reduce the environmental impact of the agricultural sector, 
only 15–20% of the more than USD700 billion spent globally on 
subsidies are green payments (OECD 2021b). Under the Common 
Agricultural Policy in the EU, up to 30% of the direct payments to 
farmers (Pillar 1) have been green payments (Henderson et al. 2020), 
including some actions that could increase carbon storage or reduce 
emissions. Similarly, at least 30% of the rural development payments 
(Pillar 2) are used for measures that reduce environmental impact, 
including reduction of GHG emissions and carbon storage. There is 
limited evidence that these policies contributed to the 20% reduction 
in GHG emissions from the agricultural sector in the EU between 

The USA spends USD4 billion yr–1 on conservation programs, or 12% of 
net farm income (Department of Agriculture 2020). In real terms, this 
expenditure has remained constant for 15 years, supporting 12 Mha of permanent grass or woodland cover in the Conservation Reserve 
Program (CRP), which has increased soil carbon sequestration by 

other practices that could lower net emissions. Gross GHG emissions 
from the agricultural sector in the US, however, have increased since 

US CRP programme and changes in crop rotations, both of which 
caused soil carbon stocks to decline (USEPA 2020). When combined 
with increased non-CO 2 gas emissions, the emission intensity of US 
agriculture increased from 1.5 to 1.7 tCO 2 ha–1 between 2005 and 

China has implemented large conservation programmes that have 
influenced carbon stocks. For example, the Sloping Land Conversion 
Program, combined with other programs, has increased forest cover 
and carbon stocks, reduced erosion and increased other ecosystem 
services in China in recent years (Ouyang et al. 2016). As part of Brazil’s 
national strategy, numerous practices to reduce GHG emissions from 
agriculture, and in particular from the animal agriculture industry, 
have been subsidised. Estimates by Manzatto et al. (2020) suggest 
that the programme may have reduced agricultural emissions by 

economic potential for agroforestry to be deployed in Africa, subsidy 
approaches could be deployed along with other polices to enhance 
carbon through innovative practices such as regreening (Box 7.10).
7.6.2.2 Regulatory Approaches
Regulations on land use include direct controls on how land is 
used, zoning, or legally set limits on converting land from one use to 
another. Since the early 2000s, Brazil has deployed various regulatory 
measures to slow deforestation, including enforcement of regulations 
on land-use change in the legal Amazon area. Enforcement of these 
regulations, among other approaches is credited with encouraging 
the large-scale reduction in deforestation and associated carbon 
emissions after 2004 (Nepstad et al. 2014). Empirical evidence has 
found that regulations reduced deforestation in Brazil (Arima et al. 
2014) but over time, reversals occurred when enforcement was not 
consistent (Azevedo et al. 2017) (Box 7.9).
Many OECD countries have strong legal frameworks that influence 
agricultural and forest management on both public and private land. 
These include for example, legal requirements to protect endangered 
species, implement conservation tillage, protect riparian areas, replant 
forests after harvest, maintain historical species composition, forest 
certification, and other approaches. Increasingly, laws support more 
widespread implementation of nature-based solutions for a  range 
of environmental issues (e.g., see European Commission-EU 2021). 
The extent to which the combined influence of these regulations has 
enhanced carbon storage in ecosystems is not quantified although 
they are likely to explain some of the persistent carbon sink that has 
emerged in temperate forests of OECD countries (high confidence). In 
the least developed and developing countries, regulatory approaches 
face challenges in part because environmental issues are a  lower 
priority than many other socio-economic issues (e.g.,  poverty, 
opportunity, essential services), and weak governance (Mayer 
Pelicice 2019; Walker et al. 2020) (Box 7.2).
for conservation, and according to (FAO 2020d), 726 Mha (18%) of 
forests are in protected areas globally. A review of land sparing and 
land sharing policies in developing countries indicated that most of 
them follow land sparing models, sometimes in combination with 
land sharing approaches. However, there is still no clear evidence of 
which policy provides the best results for ecosystem services provision, 
conservation, and livelihoods (Mertz and Mertens 2017). The literature 
contains a  wide range of results on the effectiveness of protected 
areas to reduce deforestation (Burivalova et al. 2019), with studies 
suggesting that protected areas provide significant protection of 
forests (e.g., Blackman 2015), modest protection (Andam et al. 2008), 
as well as increases in deforestation (Blackman 2015) and possible 
leakage of harvesting to elsewhere (Kallio et al. 2018). An estimate 
of the contributions of protected areas to mitigation between 2000 
and 2012, showed that in the tropics, PAs reduced carbon emissions 
from deforestation by 4.88 PgC, or around 29%, when compared to the 
expected rates of deforestation (Bebber and Butt 2017). In that study, the tropical Americas (368.8 TgC yr−1) had the largest contribution, 
followed by Asia (25.0 TgC yr−1) and Africa (12.7 TgC yr−1). The 
authors concluded that local factors had an important influence on the 
effectiveness of protected areas. For example, in the Brazilian Amazon, 
protected area effectiveness is affected by the government agency 
controlling the land (federal indigenous lands, federal PAs, and state 
PAs) (Herrera et al. 2019). Because protected areas limit not just land-
use change, but also logging or harvesting non-timber forest products, 
they may be relatively costly approaches for forest conservation 
(medium confidence).
Community forest management (CFM) allows less intensive use 
of forest resources, while at the same time providing carbon benefits 
by protecting forest cover. Community forest management provides 
property rights to communities to manage resources in exchange 
for their efforts to protect those resources. In many cases, the local 
communities are indigenous people who otherwise would have 
insecure tenure due to an advancing agricultural frontier or mining 
Box 7.8 | Management of Native Forests by the Menominee people in North America 
and Lessons From Forest Owner Associations
Summary of the case.Indigenous peoples include more than 5000 different peoples, with over 370 million people, in 70 countries 
on five continents (UNIPP 2012). For example, in Latin America and Caribbean, forests cover more than 80% of the area occupied by 
indigenous peoples (330 million hectares) (FAO and FILAC, 2021) which points to their critical role for forest governance (Garnett et al. 
2018; Fa et al. 2020). The Menominee people (Wisconsin, USA) practice sustainable forestry on their reservation according to a land 
ethic integral to the tribal identity. The Tribe calls themselves ‘The Forest Keepers’, recognising that the connection of their future to 
the sustainable management of the forest that allowed the forest volume standing today to be higher than when timber harvesting 
began more than 160 years ago. Management practices are based on continuous forest inventories (Mausel et al. 2017).
Introduction to the case. Forest management and timber harvesting operations began shortly after the Menominee Indian Reservation 
was created by treaty in 1854. The Menominee reservation sits on about 95,000 ha of land in Wisconsin that spans multiple forest types 
and is more diverse than adjacent forests. The collectively maintained reservation has 87% of its land under sustained yield forestry.
Case description. The Tribe, in the 19th century, had already mastered vegetation manipulation with fire, sustainable forestry, 
multiple-use, ecosystem, and adaptive management. The centrepiece of the Tribe’s economy has been its forest product industry, 
Menominee Tribal Enterprises (MTE) (Pecore 1992). A balance between growth and removals and continuous forest inventories (CFI) 
are central for forest management for the past 160 years, aiming not at very large volumes, but at very high-quality trees. During this 
same period, more than 2.3 billion board feet have been harvested from the same area, equivalent to 0.3 m3 ha–1 yr–1.
Interactions and limitations. In 2013, the Menominee Tribe started a collaboration with the US Forest Service to implement climate 
adaptation measures. The Tribe actively works to reduce the risk of forest damage and decided to further promote diversity by 
planting tree seedlings adapted to a warming climate (https://toolkit.climate.gov/case-studies/and-trees-will-last-forever). However, 
new challenges are related to increasing pressures on forest ecosystems such as non-native insects, pathogens, weed invasions, and 
the costs for continuous forest inventories to support long-term forest management. 
Identified lessons. The elements of sustainability are intertwined with Menominee history, culture, spirituality, and ethics. The 
balance between the environment, community, and economy for the short term as well as future generations is an example of 
protecting the entire environment as the Menominee land is a non-fragmented remnant of the prehistoric Lake States forest which 
has been dramatically reduced all around the reserve (Schabel and Pecore 1997). These and other types of community forest owner 
associations exist all over the world. Examples are Södra in Sweden (with 52,000 forest owners) (Södra, 2021) or Waldbauernverband 
in North-Rhine Westphalia (with 150,000 forest owners and covering 585,000 ha) (AGDW-The Forest Owners, 2021). These are ways 
for small forest owners to educate, jointly put wood on the market, employ better forest management, use machinery together, and 
apply certification jointly. In this manner and with all their diversity of goals, they manage to maintain carbon sinks and stocks, while 
preserving biodiversity and producing wood.
discussed in Box 7.8. According to the Rights and Resources Initiative 
(2018), the area of forests under community management increased 
globally by 152 Mha from 2002 to 2017, with over 500 Mha under 
community management in 2017. Studies have now shown that 
improved property rights with community forest management can 
reduce deforestation and increase carbon storage (Deininger and 
Minten 2002; Alix-Garcia et al. 2005; Alix-Garcia 2007; Bowler 
et al. 2012; Blackman 2015; Fortmann et al. 2017; Burivalova et al. 
2019). Efforts to expand property rights, especially community forest 
management, have reduced carbon emissions from deforestation in 
tropical forests in the last two decades (high confidence), although 
the extent of carbon savings has not been quantified globally.
Bioenergy targets. Multiple policies have been enacted at national 
and supra-national levels to promote the use of bioenergy in the 
transport sector, and for bioelectricity production. Existing policies 
mandate or subsidise the production and use of bioenergy. In 
the past few years, policies have been proposed, put in place or 
updated in Australia (Renewable Energy Target), Brazil (RenovaBio, 
Nationally Determined Contribution), Canada (Clean Fuel Standard), 
China (Biodiesel Industrial Development Policy, Biodiesel Fuel Blend 
Standard), the European Union (Renewable Energy Directive II), the 
USA (Renewable Fuel Standards), Japan (FY2030), Russia (Energy 
Strategy Bill 2035), India (Revised National Policy on Biofuels), and 
South Africa (Biofuels Regulatory Framework).
While current policies focus on bioenergy to decarbonise the energy 
system, some also contain provisions to minimise the potential 
environmental and social trade-offs from bioenergy production. 
For instance, the EU Renewable Energy Directive (EU-RED II) and 
US Renewable Energy Standard (US-RFS) assign caps on the use 
of biofuels, which are associated with indirect land-use change 
and food-security concerns. The Netherlands has a stringent set of 

comply. The EU-RED II also sets a timeline for the complete phase-
out of high-risk biofuels (Section 7.4.4).
7.6.2.3 Voluntary Actions and Agreements
Forest certification programs, such as Forest Sustainability Council 
(FSC) or Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification 
(PEFC), are consumer driven, voluntary programmes that influence timber harvesting practices, and may reduce emissions from forest 
degradation with reduced impact logging and other approaches 
(medium confidence). Forest certification has expanded globally  to 
over 440 Mha (Kraxner et al. 2017). As the area of land devoted 
to  certification has increased, the amount of timber produced from 
certified land has increased. In 2018, FSC accounted for harvests of 

in 2016 or around 40% of total industrial wood production (FAO 
2018c). There is evidence that reduced impact logging can reduce 
carbon losses in tropical regions (Pearson et al. 2014; Ellis et al. 2019). 
However, there is conflicting evidence about whether forest certification 
reduces deforestation (e.g., Blackman et al. 2018; Tritsch et al. 2020).
Supply chain management in the food sector encourages 
more widespread use of conservation measures in agriculture 
(high confidence). The number of private commitments to reduce 
deforestation from supply chains has greatly increased in recent 
years, with at least 865 public commitments by 447 producers, 
processors, traders, manufacturers and retailers as of December, 2020 
(New York Declaration on Forests 2021). Industry partnerships with 
NGOs, such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), have 
become more widespread and visible in agricultural production. For 
example, RSPO certifies members all along the supply chain for palm 
oil and claims around 19% of total production. Similar sustainability 
efforts exist for many of the world’s major agricultural products, 
including soybeans, rice, sugar cane, and cattle.
There is evidence that the Amazon Soy Moratorium (ASM), an industry-
NGO effort whereby large industry consumers agreed voluntarily not 
to purchase soybeans grown on land deforested after 2006, reduced 
deforestation in the legal Amazon (Nepstad et al. 2014; Gibbs et al. 
2015). However, recent studies have shown that some deforestation 
from the Amazon was displaced to the Cerrado (Brazilian savannas) 
region (Moffette and Gibbs 2021), which is a  global hotspot for 
biodiversity, and has significant carbon stocks. These results illustrate 
the importance of broadening the scope of supply chain management 
to minimise or eliminate displacement (Lima et al. 2019). In addition, 
while voluntary efforts may improve environmental outcomes for a time, 
it is not clear that they are sufficient to deliver long-term reductions in 
deforestation, given the increases in deforestation that have occurred 
in the Amazon in recent years (Box 7.9). Voluntary efforts would be 
more effective at slowing deforestation if they present stronger 
linkages to regulatory or other approaches (Lambin et al. 2018).
Box 7.9 | Case Study: Deforestation Control in the Brazilian Amazon
Summary
Between 2000 and 2004, deforestation rates in the Brazilian Legal Amazon (is a socio-geographic division containing all nine Brazilian 
states in the Amazon basin) increased from 18,226 to 27,772 km2 yr–1 2008 (INPE, 2021). A  set of public policies designed in 
participatory process involving federal government, states, municipalities, and civil society successfully reduced deforestation rates 
until 2012. However, deforestation rates increased after 2013, and particularly between 2019 and 2020. Successful deforestation 
control policies are being negatively affected by changes in environmental governance, weak law enforcement, and polarisation of 
the national politics.
Background
In 2004, the Brazilian federal government started the Action Plan for Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon 
(PPCDAm) (Ministry of Environment, Government of Brazil, 2018).
The PPCDAm was a  benchmark for the articulation of forest conservation policies that included central and state governments, 
prosecutor offices, and the civil society. The decline in deforestation after 2008 is mostly attributed to these policy options. In 2012, 
deforestation rates decreased to 4,571 km2 yr–1.
Case description
Combating deforestation was a  theme in several programs, government plans, and projects not being more restricted to the 
environmental agenda. This broader inclusion resulted from a long process of insertion and articulation in the government dating 
back to 2003 while elaborating on the Sustainable Amazon Plan. In May 2003, a historic meeting took place in an Amazonian city, 
with the president of the Republic, state governors, ministers, and various business leaders, civil institutions, and social movements. It 
was presented and approved the document entitled ‘Sustainable Amazonia – Guidelines and Priorities of the Ministry of Environment 
for the Sustainable Development of the Amazon Brazilian’, containing several guidelines for conservation and sustainable use in the 
region. At the meeting, the Union and some states signed a Cooperation Agreement aiming to elaborate a plan for the Amazon, to be 
widely discussed with the various sectors of the regional and national society (Ministerio do Meio Ambiente, MMA, 2013).
Interactions and limitations
The PPCDAm had three main lines of action: (i) territorial management and land use; (ii) command and control; and (iii) promotion 
of sustainable practices. During the execution of the 1st and 2nd phases of the PPCDAm (2004–2011), important results in the 
territorial management and land-use component included, for example, the creation of 25 Mha of federal Protected Areas (PAs) 
located mainly in front of the expansion of deforestation, as well as the homologation of 10 Mha of Indigenous Lands. Also, states 
and municipalities created approximately 25 Mha, so that all spheres of government contributed to the expansion of PAs in the 
Brazilian Amazon. In the ‘command and control’ component, agencies performed hundreds of inspection operations against illegal 
activities (e.g., illegal logging) under strategic planning based on technical and territorial priorities. Besides, there was a significant 
improvement of the environmental monitoring systems, involving the analysis of satellite images to guide actions on the ground. 
Another policy was the restriction of public credit to enterprises linked to illegal deforestation following a resolution of the Brazilian 
Central Bank (2008) (Ministerio do Meio Ambiente, MMA, 2013). Also, in 2008, Brazil created the Amazon Fund, a REDD+ mechanism 
(Government of Brazil, n.d.).
However, the country’s political polarisation has gradually eroded environmental governance, especially after the Brazilian Forest 
Code changes in 2012 (major environmental law in Brazil), the presidential impeachment in 2016, presidential elections in 2018, and 
the start of the new federal administration in 2019. Successful deforestation control policies are being negatively affected by critical 
changes in the political context, and weakening the environmental rule of law, forest conservation, and sustainable development 
programmes (for example, changes in the Amazon Fund governance in disagreement with the main donors). In 2019, the annual 
deforestation rate reached 10,129 km2 being the first time it surpassed 10,000 km2 since 2008 (INPE, 2021). Besides, there has been 
no effective transition from the historical economic model to a sustainable one. The lack of clarity in the ownership of land is still 
a major unresolved issue in the Amazon.
Lessons
The reduction of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon was possible due to effective political and institutional support for environmental 
conservation. The initiatives of the Action Plan included the expansion of the protected areas network (conservation unities and 
indigenous lands), improvement of deforestation monitoring to the enforcement of environmental laws, and the use of economic 
instruments, for example, by cutting off public credit for municipalities with higher deforestation rates (Ricketts et al. 2010; Souza et al. 
2013; Nepstad et al. 2014; Arima et al. 2014; Blackman and Veit 2018). 
The array of public policies and social engagement was a historical and legal breakthrough in global protection. However, the broader 
political and institutional context and actions to reduce the representation and independent control of civil society movements in 
decision-making bodies weaken this structure with significant increases in deforestation rates, burnings, and forest fires.
Permanence and Leakage
Additionality, permanence and leakage have been widely discussed 
in the forestry and agricultural mitigation literature (Murray et al. 
2007), including in AR5 (Section 11.3.2 of the AR5WGIII report) and 
earlier assessment reports. Since the earlier assessment reports, 
new studies have emerged to provide new insights on the effect of 
these issues on the credibility of forest and agricultural mitigation. 
This assessment also provides additional context not considered in 
earlier assessments.
Typically, carbon registries will require that project developers 
show additionality by illustrating that the project is not undertaken 
as a  result of a  legal requirement, and that the project achieves 
carbon reductions above and beyond a  business as usual. The 
protocols developed by the California Air Resources Board to ensure 
permanence and additionality are strong standards and may even 
limit participation (e.g., Ruseva et al. 2017). The business as usual 
is defined as past management actions by the same entity that 
can be verified. Additionality can thus be observed in the future as 
a  difference from historical actions. This approach has been used 
by several countries in their UNFCCC Biennial Update reports to 
establish reductions in carbon emissions from avoided deforestation 
(e.g., Brazil and Indonesia).However, alternative statistical approaches have been deployed in the 
literature to assess additionality with a quasi-experimental method that 
rely on developing a counterfactual (e.g., Andam et al. 2008; Blackman 
2015; Sills et al. 2015; Fortmann et al. 2017; Roopsind et al. 2019). In 
several studies, additionality in avoided deforestation was established 
after the project had been developed by comparing land-use change in 
treated plots where the policy or programme was in effect with land-
use change in similar untreated plot. Alternatively, synthetic matching 
statistically compares trends in a  treated region (i.e., a  region with 
a policy) to trends in a region without the policy, and has been applied 
in a region in Brazil (e.g., Sills et al. 2015), and at the country level 
in Guyana (Roopsind et al. 2019). While these analyses establish that 
many projects to reduce deforestation have overcome hurdles related 
to additionality (high confidence), there has not been a  systematic 
assessment of the elements of project or programme design that lead 
to high levels of additionality. Such assessment could help developers 
design projects to better meet additionality criteria.
The same experimental methods have been applied to analyse 
additionality of the adoption of soil conservation and nutrient 
management practices in agriculture. Claassen et al. (2018) find that 
programmes to promote soil conservation are around 50% additional 
across the USA (i.e., 50% of the land enrolled in soil conservation 
programmes would not have been enrolled if not for the programme), 
while Woodward et al. (2016) find that adoption of conservation Box 7.10 | Regreening the Sahel, Northern Africa
Case description
More than 200 million trees have regenerated on more than 5 Mha in the Sahel (Sendzimir et al. 2011). The Maradi/Zinder region of 
Niger is the epicentre of experimentation and scale up. This vast geographic extent generates significant mitigation potential despite 
the relatively modest per unit area increase in carbon of about 0.4 MgC ha–1 a–1 (Luedeling and Neufeldt 2012). In addition to the 
carbon benefits, these agroforestry systems decrease erosion, provide animal fodder, recharge groundwater, generate nutrition and 
income benefits and act as safety nets for vulnerable rural households during climate and other shocks (Bayala et al. 2014, 2015; 
Binam et al. 2015; Sinare and Gordon 2015; Ilstedt et al. 2016).
Lessons
A mélange of factors contributed to regreening in the Sahel. Increased precipitation, migration, community development, economic 
volatility and local policy reform have all likely played a role (Haglund et al. 2011; Sendzimir et al. 2011; Brandt et al. 2019a; Garrity and 
Bayala 2019); the easing of forestry regulations has been particularly critical in giving farmers greater control over the management 
and use of trees on their land (Garrity et al. 2010). This policy shift was catalysed by greater regional autonomy resulting from 
economic decline and coincided with successful pilots and NGO-led experimentation, cash-for-work, and training efforts to support 
changes in land management (Sendzimir et al. 2011). Participation of farmers in planning and implementation helped align actions 
with local knowledge and goals as well as market opportunities.
Regreening takes place when dormant seed or tree stumps sprout and are cultivated through the technique, called Farmer Managed 
Natural Regeneration (FMNR). Without planting new trees, FMNR is presumed to be cheaper than other approaches to restoration, 
though comparative economic analysis has yet to be conducted (Chomba et al. 2020). Relatively lower investment costs are believed 
to have contributed to the replication across the landscape. These factors worked together to contribute to a groundswell of action 
that affected rights, access, and use of local resources (Tougiani et al. 2009).
Regreening in the Sahel and the consequent transformation of the landscape has resulted from the actions of hundreds of thousands 
of individuals responding to social and biophysical signals (Hanan 2018). This is an example for climate change mitigation, where 
eliminating regulations – versus increasing them – has led to carbon dioxide removal.
for nutrient management plans are nearly 100% additional, although 
there is little evidence that farmers reduce nutrient inputs when they 
adopt plans. It is not clear if the same policy approaches would lead 
to additionality in other regions.
Permanence focuses on the potential for carbon sequestered in 
offsets to be released in the future due to natural or anthropogenic 
disturbances. Most offset registries have strong permanence 
requirements, although they vary in their specific requirements. The 
Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) from the Verra programme requires 
a  pool of additional carbon credits that provides a  buffer against 
inadvertent losses. The Climate Action Reserve (CAR) protocol for 
forests requires carbon to remain on the site for 100 years. The carbon 
on the site will be verified at pre-determined intervals over the life 
of the project. If carbon is diminished on a given site, the credits for 
the site have to be relinquished and the project developer has to use 
credits from their reserve fund (either other projects or purchased 
credits) to make up for the loss. Estimates of leakage in forestry 
projects in AR5 suggest that it can range from 10% to over 90% in 
the USA (Murray et al. 2004), and 20–50% in the tropics (Sohngen 
and Brown 2004) for forest set-asides and reduced harvesting. 
Carbon offset protocols have made a  variety of assumptions. The 
Climate Action Reserve (CAR) assumes it is 20% in the USA. One of 
the voluntary protocols (Verra) uses specific information about the 
location of the project to calculate a location specific leakage factor.
More recent literature has developed explicit estimates of leakage 
based on statistical analysis of carbon projects or programs. The 
literature suggests that there are two economic pathways for leakage 
(e.g.,  (Roopsind et al. 2019), either through a  shift in output price 
that occurs when outputs are affected by the policy or programme 
implementation, as described in (Wear and Murray 2004; Murray et al. 
2004; Sohngen and Brown 2004; Gan and McCarl 2007), or through 
a shift in input prices and markets, such as for labour or capital, as 
analysed in (Andam et al. 2008; Alix-Garcia et al. 2012; Honey-Rosés 
et al. 2011; Fortmann et al. 2017). Estimates of leakage through product 
markets (e.g.,  timber prices) have suggested leakage of up to 90% 
(Sohngen and Brown 2004; Murray et al. 2004; Gan and McCarl 2007; 
Kallio et al. 2018), while studies that consider shifts in input markets are 
considerably smaller. The analysis of leakage for the Guyana programme 
by Roopsind et al. (2019) revealed no statistically significant leakage in 
Suriname. A key design feature for any programme to reduce leakage 
is to increase incentives for complementary mitigation policies to be 
implemented in areas where leakage may occur. Efforts to continue 
to draw more forests into carbon policy initiatives will reduce leakage 
over time Roopsind et al. (2019), suggesting that if NDCs continue to 
encompass a broader selection of policies, measures and forests over 
time, leakage will decline.
7.6.3  Assessment of Current Policies and Potential 
Future Approaches
The Paris Agreement encourages a wide range of policy approaches, 
including REDD+, sustainable management of forests, joint 
mitigation and adaptation, and emphasises the importance of non-carbon benefits and equity for sustainable development (Martius 
et al. 2016). Around USD0.7 billion yr–1 has been invested in land-
based carbon offsets (Table 7.4), but as noted in Streck (2012), there 
is a large funding gap between these efforts and the scale of efforts 
necessary to meet 1.5 or 2.0°C targets outlined in SR1.5. As Box 7.12 
discusses, forestry actions could achieve up to 5.8 GtCO 2 yr–1 with 
costs rising from USD178 billion yr–1 to USD400 billion yr–1 by 2050. 
Over half of this investment is expected to occur in Latin America, 
with 13% in SE Asia and 17% in sub-Saharan Africa (Austin et al. 
2020). Other studies have suggested that similar sized programmes 
are possible, although they do not quantify total costs (e.g., Griscom 
et al. 2017; Busch et al. 2019). The currently quantified efforts 
to reduce net emissions with forests and agricultural actions are 
helpful, but society will need to quickly ramp up investments to 
achieve carbon sequestration levels consistent with high levels of 
mitigation. Only 2.5% of climate mitigation funding goes to land-
based mitigation options, an order of magnitude below the potential 
proportional contribution (Buchner et al. 2015).
To date, there has been significantly less investment in agricultural 
projects than forestry projects to reduce net carbon emissions 
(Table  7.4). For example, the economic potential (available up 
to USD100 tCO 2–1) for soil carbon sequestration in croplands is 
1.9  (0.4–6.8) GtCO 2 yr–1 (Section  7.4.3.1), however, less than 2% 
of the carbon in Table 7.4 is derived from soil carbon sequestration 
projects. While reductions in CH 4 emissions due to enteric fermentation 
constitute a large share of potential agricultural mitigation reported 
in Section 7.4, agricultural CH 4 emission reductions so far have been 
relatively modest compared to forestry sequestration. The protocols 
to quantify emission reductions in the agricultural sector are available 
and have been tested, and the main limitation appears to be the 
lack of available financing or the unwillingness to re-direct current 
subsidies (medium confidence).
Although quantified emission reductions in agricultural projects 
are limited to date, a  number of OECD and economy in transition 
parties have reduced their net emissions through carbon storage 
in cropland soils since 2000. These reductions in emissions have 
typically resulted from policy innovations outside of the climate 
space, or market trends. For example, in the USA, there has been 
widespread adoption of conservation tillage in the last 30 years as 
a labour-saving crop management technique. In Europe, agricultural 
N2O and CH 4 emissions have declined due to reductions in nutrient 
inputs and cattle numbers (Henderson et al. 2020). These reductions 
may be attributed to mechanism within the Common Agricultural 
Policy (Section 7.6.2.1), but could also be linked to higher nutrient 
prices in the 2000–2014 period. Other environmental policies 
could play a  role, for example, efforts to reduce water pollution 
from phosphorus in The Netherlands, may ultimately reduce cattle 
numbers, also lowering CH 4 emissions.
Numerous developing countries have established policy efforts 
to abate agricultural emissions or increase carbon storage. Brazil, 
for instance, developed a  subsidy programme in 2010 to promote 
sustainable development in agriculture, and practices that would 
reduce GHG emissions. Henderson et al. (2020) report that this 
programme reduced GHG emission in agricultural by up to 
low-carbon agriculture in Brazil amounted only 2% of the total funds 
for conventional agriculture in 2019. Programmes on deforestation 
in Brazil had successes and failures, as described in Box  7.9. 
Indonesia has engaged in a wide range of programmes in the REDD+ 
space, including a  moratorium implemented in 2011 to prevent 
the conversion of primary forests and peatlands to oil palm and 
logging concessions (Wijaya et al. 2017; Tacconi and Muttaqin 2019; 
Henderson et al. 2020). Efforts to restore peatlands and forests have 
also been undertaken. Indonesia reports that results-based REDD+ 
programmes have been successful and have led to lower rates of 
deforestation (Table 7.4).
Existing policies focused on GHG management in agriculture 
and forestry is less advanced in Africa than in Latin American and 
Asia, however, Henderson et al. (2020) report on 10 countries in 
sub-Saharan Africa that have included explicit policy proposals 
for reducing AFOLU GHG emissions through their NDCs. These 
include efforts to reduce N 2O emission, increase implementation 
of conservation agriculture, improve livestock management, and 
implement forestry and grassland practices, including agroforestry (Box  7.10). Within several of the NDCs, countries have explicitly 
suggested intensification as an approach to reduce emission in the 
livestock sector. However, it is important to note caveats associated 
with pursuing mitigation via intensification (Box 7.11).
The agricultural sector throughout the world is influenced by many 
policies that affect production practices, crop choices and land use. 
It is difficult to quantify the effect of these policies on reference 
level GHG emissions from the sector, as well as the cost estimates 
presented in Sections 7.4 and 7.5. The presence of significant subsidy 
programmes intended to improve farmer welfare and rural livelihoods 
makes it more difficult to implement regulatory programmes aimed 
at reducing net emissions in agriculture, however, it may increase 
the potential to implement new subsidy programmes that encourage 
practices aimed at reducing net emissions (medium confidence). 
For instance, in the USA, crop insurance can influence both crop 
choices and land use (Miao et al. 2016; Claassen et al. 2017), both 
of which will affect emission trends. Regulations to limit nutrient 
applications have not been widely considered, however, federal 
subsidy programmes have been implemented to encourage farmers 
to conduct nutrient management planning.
Box 7.11 | Sustainable Intensification Within Agriculture: Evidence and Caveats
Introduction
Sustainable intensification (SI) has received considerable attention as a suggested means of pursuing increased overall production, 
reducing associated environmental externalities, and potentially releasing agricultural land for alternative uses, such as forestry 
or rewilding (Godfray and Garnett 2014; Pretty 2018). The concept was explored within the SRCCL (SRCCL (Mbow et al. 2019), 
Section 5.6.4.4 and Cross-Chapter Box 6 in Chapter 5). SI is context specific and dynamic, with no universally prescribed methodology 
(HLPE 2019). Equal importance is given to enhancing sustainability as to achieving agricultural intensification. The former aspect is 
often challenging to realise, measure and maintain.
The extent of sustainable intensification
Total global agricultural land area has remained relatively stable while overall production has increased in recent decades (Section 7.3), 
indicating that agricultural intensification, as judged by production per unit of land (Petersen and Snapp 2015; OECD and FAO 2019) has 
taken place. However, changes in agricultural land use and degradation of natural resources (UNEP 2019; IPBES 2019b) suggests that 
not all of this intensification is sustainable. Although agricultural intensification has led to less GHG emissions compared to a scenario 
where that intensification had not taken place (Burney et al. 2010), absolute agriculture related emissions have continued to increase 
(Section 7.2). Active pursuit of SI was found to be expanding, with implementation on an increasing area, notably in developing 
countries (Pretty et al. 2018), yet regional agricultural area expansion at the expense of native habitat also continues in such regions 
(Section 7.3). Although there are specific examples of SI (Box 7.13) global progress in achieving SI is acknowledged as slow (Cassman 
and Grassini 2020) with potentially multiple, context specific geophysical and socio-economic barriers to implementation (Firbank 
et al. 2018; da Silva et al. 2021).
Preconditions to ensure sustainable intensification
Increasing the total amount of product produced by improving production efficiency (output per unit of input) does not 
guarantee SI.  It will only be successful if increased production efficiency translates into reduced environmental and social impacts 
as well as increased production. For example, AR5 highlighted a growing emphasis on reducing GHG emissions per unit of product 
via increasing production efficiency (Smith et al. 2014), but reductions in absolute GHG emissions will only occur when production 
efficiency increases at a greater rate than the rate at which production increases (Clark et al. 2005).
Defined indicators are required. Measurement of SI requires multiple indicators and metrics. It can be assessed at farm, regional or 
global scales and temporal aspect must be considered. SI may warrant whole system redesign or land reallocation (Garnett et al. 2013; 
Pretty et al. 2018). Accordingly, there is high agreement concerning the need to consider multiple environmental and social outcomes 
land-based reservoirs involves considering short- and long-
term climate benefits, as well as interactions among various natural 
climate solution options. The benefits of various natural climate 
solutions depend on a variety of spatially dependent issues as well as 
institutional factors, including their management status (managed or 
unmanaged systems), their productivity, opportunity costs, technical 
difficulty of implementation, local willingness to consider, property 
rights and institutions, among other factors. Biomass energy, as 
described elsewhere in this chapter and in (Cross-Working Group 
Box  3 in Chapter  12), is a  potential example of an option with 
trade-offs that emerge when policies favour one type of mitigation 
strategy over another. Bioenergy production needs safeguards 
to limit negative impacts on carbon stocks on the land base as is 
already in place in the EU Renewable Energy Directive and several 
national schemes in Netherlands, UK and Denmark (Buchholz et al. 
2016; Khanna et al. 2017; DeCicco and Schlesinger 2018; Favero 
et al. 2020). It is argued that a carbon tax on only fossil fuel derived 
emissions, may lead to massive deployment of bioenergy, although 
the effects of such a  policy can be mitigated when combined 
with policies that encourage sustainable forest management and 
protection of forest carbon stocks as well as forest management 
certification (high confidence) (Nabuurs et al. 2017, Baker et al. 2019 
and Favero et al. 2020).
If biomass energy production expands and shifts to carbon 
capture and storage (e.g.,  BECCS) during the century, there could 
be a  significant increase in the area of crop and forestland used 
for biomass energy production (Sections  7.4 and 7.5). BECCS is 
not projected to be widely implemented for several decades, but 
in the meantime, policy efforts to advance land-based measures 
including reforestation and restoration activities (Strassburg et al. 2020) combined with sustainable management and provision of 
agricultural and wood products are widely expected to increase the 
terrestrial pool of carbon (Cross-Working Group Box 3 in Chapter 12). 
Carbon sequestration policies, sustainable land management (forest 
and agriculture), and biomass energy policies can be complementary 
(Favero et al. 2017; Baker et al. 2019). However, if private markets 
emerge for biomass and BECCS on the scale suggested in the SR1.5, 
policy efforts must ramp up to substantially value, encourage, and 
protect terrestrial carbon stocks and ecosystems to avoid outcomes 
inconsistent with many SDGs (high confidence).
7.6.4 Barriers and Opportunities for AFOLU Mitigation
The AR5 and other assessments have acknowledged many barriers 
and opportunities to effective implementation of AFOLU measures. 
Many of these barriers and opportunities focus on the context in 
developing countries, where a  significant portion of the world’s 
cost-effective mitigation exists, but where domestic financing for 
implementation is likely to be limited. The SSPs capture some of this 
context, and as a  result, IAMs (Section  7.5) exhibit a  wide range 
of land-use outcomes, as well as mitigation potential. Potential 
mitigation, however, will be influenced by barriers and opportunities 
that are not considered by IAMs or by bottom-up studies reviewed 
here. For example, more efficient food production systems, or 
sustainable intensification within agriculture, and globalised trade 
could enhance the extent of natural ecosystems leading to lower 
GHG emissions from the land system and lower food prices (Popp 
et al. 2017), but this (or any) pathway will create new barriers 
to implementation and encourage new opportunities, negating 
potential benefits (Box 7.11). It is critically important to consider the 
current context in any country.Box 7.11 (Continued) 
at wider spatial scales, such as catchments or regions (Weltin et al. 2018; Bengochea Paz et al. 2020; Cassman and Grassini 2020). 
Impacts may be considered in relative terms (per area or product unit), with relationships potentially antagonistic. Both area- and 
product unit-based metrics are valid, relevant under different contexts and useful in approaching SI, but do not capture overall impacts 
and trade-offs (Garnett 2014). To reduce the risk of unsustainable intensification, quantitative data and selection of appropriate 
metrics to identify and guide strategies are paramount (Garnett et al. 2013; Gunton et al. 2016; Cassman and Grassini 2020).
Avoiding unsustainable intensification
It is critical that intensification does not drive expansion of unsustainable practices. Increased productivity with associated economic 
reward could incentivise and reward agricultural land expansion, or environmentally and socially damaging practices on existing 
and former agricultural land (Ceddia et al. 2013; Phalan 2018). Accordingly, coordinated policies are crucial to ensuring desired 
outcomes (Godfray and Garnett 2014; Reddy et al. 2020; Kassam and Kassam 2020). Barretto et al. (2013) found that in agriculturally 
consolidated areas, land-use intensification coincided with either a  contraction of both cropland and pasture areas, or cropland 
expansion at the expense of pastures, both resulting in a stable farmed area. In contrast, in agricultural frontier areas, land-use 
intensification coincided with expansion of agricultural lands.
In conclusion, SI within agriculture is needed given the rising global population and the need to address multiple environmental 
and social externalities associated with agricultural activities. However, implementation requires strong stakeholder engagement, 
appropriate regulations, rigorous monitoring and verification and comprehensive outreach and knowledge exchange programmes.
Design and coverage of financing mechanisms. The lack of 
resources thus far committed to implementing AFOLU mitigation, 
income and access to alternative sources of income in rural households 
that rely on agriculture or forests for their livelihoods remains 
a  considerable barrier to adoption of AFOLU (high confidence). 
Section  7.6.1 illustrates that to date only USD0.7  billion  yr–1 has 
been spent on AFOLU mitigation, well short of the more than 
USD400 billion yr–1 that would be needed to achieve the economic 
potential described in Section  7.4. Despite long-term recognition 
that AFOLU can play an important role in mitigation, the economic 
incentives necessary to achieve AFOLU aspirations as part of the 
Paris Agreement or to maintain temperatures below 2.0°C have not 
emerged. Without quickly ramping up spending, the lack of funding 
to implement projects remains a substantial barrier (high confidence). 
Investments are critically important in the livestock sector, which has 
the highest emissions reduction potential among options because 
actions in the sector influence agriculture specific activities, such 
as enteric fermentation, as well as deforestation (Mayberry et al. 
2019). In many countries with export-oriented livestock industries, 
livestock farmers control large swaths of forests or re-forestable 
areas. Incentive mechanisms and funding can encourage adoption 
of mitigation strategies, but funding is currently too low to make 
consistent progress.
Scale and accessibility of financing. The largest share of funding 
to date has been for REDD+, and many of the commitments to 
date suggest that there will be significant funding in this area 
for the foreseeable future. Funding for conservation programmes 
in OECD countries and China affects carbon, but has been driven by other objectives such as water quality and species protection. 
Considerably less funding has been available for agricultural 
projects aimed at reducing carbon emissions, and outside of 
voluntary markets, there do not appear to be large sources 
of  funding emerging either through international organisations, 
or national programs. In the agricultural sector, funding for carbon 
must be obtained by redirecting existing resources from non-GHG 
conservation to GHG measures, or by developing new funding 
streams (Henderson et al. 2020).
Risk and uncertainty. Most approaches to reduce emissions, 
especially in agriculture, require new or different technologies that 
involve significant time or financial investments by the implementing 
landholders. Adoption rates are often slow due to risk aversion among 
agricultural operators. Many AFOLU measures require carbon to be 
compensated to generate positive returns, reducing the likelihood of 
implementation without clear financial incentives. Research to show 
costs and benefits is lacking in most parts of the world.
Poverty. Mitigation and adaptation can have important implications 
for vulnerable people and communities, for example, mitigation 
activities consistent with scenarios examined in the SR1.5 could raise 
food and fiber prices globally (Section. 7.5). In the NDCs, 82 Parties 
included references to social issues (e.g., poverty, inequality, human 
well-being, marginalisation), with poverty the most cited factor 
(70 Parties). The number of hungry and food insecure people in the 
world is growing, reaching 821 million in 2017, or one in every nine 
people (FAO 2018b), and two-thirds live in rural areas (Laborde 
Debucquet et al. 2020). Consideration of rural poverty and food 
insecurity is central in AFOLU mitigation because there are a large 
number of farms in the world (about 570 million), and most are 
Box 7.12 | Financing AFOLU Mitigation; What Are the Costs and Who Pays?
Achieving the large contribution to mitigation that the AFOLU sector can make requires public and private investment. Austin et al. 
(2020) estimate that in forestry, USD178 billion yr–1 is needed over the next decade to achieve 5 GtCO 2 yr–1, and investments need 
to ramp up to USD400 billion yr–1 by 2050 to expand effort to 6 GtCO 2 yr–1. Other land-based options, such as mangrove protection, 
peatland restoration, and agricultural options would increase this total cost estimate, but have smaller to negligible opportunity costs.
Financing needs in AFOLU, and in particular in forestry, include both the direct effects of any changes in activities – costs of planting 
or managing trees, net revenues from harvesting, costs of thinning, costs of fire management, and so on – as well as the opportunity 
costs associated with land-use change. Opportunity costs are a critical component of AFOLU finance, and must be included in any 
estimate of the funds necessary to carry out projects. They are largest, as share of total costs, in forestry because they play a prominent 
role in achieving high levels of afforestation, avoided deforestation, and improved forest management. In case of increasing soil 
carbon in croplands through reduced tillage, there are often cost savings associated with increased residues because there is less effort 
tilling, but the carbon effects per hectare are also modest. There could, however, be small opportunity costs in cases where residues 
may otherwise be marketed to a biorefinery. The effect of reduced tillage on yields varies considerably across sites and crop types, but 
tends to enhance yields modestly in the longer-run.
Opportunity costs are a direct financing costs for activities that require land uses to change. For instance a government can encourage 
planting forests on agricultural land by (a) requiring it, (b) setting up a market or market-based incentives, or (c) buying the land and 
doing it themselves. In each case, the required investment is the same – the planting cost plus the net foregone returns of agricultural 
rents – even though a different entity pays the cost. Private entities that pay for carbon credits will also bear the direct costs of 
planting plus the opportunity costs. In the case of avoided deforestation, opportunity costs similarly must be paid to individual actors 
to avoid the deforestation.
different mitigation policies affect the poor.
Cultural values and social acceptance. Barriers to adoption 
of AFOLU mitigation will be strongest where historical practices 
represent long-standing traditions (high confidence). Adoption 
of new mitigation practices, however, may proceed quickly if the 
technologies can be shown to improve crop yields, reduce costs, 
or otherwise improve livelihoods (Ranjan 2019). AR6 presents new 
estimates of the mitigation potential for shifts in diets and reductions 
in food waste, but given long-standing dietary traditions within most 
cultures, some of the strongest barriers exist for efforts to change 
diets (medium confidence). Furthermore, the large number of 
undernourished who may benefit from increased calories and meat 
will complicate efforts to change diets. Regulatory or tax approaches 
will face strong resistance, while efforts to use educational 
approaches and voluntary measures have limited potential to slow 
changes in consumption patterns due to free-riders, rebound effects, 
and other limitations. Food loss and waste occurs across the supply 
chain, creating significant challenges to reduce it (FAO 2019c). Where 
food loss occurs in the production stage, in other words, in fields 
at harvest, there may be opportunities to align reductions in food 
waste with improved production efficiency, however, adoption of 
new production methods often requires new investments or changes 
in labour practices, both of which are barriers.
7.6.4.2 Institutional Barriers and Opportunities
Transparent and accountable governance. Good governance and 
accountability are crucial for implementation of forest and agriculture 
mitigation. Effective nature-based mitigation will require large-scale 
estimation, modelling, monitoring, reporting and verification of 
GHG inventories, mitigation actions, as well as their implications for 
sustainable development goals and their interactions with climate 
change impacts and adaptation. Efforts must be made to integrate 
the accounting from projects to the country level. While global 
datasets have emerged to measure forest loss, at least temporarily 
(e.g.,  Hansen et al. 2013), similar datasets do not yet exist for 
forest degradation and agricultural carbon stocks or fluxes. Most 
developing countries have insufficient capacity to address research 
needs, modelling, monitoring, reporting and data requirements 
(Ravindranath et al. 2017), compromising transparency, accuracy, 
completeness, consistency and comparability.
Opportunity for political participation of local stakeholders is barrier 
in most places where forest ownership rights are not sufficiently 
documented (Essl et al. 2018). Since incentives for self-enforcement 
can have an important influence on deforestation rates (Fortmann 
et al. 2017), weak governance and insecure property rights are 
significant barriers to introduction of forest carbon offset projects 
in developing countries, where many of the low-cost options for 
such projects exist (Gren and Zeleke 2016). Governance challenges 
exist at all levels of government, with poor coordination, insufficient 
information sharing, and concerns over accountability playing 
a prominent role within REDD+ projects and programmes (Ravikumar 
et al. 2015). In some cases, governments are increasingly centralising 
REDD+ governance and limiting the distribution of governance functions between state and non-state actors (Zelli et al. 2017; Phelps 
et al. 2010). Overlap and duplication in Forest Law Enforcement, 
Governance and Trade (FLEGT) and REDD+ also limits governance 
effectiveness (Gupta et al. 2016).
Clear land tenure and land-use rights. Unclear property rights 
and tenure insecurity undermine the incentives to improve forest and 
agricultural productivity, lead to food insecurity, undermine REDD+ 
objectives, discourage adoption of farm conservation practices, 
discourage tree planting and forest management, and exacerbate 
conflict between different land users (Antwi-Agyei et al. 2015; Felker 
et al. 2017; Sunderlin et al. 2018; Borras and Franco 2018; Riggs 
et al. 2018; Kansanga and Luginaah 2019). Some positive signs 
exist as over 500 million hectares of forests have been converted 
to community management with clear property rights in the past 
two decades (Rights and Resources Initiative 2018), but adoption of 
forest and agricultural mitigation practices will be limited in large 
remaining areas with unclear property rights (Gupta et al. 2016).
Lack of institutional capacity. Institutional complexity, or lack 
thereof, represents a major challenge when implementing large and 
complex mitigation programmes (e.g., REDD+) in agriculture, forest 
and other land uses (Bäckstrand et al. 2017). Without sufficient 
capacity, many synergies between agricultural and forest programs, 
or mitigation and adaptation opportunities, may be missed (Duguma 
et al. 2014). Another aspect of institutional complexity is the 
different biophysical and socio-economic circumstances as well as 
the public and private financial means involved in the architecture 
and implementation of REDD+ and other initiatives (Zelli et al. 2017).
7.6.4.3 Ecological Barriers and Opportunities
Availability of land and water. Climate mitigation scenarios 
in the two recent special reports (SR1.5 and SRCCL) that aim to 
limit global temperature increase to 2°C or less involve carbon 
dioxide (CO 2) removal from the atmosphere. To support large-scale 
CDR, these scenarios involve significant land-use change, due to 
afforestation/reforestation, avoided deforestation, and deployment 
of biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). While 
a considerable amount of land is certainly available for new forests 
or new bioenergy crops, that land has current uses that will affect not 
only the costs, but also the willingness of current users or owners, 
to shift uses. Regions with private property rights and a history of 
market-based transactions may be the most feasible for land-use 
change or land management change to occur. Areas with less secure 
tenure or a land market with fewer transactions in general will likely 
face important hurdles that limit the feasibility of implementing 
novel nature-based solutions.
Implementation of nature-based solution may have local or regionally 
important consequences for other ecosystem services, some of which 
may be negative (high confidence). Land-use change has important 
implications for the hydrological cycle, and the large land-use shifts 
suggested for BECCS when not carried out in a  carefully planned 
manner, are expected to increase water demands substantially across 
the globe (Stenzel et al. 2019; Rosa et al. 2020). Afforestation can 
have minor to severe consequences for surface water acidification, 
and sea-salts (Futter et al. 2019). The potential effects of coastal 
afforestation on sea-salt related acidification could lead to re-
acidification and damage on aquatic biota.
Specific soil conditions, water availability, GHG emission-
reduction potential as well as natural variability and resilience. 
Recent analysis by (Cook-Patton et al. 2020) illustrates large 
variability in potential rates of carbon accumulation for afforestation 
and reforestation options, both within biomes/ecozones and across 
them. Their results suggest that while there is large potential for 
afforestation and reforestation, the carbon uptake potential in 
land-based climate change mitigation efforts is highly dependent 
on the assumptions related to climate drivers, land use and land 
management, and soil carbon responses to land-use change. Less 
analysis has been conducted on bioenergy crop yields, however, 
bioenergy crop yields are also likely to be highly variable, suggesting 
that bioenergy supply could exceed or fall short of expectations in 
a given region, depending on site conditions.
The effects of climate change on ecosystems, including changes in 
crop yields, shifts in terrestrial ecosystem productivity, vegetation 
migration, wildfires, and other disturbances also will affect the 
potential for AFOLU mitigation. Climate is expected to reduce crop 
yields, increase crop and livestock prices, and increase pressure on 
undisturbed forest land for food production creating new barriers and 
increasing costs for implementation of many nature-based mitigation 
techniques (medium confidence) (IPCC AR6 WGII Chapter 5).
The observed increase in the terrestrial sink over the past half century 
can be linked to changes in the global environment, such as increased 
atmospheric CO 2 concentrations, N deposition, or changes in climate 
(Ballantyne et al. 2012), though not always proven from ground-based 
information (Vandersleen et al. 2015). While the terrestrial sink relies 
on regrowth in secondary forests (Houghton and Nassikas 2017), 
there is emerging evidence that the sink will slow in the Northern 
Hemisphere as forests age (Nabuurs et al. 2013), although saturation 
may take decades (Zhu et al. 2018). Forest management through 
replanting, variety selection, fertilisation, and other management 
techniques, has increased the terrestrial carbon sink over the last 
century (Mendelsohn and Sohngen 2019). Saturation of the sink in 
situ may not occur when, for example, substitution effects of timber 
usage are also considered.
Increasing concentrations of CO 2 are expected to increase carbon 
stocks globally, with the strongest effects in the tropics (Schimel et al. 
2015; Kim et al. 2017a) (IPCC AR6 WGII Chapter 5) and economic 
models suggest that future sink potential may be robust to the 
impacts of climate change (Tian et al. 2018). However, it is uncertain 
if this large terrestrial carbon sink will continue in the future (Aragão 
et al. 2018), as it is increasingly recognised that gains due to CO 2 
fertilisation are constrained by climate and increasing disturbances 
(Schurgers et al. 2018; Duffy et al. 2021) (IPCC AR6 WGII Chapter 5). 
Further, negative synergies between local impacts like deforestation 
and forest fires may interact with global drivers like climate change 
and lead to tipping points (Lovejoy and Nobre 2018). Factors that 
reduce permanence or slow forest growth will drive up costs of forest mitigation measures, suggesting that climate change presents 
a formidable challenge to implementation of nature-based solutions 
beyond 2030 (high confidence).
In addition to climate change, Dooley and Kartha (2018) also note 
that technological and social factors could ultimately limit the 
feasibility of agricultural and forestry mitigation options, especially 
when deployed at large scale. Concern is greatest with widespread 
use of bioenergy crops, which could lead to forest losses (Harper 
et al. 2018). Deployment of BECCS and forest-based mitigation 
can be complementary (Favero et al. 2017; Baker et al. 2019), but 
inefficient policy approaches could lead to net carbon emissions if 
BECCS replaces high-carbon content ecosystems with crops.
Adaptation benefits and biodiversity conservation. Biodiversity 
may improve resilience to climate change impacts as more-diverse 
systems could be more resilient to climate change impacts, thereby 
maintaining ecosystem function and preserving biodiversity (Hisano 
et al. 2018). However, losses in ecosystem functions due species 
shifts or reductions in diversity may impair the positive effects of 
biodiversity on ecosystems. Forest management strategies based on 
biodiversity and ecosystems functioning interactions can augment 
the effectiveness of forests in reducing climate change impacts 
on ecosystem functioning (high confidence). In spite of the many 
synergies between climate policy instruments and biodiversity 
conservation, however, current policies often fall short of realising 
this potential (Essl et al. 2018).
7.6.4.4 Technological Barriers and Opportunities
Monitoring, reporting, and verification. Development of satellite 
technologies to assess potential deforestation has grown in recent 
years with the release of 30 m data by Hansen et al. (2013), however, 
this data only captures tree cover loss, and increasing accuracy over 
time may limit its use for trend analysis (Ceccherini et al. 2020; Palahí 
et al. 2021). Datasets on forest losses are less well developed for 
reforestation and afforestation. As Mitchell et al. (2017) point out, 
there has been significant improvement in the ability to measure 
changes in tree and carbon density on sites using satellite data, but 
these techniques are still evolving and improving and they are not yet 
available for widespread use.
Ground-based forest inventory measurements have been developed 
in many countries, most prominently in the Northern Hemisphere, 
but more and more countries are starting to develop and collect 
national forest inventories. Training and capacity building is going on 
in many developing countries under UNREDD and FAO programmes. 
Additional efforts to harmonise data collection methods and to make 
forest inventory data available to the scientific community would 
improve confidence in forest statistics, and changes in forest statistics 
over time. To some extent the Global Forest Biodiversity Initiative fills 
in this data gap (https://gfbi.udl.cat/).
being and Adaptation (including SDGs)
The linkage between biodiversity, ecosystem services, human 
well-being and sustainable development is widely acknowledged 
(Millenium Ecosystem Assesment 2005; UNEP 2019). Loss of 
biodiversity and ecosystem services will have an adverse impact on 
quality of life, human well-being and sustainable development (IPBES 
2019a). Such losses will not only affect current economic growth but 
also impede the capacity for future economic growth.
Population growth, economic development, urbanisation, technology, 
climate change, global trade and consumption, policy and governance 
are key drivers of global environmental change over recent decades 
(Kram et al. 2014; UNEP 2019; WWF 2020). Changes in biodiversity and 
ecosystem services are mainly driven by habitat loss, climate change, 
invasive species, over-exploitation of natural resources, and pollution 
(Millenium Ecosystem Assesment 2005). The relative importance of 
these drivers varies across biomes, regions, and countries. Climate 
change is expected to be a major driver of biodiversity loss in the 
coming decades, followed by commercial forestry and bioenergy 
production (OECD 2012; UNEP 2019). Population growth along with 
rising incomes and changes in consumption and dietary patterns, will 
exert immense pressure on land and other natural resources (IPCC 
2019). Current estimates suggest that 75% of the land surface has 
been significantly anthropogenically altered, with 66% of the ocean 
area experiencing increasing cumulative impacts and over 85% 
of wetland area lost (IPBES 2019a). As discussed, in Section  7.3, 
land-use change is driven amongst others by agriculture, forestry 
(logging and fuelwood harvesting), infrastructural development and 
urbanisation, all of which may also generate localised air, water, 
and soil pollution (IPBES 2019a). Over a  third of the world’s land 
surface and nearly three-quarters of available freshwater resources 
are devoted to crop or livestock production (IPBES 2019a). Despite 
a  slight reduction in global agricultural area since 2000, regional 
agricultural area expansion has occurred in Latin America and the 
Caribbean, Africa and the Middle East (FAO 2019c; OECD and FAO 
2019). The degradation of tropical forests and biodiversity hotspots, 
endangers habitat for many threatened and endemic species, 
and reduces valuable ecosystem services. However, trends vary 
considerably by region. As noted in Section 7.3, global forest area 
declined by roughly 178 Mha between 1990 and 2020 (FAO 2020a), 
though the rate of net forest loss has decreased over the period, 
due to reduced deforestation in some countries and forest gains 
in others. Between 1990 to 2015, forest cover fell by almost 13% 
in South-East Asia, largely due to an increase in timber extraction, 
large-scale biofuel plantations and expansion of intensive agriculture 
and shrimp farms, whereas in North-East Asia and South Asia it 
increased by 23% and 6% respectively, through policy instruments 
such as joint forest management, payment for ecosystem services, 
and restoration of degraded forests (IPBES 2018b). It is lamenting 
that the area under natural forests which are rich in biodiversity 
and provide diverse ecosystem services decreased by 301 Mha 
between 1990 and 2020, decreasing in most regions except Europe 
and Oceania with largest losses reported in sub-Saharan Africa 
(FAO 2020a). The increasing trend of mining in forest and coastal 
areas, and in river basins for extracting has had significant negative impacts on biodiversity, air and water quality, water distribution, 
and on human health (Section 7.3). Freshwater ecosystems equally 
face a series of combined threats including from land-use change, 
water extraction, exploitation, pollution, climate change and invasive 
species (IPBES 2019a).
7.6.5.1 Ecosystem Services
An evaluation of eighteen ecosystem services over the past five 
decades (1970–2019) found only four (agricultural production, 
fish harvest, bioenergy production and harvest of materials) to 
demonstrate increased performance, while the remaining fourteen, 
mostly concerning regulating and non-material contributions, were 
found to be in decline (IPBES 2019a). The value of global agricultural 
output (over USD3.54 trillion in 2018) had increased approximately 
threefold since 1970, and roundwood production (industrial 
roundwood and fuelwood) by 27%, between 1980 to 2018, reaching 
some 4 billion m3 in 2018. However, the positive trends in these 
four ecosystem services does not indicate long-term sustainability. 
If increases in agricultural production are realised through forest 
clearance or through increasing energy-intensive inputs, gains are 
likely to be unsustainable in the long run. Similarly, an increase in 
fish production may involve overfishing, leading to local species 
declines which also impacts fish prices, fishing revenues, and the 
well-being of coastal and fishing communities (Sumaila and Lam 
2020). Climate change and other drivers are likely to affect future fish 
catch potential, although impacts will differ across regions (Sumaila 
et al. 2017; Domke et al. 2019).
The increasing trend in aquaculture production especially in South 
and South-East Asia through intensive methods affects existing food 
production and ecosystems by diverting rice fields or mangroves 
(Bhattacharya and Ninan 2011). Although extensive traditional 
fish farming of carp in central Europe can contribute to landscape 
management, enhance biodiversity and provide ecosystem services, 
there are several barriers to scale up production due to strict 
EU environmental regulations, vulnerability to extreme weather 
events, and to avian predators that are protected by EU laws, and 
disadvantages faced by small-scale enterprises that dominate the 
sector (European-Commission 2021). Bioenergy production may have 
high opportunity costs in land-scarce areas and compete with land 
used for food production which threatens food security and affects 
the poor and vulnerable. But these impacts will differ across scale, 
contexts and other factors.
Currently, land degradation is estimated to have reduced productivity 
in 23% of the global terrestrial area, and between USD235 billion 
and USD577 billion in annual global crop output is at risk because 
of pollinator loss (IPBES 2019a). The global trends reviewed above 
are based on data from 2000 studies. It is not clear whether the 
assessment included a quality control check of the studies evaluated 
and suffer from aggregation bias. For instance, a  recent meta-
analysis of global forest valuation studies noted that many studies 
reviewed had shortcomings such as failing to clearly mention the 
methodology and prices used to value the forest ecosystem services, 
double counting, data errors, and so on (Ninan and Inoue 2013). 
Furthermore, the criticisms against the paper by (Costanza et al. 
are central to the processes that link all species to each other and their 
habitats, ignoring substitution effects may also apply to the global 
assessment (Smith 1997; Bockstael et al. 2000; Loomis et al. 2000). 
Land degradation has had a pronounced impact on ecosystem functions 
worldwide (IPBES 2018e). Net primary productivity of ecosystem 
biomass and of agriculture is presently lower than it would have been 
under a natural state on 23% of the global terrestrial area, amounting 
to a  5% reduction in total global net primary productivity (IPBES 
2018e). Over the past two centuries, soil organic carbon, an indicator 
of soil health, has seen an estimated 8% loss globally (176 GtC) from 
land conversion and unsustainable land management practices (IPBES 
2018e). Projections to 2050 predict further losses of 36 GtC from soils, 
particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. These losses are projected to come 
from the expansion of agricultural land into natural areas (16 GtC), 
degradation due to inappropriate land management (11 GtC) and the 
draining and burning of peatlands (9 GtC) and melting of permafrost  
(IPBES 2018e). Trends in biodiversity measured by the global living 
planet index between 1970 to 2016 indicate a  68% decline in 
monitored population of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and 
fish (WWF 2020). FAO’s recent report on the state of the world’s 
biodiversity for food and agriculture points to an alarming decline in 
biodiversity for food and agriculture including associated biodiversity 
such as pollination services, microorganisms which are essential for 
production systems (FAO 2019d). These suggest that overall ecosystem 
health is consistently declining with adverse consequences for good 
quality of life, human well-being, and sustainable development.
Although numerous studies have estimated the value of ecosystem 
services for different sites, ecosystems, and regions, these studies 
mostly evaluate ecosystem services at a  single point in time 
(Costanza et al. 1997; Xue and Tisdell 2001; Nahuelhual et al. 2007; de Groot et al. 2012; Ninan and Kontoleon 2016). The few studies 
that have assessed the trends in the value of ecosystem services 
provided by different ecosystems across regions and countries 
indicate a  declining trend (Costanza et al. 2014; Kubiszewski 
et al. 2017). Land-use change is a  major driver behind loss of 
biodiversity and ecosystem services in most regions (IPBES 2018b; 
IPBES 2018c, IPBES 2018d, Rice et al. 2018). Projected impacts of 
land-use change and climate change on biodiversity and ecosystem 
services (material and regulating services) between 2015 to 2050 
were assessed to have relatively less negative impacts under global 
sustainability scenarios as compared to regional competition and 
economic optimism scenarios (IPBES 2019a). The projected impacts 
were based on a  subset of Shared Socio-economic Pathway (SSP) 
scenarios and GHG emissions trajectories (RCP) developed in 
support of IPCC assessments. There are synergies, trade-offs and co-
benefits between ecosystem services and mitigation options with 
impacts on ecosystem services differing by scale and contexts (high 
confidence). Measures such as conservation agriculture, agroforestry, 
soil and water conservation, afforestation, adoption of silvopastoral 
systems, can help minimise trade-offs between mitigations options 
and ecosystem services (Duguma et al. 2014). Climate-smart 
agriculture (CSA) is being promoted to enable farmers to make 
agriculture more sustainable and adapt to climate change (Box 7.4). 
However, experience with CSA in Africa has not been encouraging. 
For instance, a  study of climate-smart cocoa production in Ghana 
shows that due to lack of tenure (tree) rights, bureaucratic and legal 
hurdles in registering trees in cocoa farms, and other barriers small 
cocoa producers could not realise the project benefits (Box  7.13). 
Experience of CSA in some other sub-Saharan African countries and 
other countries such as Belize too has been constrained by weak 
extension systems and policy implementation, and other barriers 
(Arakelyan et al. 2017; Kongsager 2017).
Box 7.13 | Case Study: Climate-smart Cocoa Production in Ghana
Policy objectives
i. To promote sustainable intensification of cocoa production and enhance the adaptive capacity of small cocoa producers.
ii. To reduce cocoa-induced deforestation and GHG emissions.
iii. To improve productivity, incomes, and livelihoods of smallholder cocoa producers.
Policy mix
The climate-smart cocoa (CSC) production programme in Ghana involved distributing shade tree seedlings that can protect cocoa 
plants from heat and water stress, enhance soil organic matter and water holding capacity of soils, and provide other assistance with 
agroforestry, giving access to extension services such as agronomic information and agrochemical inputs. The shade tree seedlings 
were distributed by NGOs, government extension agencies, and the private sector free of charge or at subsidised prices and was 
expected to reduce pressure on forests for growing cocoa plants. The CSC programme was mainly targeted at small farmers who 
constitute about 80% of total farm holdings in Ghana. Although the government extension agency (Cocobod) undertook mass spraying 
or pruning of cocoa farms they found it difficult to access the 800,000 cocoa smallholders spread across the tropical south of the 
country. The project brought all stakeholders together, in other words, the government, private sector, local farmers and civil society or 
NGOs to facilitate the sustainable intensification of cocoa production in Ghana. Creation of a community-based governance structure 
was expected to promote benefit sharing, forest conservation, adaptation to climate change, and enhanced livelihood opportunities.
Development Goals
Conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services is part of the 
larger objective of building climate resilience and promoting good 
quality of life, human well-being and sustainable development. 
While two of the 17 SDGs directly relate to nature (SDGs 14 and 15 
covering marine and terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity), most 
other SDGs relating to poverty, hunger, inequality, health and well-
being, clean sanitation and water, energy, and so on, are directly or 
indirectly linked to nature (Blicharska et al. 2019). A survey among 
experts to assess how 16 ecosystem services could help in achieving 
the SDGs relating to good environment and human well-being 
suggested that ecosystem services could contribute to achieving 
about 41 targets across 12 SDGs (Wood et al. 2018). They also 
indicated cross-target interactions and synergetic outcomes across 
many SDGs. Conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services 
is critical to sustaining the well-being and livelihoods of poor and 
marginalised people, and indigenous communities who depend on 
natural resources (high confidence). Nature provides a broad array of 
goods and services that are critical to good quality of life and human 
well-being. Healthy and diverse ecosystems can play an important 
role in reducing vulnerability and building resilience to disasters 
and extreme weather events (SCBD 2009; The Royal Society Science 
Policy Centre 2014; Ninan and Inoue 2017).Current negative trends in biodiversity and ecosystem services will 
undermine progress towards achieving 80% (35 out of 44) of the 
assessed targets of SDGs related to poverty, hunger, health, water, 
cities, climate, oceans and land (IPBES 2019a). However, Reyers and 
Selig (2020) note that the assessment by (IPBES 2019a) could only 
assess the consequences of trends in biodiversity and ecosystem 
services for 35 out of the 169 SDG targets due to data and knowledge 
gaps, and lack of clarity about the relationship between biodiversity, 
ecosystem services and SDGs.
Progress in achieving the 20 Aichi Biodiversity targets which are 
critical for realising the SDGs has been poor with most of the targets 
not being achieved or only partially realised (SCBD 2020). There 
could be synergies and trade-offs between ecosystem services and 
human well-being. For instance, a study notes that although policy 
interventions and incentives to enhance supply of provisioning 
services (e.g.,  agricultural production) have led to higher GDP , it 
may have an adverse effect on the regulatory services of ecosystems 
(Kirchner et al. 2015). However, we are aware of the inadequacies 
of traditional GDP as an indicator of well-being. In this context the 
Dasgupta Biodiversity Review argues for using the inclusive wealth 
approach to accurately measure social well-being by tracking the 
changes in produced, human and natural capital (Dasgupta 2021). 
Targets for nature (biodiversity and ecosystem services) should be 
refined so as to fit in with the metrics tracked by the SDGs (IPBES 
2016; Rosa et al. 2017).Box 7.13 (continued)
Governance context
 
Critical enablers
The role assigned to local government mechanisms such as Ghana’s Community Resource Management Area Mechanisms (CREMAs) 
was expected to give a  voice to smallholders who are an important stakeholder in Ghana’s cocoa sector. CREMAs are inclusive 
because authority and ownership of natural resources are devolved to local communities who can thus have a voice in influencing CSC 
policy thereby ensuring equity and adapting CSC to local contexts. However, ensuring the long-term sustainability of CREMAs will help 
to make them a reliable mechanism for farmers to voice their concerns and aspirations, and ensure their independence as a legitimate 
governance structure in the long run. The private sector was assigned an important role to popularise climate-smart cocoa production 
in Ghana. However, whether this will work to the advantage of smallholder cocoa producers needs to be seen.
Critical barriers
The policy intervention overlooks the institutional constraints characteristic of the cocoa sector in Ghana where small farmers are 
dominant and have skewed access to resources and markets. Lack of secure tenure (tree rights) where the ownership of shade trees 
and timber vests with the state, bureaucratic and legal hurdles to register trees in their cocoa farms are major constraints that impede 
realisation of the expected benefits of the CSC programme. This is a great disincentive for small cocoa producers to implement CSC 
initiatives and nurture the shade tree seedlings and undertake land improvement measures. The state marketing board has the 
monopoly in buying and marketing of cocoa beans including exports which impeded CREMAs or farming communities from directly 
selling their produce to MNCs and traders. However, many MNCs have been involved in setting up of CREMA or similar structures, 
extending premium prices and non-monetary benefits (access to credit, shade tree seedlings, agrochemicals) thus indirectly securing 
their cocoa supply chains. A biased ecological discourse about the benefits of climate-smart agriculture and sustainable intensive 
narrative, complexities regarding the optimal shade levels for growing cocoa, and dependence on agrochemicals are issues that affect 
the success and sustainability of the project intervention. Dominance of private sector players especially MNCs in the sector may be 
detrimental to the interests of smallholder cocoa producers (Nasser et al. 2020).
Combined mitigation and adaptation approaches have been 
highlighted throughout Section  7.4 regarding specific measures. 
Land-based mitigation and adaptation to the risks posed by climate 
change and extreme weather events can have several co-benefits 
as well as help promote development and conservation goals. 
Land-based mitigation and adaptation will not only help reduce 
GHG emissions in the AFOLU sector, but measures are required to 
closely link up with adaptation. In the central 2°C scenario, improved 
management of land and more efficient forest practices, a reduction 
in deforestation and an increase in afforestation, would account 
for 10% of the total mitigation effort over 2015–2050 (Keramidas 
et al. 2018). If managed and regulated appropriately, the Land 
sector could become carbon-neutral as early as 2030–2035, being 
a key sector for emissions reductions beyond 2025 (Keramidas et al. 
2018). Nature-based solutions (NBS) with safeguards has immense 
potential for cost-effective adaptation to climate change; but their 
impacts will vary by scale and contexts (high confidence). Griscom 
et al. 2017 estimate this potential to provide 37% of cost-effective 
CO2 mitigation until 2030 needed to meet 2°C goals with likely co-
benefits for biodiversity. However, due to the time lag for technology 
deployment and natural carbon gain this mitigation potential of NBS 
by 2030 or 2050 can be delayed or much lower than the estimated 
potential (Qin et al. 2021).
7.7 Knowledge Gaps
Closing knowledge gaps and narrowing uncertainties are crucial to 
advance AFOLU mitigation. Knowledge gaps exist across a  range 
of areas, from emissions accounting and mitigation measure 
development to integration of scientific and traditional knowledge 
and development and sustainable implementation strategies. The 
following are identified as priorities:
• Uncertainty in contemporary emissions and sinks within AFOLU 
is still high. There is ongoing need to develop and refine emission 
factors, improve activity data and facilitate knowledge exchange, 
concerning inventories and accounting. For example, insufficient 
knowledge on CO 2 emissions relating to forest management and 
burning or draining of organic soils (wetlands and peatlands), 
limits certainty on CO 2 and CH 4 fluxes.
• Improved monitoring of the land CO 2 balance is urgently 
needed, including impacts of land degradation and restoration 
efforts (e.g.,  in tropical and boreal regions), making use of 
combined remote sensing, artificial intelligence, ground-based 
and modelling tools (Grassi et al. 2021). Improved estimates 
would provide more reliable projections of nationally determined 
contributions to emissions reduction and enhancement of sinks, 
and reconciliation of national accounting and modelling results 
(Nabuurs et al. 2019).
• The future impacts of climate change on land systems are highly 
uncertain, for example, the role of permafrost thaw, tipping 
points, increased disturbances and enhanced CO 2 fertilisation 
(Friedlingstein et al. 2020). Further research into these mechanisms is critical to better understand the permanence of 
mitigation measures in land sector.
• There is need to understand the role of forest management, 
carbon and nitrogen fertilisation and associated interactions in 
the current forest carbon sink that has emerged in the last 50 to 

between bookkeeping models and other methodologies.
• Continued research into novel and emerging mitigation measures 
and associated cost efficiency (e.g.,  CH 4 inhibitors or vaccines 
for ruminants) is required. In addition to developing specific 
measures, research is also needed into best practice regarding 
implementation and optimal agricultural land and livestock 
management at regional and country level. Further research into 
the feasible mitigation potential of sustainable intensification 
in terms of absolute GHG emissions and appropriate policy 
mechanisms, is required to implement and advance this strategy.
• Research into accounting systems and policy options that will 
enable agricultural soil and forest carbon to be utilised as offsets 
(voluntary or regulatory) is needed to increase financing for land-
based CDR. Design of incentives that consider local institutions 
and novel frameworks for cooperation between private finance 
and public governance can encourage investment. Equally, 
research to adjust or remove regulations and subsidy schemes that 
may hamper land-based mitigation efforts, is urgently required.
• Improving mitigation potential estimates, whether derived from 
sectoral studies or IAMs to account for biophysical climate 
effects, and impacts of future climate change (e.g.,  mitigation 
permanence), biodiversity loss and corresponding feedbacks is 
needed. IAM ‘usability’ can be enhanced by integrating a wider 
set of measures and incorporating sustainability considerations.
• Research into the feasibility of improving and enhancing 
sustainable agricultural and forestry value chains, provision of 
renewable products (building with wood) and the sustainability 
of bioenergy is critically important. Modelled scenarios do not 
examine many poverty, employment and development trade-offs, 
which are highly context specific and vary enormously by region. 
Trade-off analysis and cost-benefit analysis can assist decision-
making and policy.
• In-depth understanding of mitigation-SDG interactions is critical 
for identifying mitigation options that maximise synergies 
and minimise trade-offs. Mitigation measures have important 
synergies, trade-offs and co-benefits, impacting biodiversity 
and resource-use, human well-being, ecosystem services, 
adaptation capacity and many SDGs. In addition to exploring 
localised economic implementation costs, studies are needed to 
understand how measures will impact and interact with wider 
environmental and social factors across localities and contexts.
FAQ 7.1 |   Why is the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Uses (AFOLU) sector unique when 
considering GHG mitigation?
There are three principal reasons that make the AFOLU sector unique in terms of mitigation:
In contrast to other sectors, AFOLU can facilitate mitigation in several different ways. Specifically, AFOLU can (i) reduce emissions as 
a sector in its own right, (ii) remove meaningful quantities of carbon from the atmosphere and relatively cheaply, and (iii) provide 
raw materials to enable mitigation within other sectors, such as energy, industry or the built environment.
The emissions profile of AFOLU differs from other sectors, with a greater proportion of non-CO 2 gases (N 2O and CH 4). The impacts of 
mitigation efforts within AFOLU can vary according to which gases are targeted, as a result of the differing atmospheric lifetime of 
the gases and differing global temperature responses to the accumulation of the specific gases in the atmosphere.
In addition to tackling climate change, AFOLU mitigation measures have capacity, where appropriately implemented, to help address 
some critical, wider challenges, as well as contributing to climate change adaptation. AFOLU is inextricably linked with some of 
the most serious challenges that are suggested to have ever faced humanity, such as large-scale biodiversity loss, environmental 
degradation and the associated consequences. As AFOLU concerns land management and utilises a considerable portion of the 
Earth’s terrestrial area, the sector greatly influences soil, water and air quality, biological and social diversity, the provision of natural 
habitats, and ecosystem functioning, consequently impacting many SDGs.
FAQ 7.2 |  What AFOLU measures have the greatest economic mitigation potential?
Economic mitigation potential refers to the mitigation estimated to be possible at an annual cost of up to USD100 tCO 2–1 mitigated. 
This cost is deemed the price at which society is willing to pay for mitigation and is used as a proxy to estimate the proportion of 
technical mitigation potential that could realistically be implemented. Between 2020 and 2050, measures concerning forests and 
other ecosystem are estimated to have an average annual mitigation potential of 7.3 (3.9–13.1) GtCO 2-eq yr–1 at USD100 tCO 2–1. 
At the same cost, agricultural measures are estimated to have a potential of 4.1 (1.7–6.7) GtCO 2-eq yr–1. Emerging technologies, 
such as CH 4 vaccines and inhibitors, could sustainably increase agricultural mitigation potential in future. The diverted production 
effects of changes in demand (reduced food losses, diet changes and improved and enhanced wood products use), is estimated to 
have an economic potential of 2.2 (1.1–3.6) GtCO 2-eq yr–1. However, cost forms only one constraint to mitigation, with realisation 
of economic potential dependent on multiple context-specific environmental and socio-cultural factors.
FAQ 7.3 |   What are potential impacts of large-scale establishment of dedicated bioenergy 
plantations and crops and why is it so controversial?
The potential of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) remains a focus of debate with several studies evaluating the 
level at which BECCS could be sustainably implemented, published since AR5. BECCS involves sequestering carbon through plant 
growth (i.e., in trees or crops) and capturing the carbon generated when this biomass is processed for power or fuel. The captured 
carbon then requires long-term storage in for example, geological, terrestrial or ocean reservoirs, or in products. While appearing to 
create a net removal of carbon from the atmosphere, BECCS requires land, water and energy which can create adverse side effects 
at scale. Controversy has arisen because some of the models calculating the energy mix required to keep the temperature to 1.5°C 
have included BECCS at very large scales as a means of both providing energy and removing carbon from the atmosphere to offset 
emissions from industry, power, transport or heat. For example, studies have calculated that for BECCS to achieve 11.5 GtCO 2-eq 
per year of carbon removal in 2100, as envisaged in one scenario, 380–700 Mha or 25–46% of all the world’s arable and cropland 
would be needed. In such a  situation, competition for agricultural land seriously threatens food production and food security, 
while also impacting biodiversity, water and soil quality, and landscape aesthetic value. More recently however, the scenarios for 
BECCS have become much more realistic, though concerns regarding impacts on food security and the environment remain, while 
the reliability of models is uncertain due to methodological flaws. Improvements to models are required to better capture wider 
environmental and social impacts of BECCS in order to ascertain its sustainable contribution in emissions pathways. Additionally, 
the opportunity for other options that could negate very large-scale deployment of BECCS, such as other carbon dioxide removal 
measures or more stringent emission reductions in other sectors, could be explored within models.
